          <name>Gold (gp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

          <name>Copper (cp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

        <name>LMoP: Goblin Arrows Intro (Read)</name>
        <text>In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagon load of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days&#39; travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found "something big," and that he&#39;d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen&#39;s Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Haliwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to "take care of business."

You&#39;ve spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you&#39;ve just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail. You&#39;ve encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Driving the Wagon</name>
        <text>Any character can drive a wagon, and no particular skill is necessary. Two oxen pull the wagon. If no one is holding the reins, the oxen stop where they are.

The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.

When you&#39;re ready, continue with the "Goblin Ambush" section.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Goblin Ambush (200xp)</name>
        <text>—————————————————————————
You&#39;ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.
—————————————————————————

If you are using the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They&#39;ve been dead about a day, and it&#39;s clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:

—————————————————————————
The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.
—————————————————————————

Four goblins are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.

In the unlikely event that the goblins defeat the adventurers, they leave them unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the Cragmaw hideout. The characters can continue on to Phandalin, buy new gear at Barthen&#39;s Provisions, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins&#39; trail.

The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. Once it regains consciousness after a few minutes, a captured goblin can be convinced to share what it knows (see the "What the Goblins Know" sidebar on page 8). A goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps along the way (see the "Goblin Trail" section).

The characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin. In that case, skip ahead to part 2, "Phandalin." Elmar Barthen (the owner of Barthen&#39;s Provisions) seeks out the characters and informs them that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived. He recounts the goblin troubles and suggests that the characters return to the ambush site to investigate further (after they rest). Barthen also tells the party that Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster (see page 16) can provide more information on the goblin attacks.

        <name>LMoP: Goblin Trail (100xp)</name>
        <text>After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.
The party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins.

The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout (see that section). Ask the players to determine the party&#39;s marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.

Snare
—————————————————————————
About 10 minutes after heading down the trail,
a party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character
is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare&#39;s cord. (See the appendix in the rulebook for the effect of being restrained.) A character who isn&#39;t carefully lowered down takes Id6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.

Pit
—————————————————————————
Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit.

If the trap isn&#39;t detected, the lead character must succeed
on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking Id6 bludgeoning damage. The pit&#39;s walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.</text>

        <name>LMoP: What the Goblins Know</name>
        <text>If the characters capture or charm any of the goblins here, the goblins can be persuaded to divulge some useful information:

• Fewer than twenty goblins currently dwell in the lair.
• Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg. He answers to King
Grol, chief of the Cragmaw tribe, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. (The goblins can provide basic directions to Cragmaw Castle. It&#39;s about twenty miles northeast of the Cragmaw hideout, in Neverwinter Wood.)
• Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few
days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, capture him, and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klarg followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map.
• The dwarf and his map were delivered to King Grol, as instructed. The dwarf&#39;s human companion is being held in the "eating cave" (area 6).</text>

        <name>LMoP: Cragmaw Hideout</name>
        <text>The Cragmaw tribe of goblins has established a hideout from which it can easily harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin. The Cragrnaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.

The leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a bugbear named Klarg, who has orders from the chief of the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.

        <name>LMoP: Cragmaw Hideout (Features)</name>
        <text>The Cragmaw cave slopes steeply upward. The entrance is at the foot of a good-sized hill, and the caves and passages are inside the hill itself.

Ceilings. Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.

Light. Areas 1 and 2 are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.

Rubble. Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain (see "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook).

Sound. The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren&#39;t listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.

Stalagmites. These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover (see "Cover" in the rulebook).

Stream. The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.</text>

        <name>LMoP: CH - 1. Cave Mouth</name>
        <text>The trail from the goblin ambush site leads to the entrance
of the Cragmaw hideout.

—————————————————————————
Following the goblins&#39; trail, you come across a large cave in
a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right-hand side of the stream.
—————————————————————————

The thicket in area 2 is impenetrable from the west side of the stream.

Developments
The goblins in area 2 are supposed to be keeping watch on this area, but they are not paying attention. (Goblins can be lazy that way.) However, if the characters make a lot of noise here-for example, loudly arguing about what to do next, setting up a camp, cutting down brush, and so on-the goblins in area 2 notice and attack them through the thicket, which provides the goblins with three-quarters cover (see the rule book for rules on cover).</text>

        <name>LMoP: CH - 2. Goblin Blind</name>
        <text>When the characters cross to the east side of the stream, they can see around the screening thickets to area 2. This is a goblin guard post, though the goblins here are bored and inattentive.

—————————————————————————
On the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten out the briars and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the area-including a pair of goblins lurking there right now!
—————————————————————————

Two goblins are stationed here. If the goblins notice intruders in area 1, they open fire with their bows, shooting through the thickets and probably catching the characters by surprise. If the goblins don&#39;t notice the adventurers in area 1, they spot them when they splash across the stream, and neither side is surprised.

Characters moving carefully or scouting ahead might be able to surprise the goblin lookouts. Have each character who moves ahead make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the goblins&#39; passive Wisdom (Perception)score to avoid being surprised. See the rulebook for more information on ability check contests.

Thickets: The thickets around the clearing are difficult terrain, but they aren&#39;t dangerous-just annoying. They provide half cover to creatures attacking through them. (See "Difficult Terrain" and "Cover" in the rulebook for more information.)</text>

      <note>
        <name>LMoP: CH - 3. Kennel</name>
        <text>The Cragmaws keep a kennel of foul-tempered wolves that they are training for battle.

—————————————————————————
Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead
up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where two wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf&#39;s chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.
—————————————————————————

Three wolves are confined here. They can&#39;t reach targets standing on the steps, but all three attack any creature except a goblin that moves into the room (see the "Developments" section). Goblins in nearby caves ignore the sounds of fighting wolves, since they constantly snap and snarl at each other.

A character who tries-to calm the animals can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, the wolves allow the character to move throughout the room. If the wolves are given food, the DC drops to 10.

Fissure: A narrow opening in the east wall leads to a natural chimney that climbs 30 feet to area 8. At the base of the fissure is rubbish that&#39;s been discarded through opening above. A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. On a check result of 6-9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes Id6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the base of the shaft.

DEVELOPMENTS
If the wolves are goaded by enemies beyond their reach, they are driven into a frenzy that allows them to yank the iron rod securing their chains out of the floor. Each round that any character remains in sight, the wolves attempt a single DC 15 Strength check. On the first success, they loosen the rod and the DC drops to 10. On a second success, they yank the rod loose, bending it so that their chains are freed.

A goblin or bugbear can use its action to release one wolf from its chain.

        <name>LMoP: CH - 4. Steep Passage</name>
        <text>From this point on, characters without darkvision will need light to see their surroundings.

———————————————————————
The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream.
———————————————————————

Characters using light or darkvision to look farther up the passage spot the bridge at area 5. Add:

———————————————————————
In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor.
———————————————————————

Any character who can see the bridge in area 5 might also notice the goblin guarding the bridge. Doing so requires a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin&#39;s Dexterity (Stealth) check result.

The goblin notices the characters if they carry any light or don&#39;t use stealth as they approach the bridge. The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in area 7 to release a flood (see the "Flood!" section of area 5). The goblin moves undetected if its Dexterity (Stealth) check exceeds the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of any character who might notice its movements.

Western Passage: This passage is choked with rubble and has steep escarpments. Treat the area as difficult terrain (see "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook).

The ledge between the two escarpments is fragile. Any weight in excess of 100 pounds loosens the whole mass and sends it tumbling down to the east. Any creature on the ledge when it falls must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. The creature also falls prone on a failed save (see "Being Prone" in the rulebook).</text>

        <name>LMoP: CH - 5. Overpass</name>
        <text>Where a high tunnel passes through the larger tunnel cavern below, the goblins have set up a bridge guard post.

——————————————————————-
The stream passage continues up beyond another set of
uneven steps ahead, bending eastward as it goes. A waterfall I sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you.
——————————————————————-

If the characters didn&#39;t spot the bridge while navigating area 4, they spot it now. Add:

——————————————————————-
A rickety bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels 1that are 20 feet above the stream.
——————————————————————-

One goblin stands watch on the bridge. It is hiding, and characters can spot it by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin&#39;s Dexterity (Stealth) check. This guard is lazy and inattentive. If no characters are using light sources, each character can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the goblin&#39;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to creep by without being noticed.

If the goblin spots the adventurers, it signals the goblins in area 7 to release a flood (see the "Flood!" section), then throws javelins down at the characters.

Bridge: This bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream. It&#39;s possible to climb up the cavern walls from the lower passage to the bridge. The 20-foot-high walls are rough but slick with spray, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb.
The bridge has an Armor Class (AC) of 5 and 10 hit points. If the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone (see "Being Prone" in the rulebook). Those who succeed hold onto the bridge and must climb it to safety.

        <name>LMoP: CH - Flood!</name>
        <text>The large pools in area 7 have collapsible walls that can be yanked out of place to release a surge of water down the main passage of the lair. In the round after the goblins in area 7 are signaled by the lookout in area 5, they start knocking away the supports. In the following round on the goblins&#39; initiative count, a water surge pours from area 7 down to area 1.

The passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge 1surge of rushing water pours down from above!

The flood threatens all creatures in the tunnel. (Creatures on the bridge at area 5 are out of danger, as are any characters successfully climbing the cavern walls.) Any creature within 10 feet of the disused passage at area 4 or the steps leading up to area 3 can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept away. A creature that fails to get out of the way can attempt a DC 15 Strength saving throw to hold on. On a failed save, the character is knocked prone and washed down to area 1, taking Id6 bludgeoning damage along the way.

The goblins in area 7 can release a second flood by opening the second pool, but they don&#39;t do this unless the goblin on the bridge tells them to. The goblin on the bridge waits to see if the first flood got rid of all the intruders before calling for the second to be released.

        <name>LMoP: CH - 6. Goblin Den</name>
        <text>The Cragmaw raiders stationed in the hideout use this area as a common room and barracks.

———————————————————————-
This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins.
———————————————————————-

Six goblins inhabit this den, and one of them is a leader with 12 hit points. The five ordinary goblins tend the cooking fire in the lower (northern) part of the cave near the entrance passage, while the leader rests in the upper (southern) part of the cave.

Sildar Hallwinter
A human warrior, is held prisoner in this chamber. He is securely bound on the southern ledge of the cavern. The goblins have been beating and tormenting him, so he is weak and at 1 hit point.

The goblin leader, Yeemik, is second-in-command of the whole hideout. If he sees that the characters are getting the upper hand, he grabs Sildar and drags him over to the edge of the upper level. "Truce, or this human dies!" he shouts.

Yeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new boss. If the adventurers agree to parley, Y~e.mik tries to(co~vince them to kill Klarg in area 8, prormsing to release Sildar when they bring back the bugbear&#39;s head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn&#39;t trust the goblin, and he&#39;s right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar even after they complete their part of the bargain.

If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and continues with the fight. Sildar takes Id6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points. Quick-acting characters can try to stabilize him before he dies (see "Damage, Healing, and Dying" in the rulebook).

If he is rescued and healed, Sildar Hallwinter remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn&#39;t have any weapons or armor, but he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character.
If Sildar joins the party, see the "NPC Party Members" sidebar for tips on how to run him.

TREASURE
Yeemik carries a pouch containing three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp. Sildar&#39;s gear, along with Gundren Rockseeker, was taken to Cragmaw Castle.</text>

        <name>LMoP: CH - 7. Twin Pools Cave</name>
        <text>————————————————————————-
This cavern is half filled with two large pools of water. A narrow waterfall high in the eastern wall feeds the pool, which drains out the western end of the chamber to form the stream that flows out of the cave mouth below. Low fieldstone walls serve as dams holding the water in. A wide exit stands to the south, while two smaller passages lead west. The sound of the waterfall echoes through the cavern, making it difficult to hear.
————————————————————————-

Three goblins guard this cave. If the goblin in area 5 spotted the characters and warned the goblins here, they are ready for trouble. The noise of the waterfall means that the creatures in area 8 can&#39;t hear any fighting that takes place here, and vice versa. Therefore, as soon as a fight breaks out here, one goblin flees to area 8 to warn Klarg.

Rock Dams. The goblins built simple dams to control the flow of water through the heart of the complex. If the goblin sentry in area 5 has called for the goblins here to release a flood, one or both of the pools are mostly empty and the stream is flowing unimpeded.

        <name>LMoP: CH - 8. Klarg’s Cave</name>
        <text>The leader of the goblinoids insists on keeping the bulk of the raiders&#39; stolen goods in his den. The Cragmaws&#39; plunder from the last month of raiding and ambushing caravans is here.

Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the south end of this large cave_ To the west, the floor slopes toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. A larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, the roar of falling water echoing from beyond. In the middle of the cavern, the coals ofa large fire smolder.

Klarg the bugbear shares this cave with his mangy pet wolf, Ripper, and two goblins. The bugbear is filled with delusions of grandeur and views himself as a mighty warlord just beginning his career of conquest. He is not entirely sane, referring to himself in the third person ("Who dares defy Klarg?" or "Klarg will build a throne
from your bones, puny ones!"). The goblins under his command resent his bullying.

Fire Pit. The hot coals in the central fire pit deal 1 fire damage to any creature that enters the fire pit, or 1d6 fire damage to any creature that falls prone there. A creature can take each type of damage only once per round.

Natural Chimney. A niche in the western wall forms the top of a shaft that descends 30 feet to area 3. See that area for information on climbing the natural chimney.

Supplies. The piles of sacks and crates can provide half cover to any creature fighting or hiding behind them. Most are marked with the image of a blue lion--the symbol of the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company with a warehouse and trading post in Phandalin. Hidden among the supplies is an unlocked treasure chest belonging to Klarg (see the "Treasure" section). Any character who searches the supplies finds the chest.

DEVELOPMENTS
If Klarg is warned by the goblins in area 7 that the hideout is under attack, he and his wolf hide behind stalagmites while the goblins take cover behind the piles of supplies, hoping to ambush the characters when they enter the cave. If Klarg and company are not warned about possible attackers, the characters have a good chance to surprise them. The easiest way for the characters to achieve this is to climb the chimney from area 3, since Klarg does not expect an attack from that direction. If the wolf is killed, the bugbear attempts to climb down the chimney to area 3 and flee the cave complex.

TREASURE
The captured stores are bulky, and the characters will need a wagon to transport them. If they return the supplies to the Lionshield Coster in Phandalin (see part 2, "Phandalin&#39;&#39;), they earn a reward of 50 gp and the friendship of Linene and her company.
In addition to the stolen provisions, Klarg has a treasure chest that contains 600 cp, 110 sp, two potions of healing, and ajade statuette of a frog with tiny golden orbs for eyes (40 gp). The frog statuette is small enough to fit in a pocket or pouch.</text>

	• You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
	• You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
	• You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.
	If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

          <text>You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn&#39;t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.
	If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.

          <name>Gold (gp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

          <text>Because a world without whisky is not a world worth playing. You can use this to realistically account for the weight of liquids for games where you want to add realism or RP flair.
A bottle of whisky would be a quantity of 3. 1 pint of liquid weighs rougly 1 pound. There are 4 pints in a gallon, so a quantity of four would fill a pitcher, jug, pot, or waterskin. Mugs, tankards, and flasks hold 1 pint. A glass bottle holds 1 1/2 pints.

          <text>The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet
above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor
in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.

          <text>This room appears to be a large storage cellar, exactly the sort of thing one might expect to find beneath an old manor. The Redbrands want to keep their base of operations hidden, so other than the barrels filled with fresh provisions, nothing in this room gives away their presence.

The barrels contain salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. Moving barrels around to thoroughly search them is a noisy activity that attracts the attention of the Redbrands in area 2.</text>

          <text>This rectangular reservoir is clean and filled with cold, fresh water. It is 10 feet deep with a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor (so that the bottom of the cistern is 8 feet below the floor). Drain pipes from the roof of the old manor above fill the cistern with water.

A waterproof satchel hangs from a submerged rope attached along the south wall of the cistern, about 2 feet below the surface of the water. It&#39;s not visible from above the water, but can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or automatically by a character probing the cistern with a pole or jumping in. The satchel contains some valuable items (see the "Treasure" section).</text>

          <text>No monsters or villains are found in this area, but the ruffians in area 2 take notice if the characters make a lot of noise here. They creep into the room, gaining surprise if the characters don&#39;t hear them (see "Surprise" in the rulebook). If the ruffians fight in this area and two are defeated, the last ruffian might reveal the secret door by fleeing in that direction.</text>

          <name>Gold (gp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

          <text>Well-made and extremely durable, this clothing is made to withstand the rigor and abuse of traveling and the occasional scuffle. Traveler&#39;s clothes are similar in style as common clothes but use heavier, more durable materials. Traveler&#39;s clothes also includes a common cloak and replaces common shoes with leather boots. They offer slightly better protection from the elements than common or fine clothes.

          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.

          <name>Gold (gp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

          <name>Spell Scroll (2nd Level) of Augury</name>
          <detail>uncommon</detail>
          <text>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written as a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class&#39;s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell&#39;s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.
	If the spell is on your class&#39;s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC is 12.  On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
	A spell cast from this scroll has a save DC of 13 and an attack bonus of +5.
	A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

          <text>Talon is a +1 longsword in a silver-chased scabbard. Its hilt is worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. It once belonged to a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk.
	
Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property — the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

        <name>LMoP: Welcome To Phandalin</name>
        <text>The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver&#39;s Pact. However, the same ore horde that sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.

In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold
and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains.

Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.

When the characters first arrive in Phandalin, read:

—————————————————————————
The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins-crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars-surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main
street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.

As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.

If Sildar Hallwinter is with the party, add:
—————————————————————————
Sildar seems much more at ease. “My friends," he says, "let us secure lodgings. I&#39;m told the local inn is very quaint."
—————————————————————————

Sildar&#39;s plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek. When his investigation hits a dead end, he sets up a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the "Town master&#39;s Hall" section).
During this part of the adventure, the characters can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See the "Town Description"section for details.) The town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other.

However, the characters arrive late in the day and can&#39;t get to more than one or two locations before it&#39;s time to seek lodgings for the night.

Some locales the characters should visit include the following:

Barthen&#39;s Provisions. If the characters have the wagonload of supplies from the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, they are meant to deliver it to this shop.

Lionshield Coster. If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.

Stonehill Inn. If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill appears to be the best available option.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Stonehill Inn</name>
        <text>—————————————————————————
In the center of town stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.
—————————————————————————

This modest inn has six rooms for rent (Sildar Hallwinter takes one). If the characters decide to stay here, see "Food, Drink, and Lodging" in the rulebook for pricing. (The characters&#39; other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.)

The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established.

Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the town, and that Harbin Wester, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.

Rumors. Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with a number of good leads to explore in and around town. NPCs present in the Stonehill

Inn and the rumors they pass on include:

Narth, an old farmer: "Sister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded and exhausted." (See the "Shrine of Luck" section for more information.)

Elsa, a gossipy barmaid: "Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer." (See the "Ederrnath Orchard" section for more information.)

Lanar, a miner: "Ore raiders have been seen on the
east end of Triboar Trail. The town master is looking for someone to run them off." (See the "Townrnaster&#39;s Hall" section for more information.)

Trilena, the innkeeper&#39;s wife: "Thcl Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to the Redbrands a ten day ago when they came by his shop and leered at his wife. The ruffians murdered him. Several townsfolk saw it happen. The Redbrands grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing too." (Unknown to Trilena and the other townsfolk, the Redbrands took Thel&#39;s wife and children to their secret hideout.)

Pip, Toblen&#39;s young son: "Qelline Alderleaf&#39;s son
Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but Redbrands almost caught him." (See the "Alderleaf Farm" section for more information.)

Freda, a weaver: "The Redbrands hassle every business in town, except for the Phandalin Miner&#39;s Exchange. They don&#39;t want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it." (See the "Phandalin Miner&#39;s Exchange" section for more information.)

These leads should point the characters toward opportunities for adventure in and around Phandalin. In addition, any NPC at the inn can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town-and that the ruffians are trouble.

        <name>LMoP: Barthen’s Provisions</name>
        <text>Barthen&#39;s is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. Its shelves stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen&#39;s does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. (For prices, see "Adventuring Gear" in the rulebook.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster (see that section).

The proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly manner. He employs a couple young clerks (Ander and Thistle) who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Barthen isn&#39;t around.
Delivering the Supplies. If the characters began play with the "Meet Me in Phandalin" adventure hook, their orders are to deliver the wagon of supplies to Barthen&#39;s. Barthen pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character) and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If the characters tell him of Gundren Rockseeker&#39;s capture, Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver&#39;s Pact in the nearby hills. If the party hasn&#39;t already learned details of the mine from Sildar Hallwinter, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can relate the information from the first two paragraphs of the "Background" section at the start of the adventure.

Barthen also mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town. Barthen hasn&#39;t seen them in a ten day and expects the brothers to return "any day now" to resupply. What Barthen doesn&#39;t know is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine. See part 4, the "Wave Echo Cave" section, for more information.

Barthen&#39;s News. If the characters ask Barthen how business is going, the shopkeeper tells them that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down local businesses and flouting the townmaster&#39;s authority. If the characters seem of a mind to do something about it, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Edermath Orchards</name>
        <text>Daran Edermath is a retired adventurer who lives in a tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard. A fit, silver- haired half-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.

Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.

Daran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it&#39;s time someone took a stand against the Redbrands&#39; leader, Glasstaff. Daran knows the Redbrands hang around the Sleeping Giant tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the main Redbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town. (See the "Tresendar Manor" section for more information.)

Quest: Old Owl Trouble. Daran has heard storiesfrom prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Wel!. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who&#39;s there and what they&#39;re up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see "Old Owl Well" (page 29).

JOINING THE ORDER OF THE GAUNTLET
If the party deals with the Redbrands and investigates Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Order of the Gauntlet. He speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the order, such as honor and vigilance. If a character agrees, Daran awards the person the title of Cheval!.

Hanging above the front door of this modest trading post is
a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted
Ion it.
————————————————————————-

This building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city ofYartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hard hit by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)

 The master of the Phandalin post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named Linene Graywind. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn&#39;t know who is responsible.

In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. (For prices, see "Adventuring Gear" in the rulebook.) Linene has a few scruples, however, and won&#39;t sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town. Among those with whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house.

Recovered Goods. If the characters return the stolen goods found in area 8 of the Cragmaw hideout (or if they left the goods but reveal where they can be found), Linene gives them a reward of 50 gp and promises to help the adventurers any way she can.

        <name>LMoP: Phandalin Miner’s Exchange</name>
        <text>The Miner&#39;s Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. There isn&#39;t any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.

The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named Halia Thornton.

In her attempts to establish the Miner&#39;s Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don&#39;t cross her.

Halia doesn&#39;t know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them. She suggests the goblin might know the location. She leverages this information to try to persuade the characters into helping her deal with the Redbrands.

Quest: Halia&#39;sJob Offer. If approached by characters
she believes she can control, Halia explains that the Redbrands are a problem. She tells how the ruffians loiter around the Sleeping Giant tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. She then offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, whom the outlaws call Glasstaff, and bring her any correspondence found in the leader&#39;s
quarters. Halia doesn&#39;t reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates she has ulterior motives for wanting the Redbrand leader dead.</text>

        <text>A wise female halfling of forty-five, Qelline Alderleaf is a pragmatic farmer who seems to know everything that goes on in town. She is a kind host, and is willing to let the characters stay in her hayloft if they don&#39;t want to stay at the Stonehill Inn.

Carp&#39;s Story. Qelline&#39;s son, Carp, is a spirited and precocious halfling lad of ten years. He is enchanted by the idea of being an adventurer and says that he was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of "big ugly bandits" came out of the tunnel when he was there, and met with a pair of Redbrands. They didn&#39;t see him, but it was close. Carp thinks that the bandits have a secret lair under the old manor house. He can take the characters to the tunnel or provide them with directions to the location. The tunnel leads to area 8in the Redbrand hideout.

Quest: Reidoth the Druid. Qelline is a longtime friend of a druid named Reidoth. If she figures out that the characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such as Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, she suggests that they visit Reidoth and ask for his help, "since there&#39;s not an inch of the land he doesn&#39;t know." She tells the characters that Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called Thundertree, just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The
ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and she provides directions so the characters can easily find the place. If the party pursues this quest, see "Ruins of Thundertree" (page 30).</text>

        <text>Phandalin&#39;s only temple is a small shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, goddess of luck and good fortune.

The shrine is in the care of a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a zealous young elf who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands. Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too strong. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.

Quest: The Banshee&#39;s Bargain. Recently, Garaele&#39;s superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission. They wanted her to persuade a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele sought out Agatha in her lair, but the creature did not appear for her. Garaele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, a jeweled silver comb, and persuade the creature to tell what she knows about the location a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who flatters Agatha&#39;s vanity might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of healing as payment for their efforts. If the party pursues this quest, see "Conyberry and Agatha&#39;s Lair" (page 28).

JOINING THE HARPERS
If the party helps Garaele learn the fate of Bowgentle&#39;s spell book, the elf privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Harpers. She speaks with those who exemplify the virtues of the network and possess a desire to enact positive change through information and secrecy. If a character agrees, Sister Garaele awards the individual the title of Watcher.</text>

        <text>————————————————————
The townmaster&#39;s hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched
wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. Posted on a board next to the front door is a notice written in Common. It reads: "REWARD-Orcs near Wyvern Tor! Those of a mind to face the orc menace should inquire within." The notice bears the town&#39;s seal and an indecipherable signature.
————————————————————

Phandalin has no functioning government, but the townsfolk elect someone to serve as town master each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps any records that need to be kept. The current town master is a male human banker named Harbin Wester-a fat, pompous old fool. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, he claims that they&#39;re "just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really."
The townmaster&#39;s hall has a small but serviceable jail in the cellar. The jail consists of two cells, and Harbin carries keys to the cell doors.

Quest: Ore Trouble. Harbin is looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where travelers have reported trouble with a band of orcs near Wyvern Tor. He offers 100 gp to any group that can take care of the problem. If the party pursues this quest, see "Wyvern Tor" (page 35).

Quest: Finding Cregmaw Castle. After resting at the Stonehill Inn, Sildar Hallwinter establishes himself at the townmaster&#39;s hall. As an agent of the Lords&#39; Alliance, his goal is to bring law and order to Phandalin. As such, he wants to find the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and help the Rockseeker brothers put it back into production, believing that bringing prosperity to the region will help civilize the town.

Sildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party
a 500 gp reward if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and de eat or drive off the tribe&#39;s chieftain. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the Triboar Trail for more raiding parties (see "Wilderness Encounters" in the "Triboar Trail" section of part 3).

Quest: Finding Iarno. After questioning several locals, Sildar learns that larno Albrek, a fellow member of the Lords&#39; Alliance, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back larno-or what&#39;s left of him, if something killed him. Sildar describes larno as "a short, dark- bearded human wizard in his thirties."

Unknown to Sildar, larno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the alias Glasstaff to conceal his identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about larno, Sildar expresses a desire to have the wizard captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno&#39;s fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Redbrand threat.

JOINING THE LORDS&#39; ALLIANCE
If the party eliminates the goblin threat from Cragmaw Castle or uncovers larno&#39;s treachery, Sildar Hallwinter privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Lords&#39; Alliance. He speaks with those who exemplify a desire for the security of civilization through action. If a character agrees, Sildar Hallwinter awards the individual the title of Cloak.

        <name>LMoP: Redbrand Ruffians</name>
        <text>Within a day or so of the adventurers&#39; arrival in Phandalin, a confrontation with the Redbrands becomes inevitable. This can happen in a number of different ways:

- After speaking with a number of NPCs in town, the characters decide to confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant tap house.
- The characters decide to investigate Tresendar Manor. Skip the encounter and go straight to "Redbrand Hideout."
- If the characters show no interest in the Redbrands, a gang of the ruffians seeks them out and picks a fight in street. Run this encounter as the characters are leaving one of the locations in the town.

CONFRONTATION
If the characters confront the Redbrands at the Sleeping Giant, read:

———————————————————————
The Sleeping Giant is a ramshackle taproom at the east end
of town. Four human ruffians linger on the covered porch, perched on empty ale barrels or leaning against the wall. They all wear grimy scarlet cloaks, their sullen stares fixed on you as you approach.

One of the thugs spits on the ground. "Well, well," he snarls. "Here&#39;s a whole pack of little puppies. What do you want, puppies? Come here to bark at us?"
———————————————————————

If the Redbrands confront the characters in the street, read:
As you head back into the street, you see four armed ruffians waiting for you. All of them are humans wearing grimy red cloaks, their hands on their weapons as they watch you.

———————————————————————
One of the ruffians spits on the ground. "Time for you to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff, and be on your way."
Continue the insults and baiting as long as you like. The Redbrands attack in a round or two if the characters
don&#39;t. Neither side is surprised, because it&#39;s obvious that a fight is brewing.

The group consists of four Redbrand ruffians. If three of them are defeated, the last one flees toward Tresendar Manor.

DEVELOPMENTS
Redbrands who are captured or charmed by the
characters can impart useful information. (See the "What the Redbrands Know" sidebar on page 20.) Townmaster Harbin Wester won&#39;t want to keep Redbrand prisoners until he knows the whole gang has been defeated, but the characters can easily persuade or intimidate him into locking up any prisoners they capture for at
least a few days.

If the characters kill the ruffians, most members of the town are grateful. One exception is the town master, who fears Redbrand retaliation. Harbin doesn&#39;t punish the characters but warns them not to cause trouble.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Redbrand Hideout</name>
        <text>The Redbrands&#39; base in Phandalin is a dungeon complex under Tresendar Manor. Before the manor was ruined, its cellars served as safe storage for food and water in the event that the estate was attacked, while an adjoining crypt provided a resting place for the deceased members of the Tresendar family. The Redbrands have since expanded the cellars to suit their own purposes, adding slave pens, workshops, and barracks.

If the characters begin their search at Tresendar Manor, they enter the dungeon in area 1. If they instead follow Carp Alderleaf to the secret tunnel the lad found, they enter the dungeon by way of area 8.

GENERAL FEATURES
The hideout consists of well-built dungeon chambers with flagstone floors and walls of dressed stone blocks. The western end of the complex is lower than the eastern end, with stairs leading down as the characters explore.

Ceilings. Passages and chambers are 10 feet high unless otherwise indicated.

Doors. All doors are made of wood with iron handles, hinges, and built-in locks. They are unlocked unless the text states otherwise. Iarno Albrek (area 12) and a bugbear named Mosk (area 9) each carry an iron key that can lock or unlock every door in the complex.
A locked door can be picked with thieves&#39; tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. A door can also be broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

Secret Doors. An "S" on the Redbrand Hideout map indicates the location of a secret door.
Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. Spotting a secret door from a distance of no more than 10 feet without actively searching for it requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher, whereas a character who takes the time to search the wall can find the secret door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Secret doors swing open on hidden iron hinges and are not locked.

Light. Most areas are brightly lit by oil lamps in wall sconces, refilled every few hours as needed.

        <text>WHAT THE REDBRANDS KNOW
If the characters charm or successfully question any of the
Redbrands, they can learn the location of their hideout under Tresendar Manor as well as the following useful information:

The leader of the Redbrands is a human wizard known as Glasstaff, so named because his magic staff is made of glass. (Only larno Albrek and the Black Spider know Glasstaff&#39;s real name.) Glasstaff&#39;s chambers are in the western end of the stronghold (see areas 11 and 12).

A mysterious figure called the Black Spider has hired the Redbrands to frighten off adventurers and intimidate the locals, for reasons unknown.

The Black Spider has sent bugbears to reinforce the Redbrands and provide extra muscle (see area 9).

The lower part of the complex is guarded by a hideous "eye monster" (see area 8).

The Redbrands have a handful of captives in a holding area "near the old crypts," which are guarded by skeletons (see areas 4 and 5).</text>

        <name>LMoP: RH - 1. Cellar</name>
        <text>Any exploration of the manor grounds finds it deserted, but with plenty of tracks leading to a stone staircase just off the empty ruin of a large kitchen. At the bottom of the stairs stands an unlocked door with a cellar beyond.

When the characters open the door, read the following:
————-————-————-—————————-
The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet
above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor
in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.
————-————-————-—————————-

This room appears to be a large storage cellar, exactly the sort of thing one might expect to find beneath an old manor. The Redbrands want to keep their base of operations hidden, so other than the barrels filled with fresh provisions, nothing in this room gives away their presence.

The barrels contain salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. Moving barrels around to thoroughly search them is a noisy activity that attracts the attention of the Redbrands in area 2.

Cistern. This rectangular reservoir is clean and filled with cold, fresh water. It is 10 feet deep with a rim 2 feet higher than the surrounding floor (so that the bottom of the cistern is 8 feet below the floor). Drain pipes from the roof of the old manor above fill the cistern with water.

A waterproof satchel hangs from a submerged rope attached along the south wall of the cistern, about 2 feet below the surface of the water. It&#39;s not visible from above the water, but can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or automatically by a character probing the cistern with a pole or jumping in. The satchel contains some valuable items (see the "Treasure" section).

Secret Door. A secret door is located in the southwest corner of the room. See the "General Features" section for more information on secret doors.

DEVELOPMENTS
No monsters or villains are found in this area, but the ruffians in area 2 take notice if the characters make a lot of noise here. They creep into the room, gaining surprise if the characters don&#39;t hear them (see "Surprise" in the rulebook). If the ruffians fight in this area and two are defeated, the last ruffian might reveal the secret door by fleeing in that direction.

TREASURE
The satchel hidden in the cistern is waterproof and contains a potion of healing, a potion of invisibility, 50 gp, and a clean set of ordinary travel clothing. This is a getaway kit that Iarno keeps here in case of an emerge</text>

        <text>Most of the Redbrands&#39; human members have lodgings in Phandalin. This barracks is a good place to lie low after shaking down local miners and fur traders.

—————————————————————————
This appears to be a storeroom pressed into service as living quarters. Two double bunks stand against the wall near the door, while barrels and crates fill the southern half of the chamber.
—————————————————————————

Three Redbrand ruffians are resting in this room. If they hear a good deal of noise in area 1 (including loud voices or barrels being rolled around), they prepare themselves for a fight and try to surprise intruders.

The barrels here contain similar provisions to those in area 1.

TREASURE
All three Redbrands wear belt pouches holding treasure. The first holds 16 sp and 7 gp; the second, 12 sp and 5 gp; and the third, 15 ep and two garnets (10 gp each). Additionally, three dirty scarlet cloaks hang from the bunks.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 300 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the ruffians.

        <name>LMoP: RH - 3. Trapped Hall (100xp)</name>
        <text>This area was part of Tresendar Manor&#39;s original cellars. The Redbrands dug out the dirt beneath the stone floor, creating a hidden pit trap.

—————————————————————————
Thick dust covers the flagstones of this somber hallway. The walls are decorated with faux columns every ten feet, and the double doors at the west end of the hall are sheathed in copper plate, now green with age. A relief carving of a mournful angel graces the doors.
—————————————————————————

The pit trap in the middle of the hallway is hidden under
a false floor consisting of loose stone tiles laid atop breakaway timbers. The tiles and timbers collapse under 100 or more pounds of weight. A character searching the hall for traps can spot the covered pit with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. A successful check also reveals narrow ledges on the north and south sides of the pit. A creature attempting to skirt around the pit using one of these ledges must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

A creature that triggers the trap or fails the Dexterity check to skirt around the edge of the pit must attempt a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to catch the edge. On a failed save, the creature falls 20 feet to the dirt floor of the pit, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 100 XP equally among the characters if the party avoids or survives the pit trap.</text>

        <name>LMoP: RH - 4. Tresendar Crypts</name>
        <text>The elders of the long-gone Tresendar family were once laid to rest in this mausoleum.

Three large stone sarcophagi stand within this dusty crypt, and propped up against each sarcophagus is a human skeleton clad in bits of rusty mail. False columns along the walls are carved in the image of spreading oak trees. The double doors in the southeast corner are sheathed in tarnished copper plate.

The three skeletons are animated and attack any creature that comes within 10 feet of the door leading to area 5 or the door leading to area 6, unless that creature is wearing the scarlet cloak of the Redbrands or speaks the password "Illefam" (the name of an ancient elven nation, which once spread across much of the Sword Coast).

The stone lid of each sarcophagus is carved to depict the person entombed within-two human males and one human female, all of noble bearing. If opened, the tombs contain mostly moldering bones and scraps of clothing, but see the "Treasure" section.

DEVELOPMENTS
Fighting in this room alerts the Redbrands in area 5 that trouble is on the way.

TREASURE
Amid the bones in each sarcophagus is a platinum signet ring (50 gp).

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS

        <name>LMoP: RH - 5. Slave Pens</name>
        <text>For the past two months, the Redbrands have been capturing travelers in the area and holding them in these pens until they can be sold into slavery.

This long room is partitioned into three areas, with iron bars walling off the north and south. Filthy straw lines the floors of those cells, the hinged doors of which are secured by chains and padlocks. A pair of disheveled human women are held in the cell to the south, while a human boy is confined to the north. All are dressed in plain gray tunics and have iron collars fitted around their necks.

A heap of discarded clothing is piled carelessly against the far wall.

Two Redbrand ruffians in scarlet cloaks stand guard here, though they spend most of their time taunting the hapless prisoners (see the "Captives" section). If they hear fighting in area 5, they take up positions against the wall near the door, then try to surprise intruders. The captives are too intimidated to shout warnings or call for help.

The heap of clothing belongs to the various captives who have been housed here over the last two months-at a dozen people to judge by the size of the pile.

The cell doors feature simple locks requiring thieves&#39; tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check to pick. The doors can also be wrenched open by brute force with a successful DC 22 Strength check.

CAPTIVES
The three human commoners imprisoned here are Mirna Dendrar and her two teenage children, thirteen-year-old Nars and eighteen-year-old Nilsa. A few days ago, the Redbrands murdered Mirna&#39;s husband, Thel, for defying them. (His corpse can be found in area 8.) That night, the gang returned and abducted the family from their home in Phandalin. The gang plans to sell the family into slavery.

The Dendrars are grateful to the characters for rescuing them, but they can&#39;t provide much information about the Redbrand hideout. All they know is that the boss is a wizard (though they haven&#39;t met him and don&#39;t know his name), and that he has "tall, furry monsters with big ears" (bugbears) working for him.

Side Quest: Mirna&#39;s Heirloom. Though her family has nothing to offer as a reward, Mirna tells the characters that she might know where a valuable heirloom is hidden. When she was a young girl, she and her family fled from the town of Thundertree after undead overran the place. Her family had an herb and alchemy shop, inside which a case containing an emerald necklace was hidden beneath a section of storage shelves. She never dared to return and retrieve it. The shop was in the southeast part of Thundertree. If the characters decide to explore the ruins of Thundertree, see part 3 of the adventure.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the ruffians. Divide 100 XP equally among the characters if the Dendrars make it back to town alive.</text>

        <name>LMoP: RH - 6. Armory</name>
        <text>The door to this room is locked from the outside. Across from the locked door is a secret door that leads to area 7. For more information on locked doors and secret doors, see the "General Features" section (page 20).

Racks of weapons line the walls of this chamber, including
spears, swords, crossbows, and bolts. Adozen dirty red
cloaks hang from hooks by the door. 1

The Redbrands have ambitious plans to expand their numbers in the near future, so they have been stockpiling arms and armor.
The weapon racks hold twelve spears, six shortswords, four longswords, six light crossbows, and eight quivers holding twenty crossbow bolts each.</text>

        <name>LMoP: RH - 7. Storeroom and Work Area</name>
        <text>In this chamber, the Redbrands take stock of their stolen wares, either shipping them out through the cavern to the south or packaging them for storage in the stronghold.

——————————————————————-
This area is the north end of a large natural cavern, but it has been finished with dressed stone block walls and a flagstone floor. Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with a number of empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails.
——————————————————————-

The cavern continues for some distance to the south. You can make out several passages that open up off the larger cavern, and what looks like a deep pit or crevasse in the floor.

This room contains two secret doors, one leading to area 6 and the other to area 12. See the "General Features" section (page 20) for more information on secret doors.

TREASURE
Most of the provisions and goods here aren&#39;t valuable, but lying among them are thirty beaver pelts (2 gp each). They were looted from a caravan on the Triboar Trail a few days ago.</text>

      <note>
        <name>LMoP: RH - 8. Crevasse</name>
        <text>The characters arrive here by one of three routes: the tunnel from area 1, the storeroom at area 7, or the rough- hewn passage to the south, which continues off the map for about one hundred feet and emerges from a tunnel in the woods south of Tresendar Manor. The passage is an excellent way to smuggle people or goods in and out of Phandalin without being seen, and is thus perfect for a gang of slavers and thieves.

—————————————————————————
A cold breeze fills this large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh. A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty-foot-high ceiling. Two arched wooden bridges span
the chasm.
—————————————————————————

The guardian of this cave is a nothic-an insane subterranean monster that hungers for flesh. The creature, lured by a faint magical effect emanating from the crevasse, was occupying the area when the Redbrands moved in. Iarno managed to strike a bargain with the monster, convincing it to help guard the stronghold in exchange for treasure and the occasional gift of fresh meat. Still, the nothic is untrustworthy.

The nothic lurks near the west ends of the two bridges. If it notices intruders entering the cave, it hides behind one of the large stone columns and watches them, attempting to use its Weird Insight (see the creature&#39;s stat block) to discern the characters&#39; secrets.

The nothic communicates using telepathy. If detected, it prefers to negotiate and isn&#39;t above betraying the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food. When roleplaying the nothic, consider speaking in whispers and throwing in some mad cackles and bits of gibberish. Also be sure to mention that the creature isn&#39;t actually talking but rather filling the characters&#39; heads with its foul murmurings and demands for food. The nothic knows everything the Redbrands know; see the "What the Redbrands Know" sidebar on page 20

Bridges. These bridges are made of wooden planks and have no rails. The south one is rigged to collapse when a creature weighing more than 50 pounds moves across it. A character next to the bridge can discern that the construction is faulty with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any creature can use an action to dislodge one end of either bridge, dropping it into
the crevasse.

Crevasse. This steep-sided fissure is 5 to 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep. Its rough walls are easily climbed without an ability check. A creature that falls into the crevasse takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone in a jumble of rubble that is difficult terrain (see "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook).

The bottom of the crevasse feels unnaturally cold. When viewed with a detect magic spell, the area emanates a faint necromantic aura. The magic causes all organic matter in the crevasse to age and decompose at half the normal rate. Currently heaped at the bottom among broken and well- gnawed bones is the half-eaten body of Thel Dendrar, the woodcarver of Phandalin who was murdered by the Redbrands. The outlaws left his corpse here for the nothic to feed on.

TREASURE
The nothic keeps its hoard in a battered wooden chest hidden in a cubbyhole at the bottom of the crevasse, under the north bridge. The chest can&#39;t be seen from the edge of the crevasse, but is obvious to any character who descends into the fissure. The chest contains 160 sp, 120 gp, five malachite gems (15 gp each), two potions of healing, and a scroll of augury. The chest also holds a +l longsword in a silver-chased scabbard. The sword is inscribed with the name "Talon," and its hilt is worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. It once belonged to a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the sword and recalls this lore.

Sir Aldith died fighting off the ores that attacked through the hidden caverns below his manor. Talon was lost here until the nothic found it.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 450 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the nothic or negotiates a truce with it.

        <name>LMoP: RH - 9. Guard Barracks</name>
        <text>A character who listens at this door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears several gruff voices issuing demeaning commands in the Goblin tongue. Examples include "Lick the floor!" and "Roll like a dog!" The bugbears here are bullying their goblin slave.

This barracks contains four roughly built wooden bunks, with heaped-up blankets and dirty dishes scattered about. A strong smell of unwashed bodies and rotten meat fills the air. Three tall, furry humanoids are lounging among the mess, barking orders at a sad little goblin that demeans itself for their amusement. Your sudden appearance causes the goblin to faint.

Three bugbears and one goblin are present. The goblin, Droop, falls unconscious at the sight of the party, but another creature can use an action to wake him. Otherwise, Droop remains unconscious for 1d10 minutes.

The bugbears work for the Black Spider and were sent here to help Iarno keep the Redbrands and the citizens of Phandalin in line. The leader is named Mosk. He wears a jeweled eye patch even though he has both his eyes. Mosk wears the eye patch because he thinks it&#39;s fancy.

The bugbears avoid the human members of the Redbrands. If the characters are wearing scarlet cloaks taken from elsewhere, the bugbears assume that they serve Iarno. Clever characters might even persuade the bugbears to help deal with "traitors" or "impostors" elsewhere in the dungeon. If you don&#39;t think the players are doing a great job roleplaying the deception, you can have the character who is doing most of the talking make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to convince the bugbears to do what the party wants.

DEVELOPMENTS
The bugbears are the only ones in the Redbrand hideout who know the location of Wave Echo Cave. They won&#39;t willingly divulge this information, since they fear the Black Spider more than they fear the characters.

The bugbears also know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but again, they don&#39;t share this information readily. A character who interrogates a captured bugbear can pry the information loose with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check.

TREASURE
Mosk carries a belt pouch containing 33 sp and wears an eye patch made of black leather set with semiprecious stones (50 gp). He also has an iron key that locks and unlocks all the doors in the Redbrand hideout.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 600 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the bugbears.

        <name>LMoP: RH - 10. Common Room</name>
        <text>This area serves as the headquarters and meeting room for the Redbrands. When there is no official business to discuss, it doubles as a common room where the stronghold guards can relax while off duty.

A character who listens at the door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears the villains within engaged in a game of knucklebones. This makes for a mysterious rattling sound, followed by shouts and groans and a sudden gabble of voices as wagers are paid. If the characters burst into the room, they automatically surprise its occupants.

—————————————————————————
Several worn tables and chairs are scattered around this large room. Wooden benches are drawn up against walls decorated with draperies of brown and red, and several ale kegs are propped up and tapped.

Four tough-looking human warriors wearing scarlet cloaks are gathered around one of the tables. A stack of coins and trinkets is heaped upon the tabletop between them.
—————————————————————————

Four Redbrand ruffians are drinking and playing knucklebones when the characters enter. The game isn&#39;t far from turning acrimonious, as most of them do. The dice are loaded, and the ruffian to which they belong is naturally winning. All four have been drinking heavily, and they are poisoned (see the appendix in the rule book for the effects of being poisoned).

The Redbrands immediately recognize characters wearing scarlet cloaks as impostors. However, fast- talking characters might still be able to pass themselves off as "new recruits," especially if they offer to join the game. If you don&#39;t think the players are doing a great job roleplaying the deception, you can have the character
who is doing most of the talking make a DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check to fool the Redbrands.

TREASURE
The wealth in the room is all on the table, having been bet in the game. (Knocking over the table or mixing up all the enemies&#39; loot is a great way to distract them for a short time.) The total amounts to 75 cp, 55 sp, 22 ep, 15 gp, and a gold earring set with a tiny ruby (30 gp).

        <name>LMoP: RH - 11. Wizard’s Workshop</name>
        <text>Faint bubbling and dripping sounds can be heard through either door of this room with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

This room appears to be a wizard&#39;s workshop. A rat scurries across the floor and takes refuge under a large worktable set up with alembics, retorts, distillation coils, and other alchemical devices, all of it stewing and bubbling away. Bookshelves are crowded with sheaves of parchment and strange-looking tomes.

larno has left his rat familiar here to watch for intruders. The rat shares a telepathic bond with its master, and it sends a brief warning message to larno as soon as it detects intruders. The rat moves at a speed of 20 feet and has AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. If the rat is killed, it disappears.

If the characters leave the rat unharmed, it follows them around as though curious or hungry. It might even feign affection for a character who feeds it, though it remains absolutely loyal to Iarno,
Books and Notes. larno is trying to master the art of brewing potions and concocting alchemical mixtures. The books and notes scattered around the room are basic texts on alchemy. Any character proficient in Arcana can see that larno&#39;s apparatus appears to be set up to brew potions of invisibility-not that he has succeeded so far.

Among the books is a tome written in Dwarvish. The journal of an adventurer named Urmon, it describes the history of the Lost Mine of Phandelver and the Forge of Spells. (Share the information in the first and second paragraph of the "Background" section if you have not already done so.) In addition, Urmon records that a magic mace named Lightbritiger was commissioned by priests of Lathander, the god of dawn, from the rnages working with the gnomes and dwarves of the Phandelver&#39;s Pact. The mace was lost when Wave Echo Cave and its mine vanished from history. (Characters might find the mace in part 4, "Wave Echo Cave.")

DEVELOPMENTS
Because larno and his rat familiar share a telepathic bond, the mage (in area 12) knows the characters are coming and has time to prepare for them.

TREASURE
Most of the materials in this room have no value, but three small bottles hold rare reagents: mercury, dragon bile, and powdered nightshade. These are worth 25 gp each to an apothecary or alchemist.</text>

        <name>LMoP: RH - Glasstaff’s Quarters</name>
        <text>If the characters approach this room through the secret passage from area 7, they can surprise the leader of the Redbrands-Iarno "Glasstaff" Albrek. Otherwise, his rat familiar warns him of any who approach through area 11, and he flees before the characters arrive.

—————————————————————————
The walls of this bedchamber are covered with drapes of scarlet cloth. The furnishings include a small writing desk with matching chair, a comfortable-looking bed, and a wooden chest at the foot of the bed.
—————————————————————————

If larno is surprised, add the following paragraph:

—————————————————————————
Sitting at the desk is a short, dark-bearded human male in robes, studying a tome. He wears a princely mantle of ermine. A beautiful glass staff leans against his chair, within easy reach.
—————————————————————————

If the rat in area 11 warns him that trouble is approaching, larno the evil mage grabs his staff of defense (see appendix A) and the scrolls in his chest (see the "Treasure" section), and flees through the secret door in the northeast corner of the room. In his haste, larno leaves behind a letter from the Black Spider (see the "Developments" section) and neglects to make sure the secret door is closed all the way. Characters gain advantage on ability checks made to find the slightly ajar secret door (see "Advantage and Disadvantage" in the rulebook). For more information on secret doors, see the "General Features" section (page 20).

If he manages to escape, larno flees to area 1 (through areas 7 and 8) and grabs the satchel hidden in the cistern there. If the nothic is still alive in area 8, larno instructs it to waylay any pursuers. If the characters catch up to him, larno quaffs the potion of invisibility in the satchel and flees the hideout. At your discretion, he could reappear later in the adventure.

DEVELOPMENTS
Various papers and notes are stacked neatly on the desk, mostly consisting of larno&#39;s written orders to apothecaries and alchemists in nearby settlements for more materials for his workshop. The characters also find a letter signed with the Black Spider&#39;s symbol.

If larno is taken into custody, Sildar Hallwinter arranges to have the wizard incarcerated in the townmaster&#39;s hall until he can be safely transported back to Neverwinter. Whether larno stands trial for his crimes is beyond the scope of this adventure. The Black Spider is too preoccupied to meddle in the wizard&#39;s fate.

TREASURE
At the foot of Iarno&#39;s bed is a sturdy, unlocked wooden chest holding the best pickings of the Redbrands&#39; loot over the last two months. It contains 180 sp, 130 gp, and a silk pouch containing five carnelians (10 gp each), two peridots (15 gp each), and one pearl (100 gp). It also contains two magic items that larno brought with him from Neverwinter: a scroll of charm person and a scroll of fireball.

larno also wields a staff of defense (see appendix A).

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party slays larno Albrek. Double the XP award if they capture larno and deliver him to Sildar Hallwinter in Phandalin </text>

• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can&#39;t take actions or reactions, and can&#39;t move or speak.
	
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	
• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

          <text>You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.
	
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
	
Charmed:
• A charmed creature can&#39;t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	
• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

          <text>Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
	A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
	When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
	
Restrained:
• A restrained creature&#39;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have disadvantage.
	
• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

	• You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
	• You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
	• You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
	• You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&#39;t pushed.
	In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell&#39;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

          <text>By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue ray, or a bird. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard or a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat. You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell towards the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger or 25 miles for other animals.
	When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn&#39;t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes it way back to where you cast this spell.
	
At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

          <name>Silver (sp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

          <detail>uncommon</detail>
          <text>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written as a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class&#39;s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell&#39;s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.
	If the spell is on your class&#39;s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC is 12.  On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
	A spell cast from this scroll has a save DC of 13 and an attack bonus of +5.
	A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

          <name>Gold (gp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

Hit: 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
	
Paralyzed:
• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can&#39;t take actions or reactions, and can&#39;t move or speak.
	
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	
• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
	
Poisoned:
• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>

          <name>Gold (gp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

          <text>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written as a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class&#39;s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell&#39;s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.
	If the spell is on your class&#39;s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC is 12.  On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
	A spell cast from this scroll has a save DC of 13 and an attack bonus of +5.
	A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

          <name>Gold (gp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

          <name>Gold (gp)</name>
          <text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
	With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#39;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
	One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#39;s work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#39;s rest in a poor inn.
	One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
	In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
	A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

        <name>LMoP: Part 3 - The Spider’s Web</name>
        <text>In this part of the adventure, the characters follow up on existing leads and lines of inquiry. They can&#39;t learn much more in Phandalin, so they need to set out into the forests and hills surrounding the town to uncover the larger plots they are caught up in. The characters are not required to visit all the locations in this section.
Depending on which NPCs the characters met and which quests or clues they picked up, some or all the following information might be known to them:

Sister Garaele wants the characters to seek out the banshee Agatha in the ruined town of Conybery and ask her about Bowgentle&#39;s spellbook.

Daran Edermath wants the characters to find out who is lurking near the ruins at Old Owl Well.

Qelline Alderleaf has suggested that the characters go to the ruined town of Thundertree and consult with the druid Reidoth, who might know the whereabouts of Cragmaw Castle, Wave Echo Cave, or both.

Townmaster Harbin Wester wants the characters to seek out an ore encampment near Wyvern Tor and chase the ores away from the area.

Sildar Hallwinter wants the characters to find Cragmaw Castle, search for Gundren Rockseeker, rescue the dwarf, and retrieve his map.

Each of these possible quests has its own section in this part of the adventure. The characters can remain in Phandalin long enough to rest up and purchase supplies. When they&#39;re done, have them pick a storyline to investigate, then set out for the appropriate destination.

        <name>LMoP: Triboar Trail</name>
        <text>Phandalin lies in a part of the North known as "the Triboar Trail," "the Triboar Cutoff," or "the Cony Gap." This stretch of foothills and rolling, sparsely wooded plains extends between the Sword Mountains to the south and Neverwinter Wood to the north. The area gains its name from an old trail that runs from the distant town of Triboar to the east, winding westward about one hundred miles through the abandoned village of Conyberry, then running north of Phandalin on its way to the High Road along the coast.

Describe the party&#39;s overland travels as vividly as you like, but keep the story moving. "You walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest" is far less evocative and memorable than, "Alight rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but otherwise you see nothing out of the ordinary."

During this part of the adventure, the characters will frequently be marching overland from one point of interest to another. As can be seen on the regional map on page 5, some of these areas are a good forty to fifty miles apart, requiring several days of marching overland to travel to the next adventure site.

Travel Time. Assume that the party travels twenty-four miles per day over a period of ten hours. The characters must rest for eight hours per day, with the remaining six hours consisting of making and breaking camp, preparing meals, and a little bit of foraging or hunting as the opportunity permits.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Conyberry And Agatha’s Lair</name>
        <text>The town of Conyberry was sacked by barbarians years ago and now lies in ruins. The Triboar Trail runs right through the abandoned town, providing an easy landmark for locating the lair of the banshee Agatha. From the ruins of Conyberry, an old trail leads northwest into Neverwinter Wood. Agatha&#39;s lair is a few miles outside town.

—————————————————————————
The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss drape the branches, and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. Rounding a bend in the trail, you see a screen made from the warped branches of trees standing close together, woven into a domelike shelter in the shadows. A low doorway leads inside.
—————————————————————————

If the characters exercise caution and remember what they&#39;ve come for, they will be able to speak with the banshee. When the characters enter the shelter, read the following:

—————————————————————————
A home of sorts is sheltered within the dome of woven
branches. It is sparsely furnished with chests, shelves, a
table, and a reclined couch, all of it old and of elven craft.
—————————————————————————

Agatha senses the characters&#39; intrusion and manifests shortly after they enter her home.

—————————————————————————
The air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you. A cold, pale light flickers in the air, rapidly taking on the form of a female elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind. She might have been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features now. "Foolish mortals," she snarls. "What do you want here? Do you not know it is death to seek me.
—————————————————————————

If the characters are rude, disrespectful, or threatening, Agatha scowls and disappears. She does not attack them, nor does she return if the characters call out to her.

DEALING WITH AGATHA
If the characters are respectful and polite, Agatha can be persuaded to help them with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The player whose character takes the lead in speaking with the banshee makes the check. If that player role plays the encounter well, allow him or her to make the check with advantage. If any character has Sister Garaele&#39;s silver comb and presents it to Agatha as a gift, the check is automatically successful.

—————————————————————————
The ghostly figure smiles with cold amusement. "Very well,"
she says. "I know that you seek many things. Ask me one
question, and I will give you an answer."
—————————————————————————

If the characters ask about Bowgentle&#39;s spellbook, Agatha tells them that she traded the book to a necromancer
named Tsernoth from the city of Iriaebor more than a hundred years ago. She does not know what became of the book afterward. Her answer is truthful, and it is all the information Sister Garaele needs for the Harpers to resume their search.

The characters might instead choose to ask Agatha about something else-for example, the location of Cragmaw Castle, the location of Wave Echo Cave, the identity of the Black Spider, or Hamun Kost&#39;s question about Old Owl Well (see that section). Agatha is well informed and a capable diviner, so she can answer almost any single question pertaining to the adventure that the characters think to ask. However, the banshee answers only one question, so the characters should choose
it carefully.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
The characters gain experience for successfully
persuading Agatha to answer a question. If they do, divide 200 XP equally among the characters.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Old Owl Well</name>
        <text>Built thousands of years ago by a long-vanished empire, Old Owl Well is a ruined watchtower that now consists of little more than a few crumbling walls and the broken stump of a tower. In the tower&#39;s courtyard stands an old well that still delivers clean, fresh water. Old Owl Well lies in the wild and rugged hills south of the Triboar Trail. The site is relatively easy to find, and any NPC in Phandalin
can provide directions to the ruins.

Recently, prospectors in the area have noted that someone has set up a campsite at Old Owl Well, and that undead guardians have been posted to keep intruders out.

—————————————————————————
As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbling ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills. The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard of sorts, adjacent to the broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tent has been set up in the middle of the courtyard, but no one is in sight.
—————————————————————————

The ruins are currently occupied by a mage who is busy exploring the site in the hope of gleaning arcane lore left behind by its builders. The characters can enter the site from any direction, either following old footpaths or scrambling up the slope and finding a gap in the surrounding walls of rubble.

Twelve zombies lurk inside the crumbled shell of the old watchtower and can&#39;t be seen from outside. However, any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or higher smells a deathly odor wafting from the tower&#39;s direction. When characters approach the tower or the tent, the zombies shamble out of the tower.

If a battle erupts, Hamun Kost, the evil rnage, emerges from his tent and asks, "What is the meaning of this?"

Kost is a stout, red-robed figure with sallow skin, a shaved scalp, and a black tattoo on his forehead. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes Kost&#39;s tattoo as a necromantic symbol.

A successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check verifies the garb as that usual for Thay, a land far to the east where wizards pattern their flesh with tattoos. The tattoo on the head represents a wizard&#39;s school of magic. Kost&#39;s school is necromancy.

If any character attempts to talk to Kost, even by calling out a greeting or answering his questions during combat, he temporarily calls off his zombies. The Red Wizard is not particularly aggressive, and he is willing to strike a deal that advances his interests at the same time it helps the characters.

Kost stays tight-lipped about the reason for his
presence in the region. He is, however, willing to provide information the party needs if it does a favor for him. If the characters give Kost some indication of what they want, he shares one or both of these requests:

He wants the ores at Wyvern Tor removed, since they have scouted out his camp and seem inclined to cause trouble.

He wants to ask a question of Agatha the banshee:
"What is the name of the wizard who built the tower at Old Owl Well?" Kost won&#39;t risk the banshee&#39;s anger, but the characters could ask the question for him. (Agatha knows the name: Arthindol.)

TREASURE
Hamun Kost&#39;s tent contains a comfortable traveling suite, including a cot, a chair, a writing desk, supplies, and a chest of clothes. In the chest is a leather bag containing 35 sp, 20 ep, 20 gp, 5 pp, one pearl (100 gp), a potion of healing, a scroll of darkness in a bone tube, and a tiny jeweled box (25 gp) containing a ring of protection from ancient Netheril, the Red Wizard&#39;s most interesting discovery so far.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Learning about the Red Wizard&#39;s presence at Old Owl Well completes a quest given to the party by Daran Edermath in Phandalin. Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party parleys with Hamun Kost and reports back to Daran.

Divide 800 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats Hamun Kost and his zombies.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Ruins Of Thundertree </name>
        <text>Near the place where the Neverwinter River emerges from Neverwinter Wood stands the abandoned village of Thundertree. Once, this was a prosperous community on the outskirts of the forest, wealthy from the work of its woodcutters and trappers. Then thirty years ago, the eruption of Mount Hotenow to the north devastated Thundertree. In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.

Though most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms.

Few people dare to venture into the ruined village
now, and those who do so seldom stay long-with two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see area 4) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Cultists have also arrived recently (see area 13) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain (see area 7).

As the party approaches the ruins, read the following:

—————————————————————————
Gradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush. Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins with interiors open to the weather. Other buildings appear more or less intact. The whole place is eerily silent.

A wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads: "DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!"
—————————————————————————

Reidoth placed the sign to discourage bands of treasure seekers from stirring up the monsters in the area.

Many of Thundertree&#39;s buildings have crumbled in the years since the town was abandoned, even as nature threatens to swallow what remains.

Buildings. A building in Thundertree intact, as shown on the map.

Ruined buildings are empty shells with stone walls 5 to 8 feet high. Their roofs are gone, leaving piles of debris inside the walls. The debris is difficult terrain (see "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook).
Intact buildings are rundown, ramshackle stone cottages that are otherwise still standing. Their wooden doors are swollen and require a successful DC 10 Strength check to force open. The windows of any intact building are 2 feet wide and covered by wooden shutters containing 6-inch wide arrow slits. Creatures on one side of an arrow slit gain three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side (see "Cover" in the rulebook). Dusty old furnishings such as simple wooden chairs and tables remain in most intact buildings.

Trees and Brush. Trees average 30 to 40 feet tall and provide cover. Brush consists of large bushes that count as difficult terrain.

Cowering in the shadow o~ an old tree is a crumbled stone cottage with no roof. Weeds are rampant here.
—————————————————————————

Two twig blights hide among the weeds that flank the cottage&#39;s open doorway. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the blights, and compare the result to the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine if the blights are spotted.

The blights do not attack on their own (except in self- defense) but quickly come to the aid of the twig blights in area 2 if combat erupts there.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 50 XP equally among the characters if the party destroys the twig blights.

        <name>LMoP: RT - 2. Blighted Cottages</name>
        <text>Wind and weather have done their work here, and little remains of these houses or their former contents.

—————————————————————————
These ruined, side-by-side cottages look as though they might have been the homes of prosperous shopkeepers or well-off farmers in their time. All that remains are collapsed walls
and piles of debris. Several young trees have grown up in the midst of the ruins.
—————————————————————————

The overgrowth conceals a deadly threat-six twig blights lurking among the ordinary foliage. Spotting them requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check challenged by the blights&#39; Dexterity (Stealth) check.

These plant monsters are hungry and fight until destroyed. One round after they attack, the twig blights in area 1join the fray.

TREASURE
A merchant who once lived here had a chest full of coins hidden under the flagstone floor of his home. A thorough search of the interior of the eastern cottage and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the old chest among the roots of the tree growing up through the house. The chest contains 700 cp, 160 sp, and 90 gp.

        <text>This was formerly the Brown Horse, a tavern renowned for its excellent ale.

—————————————————————————
A weathered signboard by the door of this large building shows the faded image of a workhorse holding a flagon of ale. The building is sagging and dilapidated, but it is more intact than the ruins across the road.
—————————————————————————

Four ash zombies (see the "Ash Zombies" sidebar) lurk in the shadows in this building, slumped against the walls or under the bar. When living creatures enter, the zombies groan and stir, slowly climbing to their feet (spending half their speed to do so-see the "Being Prone" section in the rulebook). They pursue any characters they see, attacking until destroyed.

The eastern half of the building is the old common room, while the western portion held the kitchens and the brewer&#39;s vats. Huge wooden tuns stand to the west, and a faint smell of yeast still permeates the air. The ale is long gone.

        <name>LMoP: RT - 4. Druid’s Watch</name>
        <text>When Reidoth visits Thundertree, this is where he makes camp.

—————————————————————————
This small house appears to be in better condition than the ruined and dilapidated structures nearby. The doors are reinforced with heavy iron bands, and thick shutters protect the windows.
—————————————————————————

Reidoth is a gaunt, white-bearded human who doesn&#39;t use two words when one word will do. Though he receives very few visitors, he is reasonably hospitable.

Reidoth is adept at staying away from the ash zombies that overrun the village, as well as avoiding the area&#39;s mutated plants. He knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and he suspects that someone is hiding out on the eastern side of town-he&#39;s seen "folk in black masks and cloaks" (the cultists) skulking around. However, he is currently most concerned by the fact that a green dragon has moved into the tower (area 7) since the last time he was here. He warns the characters of all these threats, and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they get themselves killed.

DEVELOPMENTS
If the characters ask about Cragmaw Castle, Reidoth gladly provides directions. He is a member of the Emerald Enclave, a widespread group of wilderness survivalists who preserve the natural order while rooting out troublesome threats. The enclave works to restore and preserve the natural order by keeping the elemental forces of the world in check, preventing civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another, and helping others survive the perils of the wilds. The goblins are a threat to the delicate balance.

If the characters ask Reidoth about Wave Echo Cave, he will not divulge its location but will offer to guide the party there in exchange for a favor: he wants them to chase off the dragon in area 7. If they succeed, Reidoth will honor his part of the agreement but will not accompany the party inside the mine.

If the characters attack him for any reason, Reidoth transforms into a gray squirrel and scurries out of the cottage through a crack in the wall. He vanishes into the woods, then waits for the hostile characters to leave. His watch post contains nothing of value.

JOINING THE EMERALD ENCLAVE
If the party helps Reidoth by chasing off Venomfang, the druid privately approaches certain members of the group and urges them to join the Emerald Enclave. He speaks with those who exemplify the ideal of protecting the natural order. If a character agrees, Reidoth gives the individual the title of Springwarden.</text>

        <text>To its south, this farm abuts a field with thick patches of
gorse and briars.

—————————————————————————
This ruin looks as if it might once have been a farmhouse. It is now half swallowed by a dense thicket, with trees growing up through its ruined foundations. The lane continues south a short distance past the ruin before ending in an overgrown field.
—————————————————————————

The thicket east of this ruin is crawling with eight twig blights. Any disturbance in the ruined farmhouse (for example, characters rooting around in the rubble) draws the blights&#39; ire. Each round for 3 rounds, two twig blights head for the south doorway leading into the farmhouse while two more head for the north doorway. The blights attack until destroyed.

        <name>LMoP: RT - 6. Ruined Store</name>
        <text>This former general store is not a complete ruin yet, with
portions of its tile roof still intact.

—————————————————————————
At an intersection near the middle of the Village, a narrow lane winds up the steep hillside to the north. Directly to the south is a ruined building that might have been a store or workshop. Webs stretch across the lane, from the building to the trees on the north sid~ of the road.
—————————————————————————

Two giant spiders hide on the inner walls in this ruined building, so they are not visible from outside. Trailing lines from the webs in the lane allow the spiders to sense when prey is moving through the webs, at which point they nimbly scuttle over the wall and attack. The alert spiders surprise any character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score is less than 17.

Webs. The webs fill two squares north of the doorway (and the square marked "6"). They are difficult terrain, and a creature trying to move through them must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, the creature is restrained in the webs (see the rule book for the effects of being restrained). A snared creature can take an action each round to attempt to break free with a DC 12 Strength check, or it can try to cut its way free by using a light weapon that deals slashing damage. The webs have AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage (see "Damage Resistance and Vulnerability" in the rulebook for how vulnerability works).

Going around the webs is difficult because of the thickets on the north side of the road. Going around the ruined building to the south leads to the twig blights in area 5.

TREASURE
The corpse of an unfortunate adventurer is cocooned in spider silk in the western half of the building. The body is shriveled up and sucked dry, but appears to have been a male elf. The body wears studded leather armor and a shortsword in the scabbard at its hip. A careful search also yields a potion of healing in a belt pouch, along with 23 gp and 35 sp.

        <name>LMoP: RT - 7. Dragon’s Tower</name>
        <text>This tower was formerly the home of a human wizard, who was killed fighting the ash zombies that overran Thundertree thirty years ago.

—————————————————————————
At the top of the hill stands a round tower with a cottage attached. Both are in good condition, although half of the tower&#39;s roof is gone. A door leads into the cottage, and several arrow-slit windows are visible in the tower. You can&#39;t help but notice an eerie quiet in the area and a strange, acrid smell in the air.

The corpses of two hideous giant spiders are sprawled near the edge of the pathway, apparently dragged there. Their bloated bodies are puckered and blistered, and appear to have been mauled by a large animal.
—————————————————————————

A young green dragon named Venomfang has recently claimed the tower, having passed over Thundertree while searching Neverwinter Wood for a suitable lair. The giant spider corpses are the former residents of the tower, killed by the dragon after it tore its way through the roof. Since then, Venomfang has been laying low.

Tower. The dragon lives in the tower-a single room with a 40-foot-high ceiling. A 5-foot-wide staircase circles the interior, rising to the now-opened rooftop that allows the dragon easy access to its new home. Heavy wooden beams and stair supports crisscross the tower interior.

Venomfang does not want to give up such a promising lair, but if the characters reduce the dragon to half its hit points, it climbs to the top of the tower and flies off to fight another day.

Cottage. The cottage contains dusty furniture draped in webbing, but nothing of value. If the characters make a lot of noise in the cottage, the dragon hears them and steels itself for a fight.

TREASURE
An old wooden chest broken open on the tower floor holds the last of the dead wizard&#39;s treasure: 800 sp, 150 gp, four silver goblets set with moonstones (60 gp each), a scroll of misty step, and a scroll of lightning bolt. Venomfang spends much of his time greedily admiring the loot.

The dragon has barely noticed the most interesting item in its hoard. Beneath the coins is a rusty old battleaxe of dwarven manufacture. Runes in Dwarvish on the axe head read, "Hew," and the rust is misleading. Hew is a +1 battleaxe that deals maximum damage when the wielder hits a plant creature or an object made of wood. The axe&#39;s creator was a dwarf smith who feuded with the dryads of a forest where he cut firewood. Whoever carries the axe feels uneasy whenever he or she travels through a forest.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 2,000 XP equally among the characters if the party drives away Venomfang. Given their level, the characters aren&#39;t likely to slay the dragon, but it is worth 3,900 XP.

Two ash zombies (see the "Ash Zombies" sidebar) are slumped on the floor. When the characters enter, the monsters climb to their feet (spending half their speed to do so-see the "Being Prone" section in chapter 2 of the rulebook). Then they attack.

—————————————————————————
This ruined shop is cluttered with sagging storage shelves and broken furniture. Shards of glass and pieces of pottery glint In the weeds and rubble next to rotted books and casks.
—————————————————————————

All the reagents and concoctions here have long since been ruined, and the books are unreadable masses of rot. However, a small wooden case is hidden in a compartment beneath the storage shelves. A character searching through the wreckage can find the case with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The check succeeds automatically if Mirna sent the party to find the heirloom.

On the east side of town, the lane opens up to form a small square. Several ruined buildings surround the south side of the square, but a larger, intact structure to the north looks like a barracks. One lane leads southeast, another heads southwest around the hill in the middle of the town, and a third way meanders north. In the middle of the square, leaning to one side ever so slightly, is a weathered wooden statue of a warrior clutching a spear and shield
—————————————————————————

The leaning statue is ten feet tall, including the base. It depicts an old hero of Neverwinter named Palien, who supposedly defeated several monsters in Neverwinter Wood when Thundertree was first founded. A character who studies the statue recognizes the depiction with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. The statue can be knocked over with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</text>

The barracks appears to have weathered the years better than most buildings in town. Its rooftop features a simple battlement, and arrow-slit windows confirm that it was built to serve as a small ke.ep in times of emergency.
—————————————————————————

Five ash zombies (see the "Ash Zombies" sidebar) lurk within this building. Former members of the garrison, they still wear the remnants of rusted mail and soldiers&#39; surcoats. These scraps of armor do not improve their Armor Class, however. The zombies animate and attack if any living creature disturbs their rest.

The interior of the building still contains furnishings, and the main room has a ladder leading through a trapdoor to the roof. The chamber to the north contains two double bunks, while the chamber to the south has three double bunks, providing quarters for ten soldiers altogether. To the northwest of the main area of the barracks was a kitchen and pantry, now containing piles of well-rotted sacks and barrels that once held salted meat. All the foodstuffs have long since been devoured by vermin.

        <text>A group calling itself the Cult of the Dragon seeks to forge alliances with powerful dragons of the Sword Coast. Toward that end, four cultists recently tracked a green dragon to Thundertree (see area 7) and are waiting for the right moment to approach the dragon and broker an alliance. They have been spying on the dragon from afar, trying to gauge its demeanor and its needs.

—————————————————————————
This small farmhouse appears to be just another empty home at first glance. However, all the doors are shut and windows shuttered.
—————————————————————————

The doors to this cottage are barred from the inside, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open. The shutters are also barred from inside and can be forced with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

Six human cultists are hiding in the house. Four stand guard (two in each room) while the others rest in the larger chamber. The cultists wear black cloaks cut to resemble dragon wings, and black leather masks with stylized dragon horns. In addition to the Common tongue, these cultists speak Draconic.

The interior of the house is dusty and strung with cobwebs. The only furnishings are a small stove, a table, two chairs, and a bunk (which the cultists share).

ROLEPLAYING THE CULTISTS
The cultists are not interested in fighting anyone and
prefer to be left alone. The leader of the group is an evil and ambitious young man named Favric, who hopes to rise through the ranks quickly by earning the allegiance of the green dragon in area 7. His fellow cultists lack Favric&#39;s ambition and flee if he is captured or killed.

If the characters talk to the cultists, Favric explains that they have come to treat with the green dragon (whose name he doesn&#39;t know). If the characters express a similar desire, Favric suggests an alliance. He really plans to offer the characters to the dragon as part of his tribute, and if a fight ensues, the cultists side with the dragon.

TREASURE
In the main room, Favric has a small coffer containing tribute for the green dragon: three diamonds (100 gp each). He also carries a potion of flying in a stoppered vial around his neck.

        <name>LMoP: Wyvern Tor</name>
        <text>This crag is a prominent landmark in the rugged hills northeast of the Sword Mountains, and is easily visible from twenty miles away. People traveling along the Triboar Trail in the vicinity of Conyberry catch glimpses of Wyvern Tor to the south as they go. The tor was formerly the home of a large and dangerous nest of wyverns, but a band of bold adventurers dealt with the monsters years ago. Though the wyverns never returned, other creatures lair here from time to time. Wyvern Tor&#39;s current squatters include a band of ores and their ogre ally.

The ores are scouts of the Many Arrows tribe. These ores often roam into the more civilized areas of the North, spying out human settlements, waylaying travelers, and looting and plundering as opportunities present themselves. Stories of new settlers near Phandalin and renewed traffic along the old Triboar Trail drew this band to the area. Their leader is Brughor Axe-Biter-a savage brute who is more interested in murdering and looting than scouting.</text>

        <name>LMoP: WT - Orc Camp</name>
        <text>Wyvern Tor is a sizable hill, with miles of rugged terrain on its flanks and slopes. Searching for the hidden ore camp takes time. The party can attempt one DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check per hour to find the camp, made by the character leading the way. When the characters find the camp, read the following:

—————————————————————————
The faint smell of smoke hangs on the air as you ascend a rugged ridge on the lower slopes of the hill. Fifty yards away, a cave mouth opens up at the bottom of a ravine. Hunkered down by a boulder twenty yards outside the cave, keeping watch, is a single ore.
—————————————————————————

If the characters can quietly and expeditiously take out the lone ore, they have a chance to surprise the ores in the cave. If the sentry spots the characters sneaking up, or if it is not silenced during the surprise round, the ore retreats back to the cave to warn the others.

The marauders in the cave include Brughor Axe- Biter (an orc with 30 hit points), six ordinary ores, and a filthy ogre named Gog. Gog fights until slain, while the ores fight until Brughor is killed, at which point any remaining ores flee.

TREASURE
Brughor&#39;s band plundered several homesteads farther north on their way to Wyvern Tor. An unlocked treasure chest in the cave holds 750 cp, 180 sp, 62 ep, 30 gp, and three vials of perfume (10 gp each).

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Defeating the monsters at Wyvern Tor completes a quest given to the party by Townmaster Harbin Wester in Phandalin, and it delivers on a promise to Hamun Kost at Old Owl Well. Divide 1,250 XP equally among the characters if the party deals with the ores and the ogre.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Cragmaw Castle</name>
        <text>The Cragmaw tribe consists of marauding bands and rival goblinholds scattered throughout the area of the Triboar Trail and the Neverwinter Wood. However, one chieftain is grudgingly recognized by all others as supreme: King Grol of Cragrnaw Castle.
Cragmaw Castle is not a goblin construction, nor is that the structure&#39;s original name. Raised by a talented wizard-noble of old Phalorm, an ancient realm that once controlled much of the North, the stronghold consists of seven overlapping towers; however, its upper levels have long since collapsed to heaps of crumbling masonry. Only the ground floor is still sound enough to be habitable.

General Features
The centuries have not been kind to Cragmaw Castle. The goblins have shored up the weakest areas beneath its falling towers with crude timbers, but it&#39;s only a matter of time before the structure collapses completely.

Ceilings. Ceilings are 15 feet high unless noted otherwise.

Doors. Interior doors are made of wood reinforced with iron bands. They have neither locks nor keyholes. It takes a successful DC 15 Strength check to break down a door that is barricaded shut.

Floors. Cracked and uneven flagstones conceal a dirt floor underneath.

Light. A small amount of natural light filters through the arrow slits around the castle. During the day, this provides dim light in most areas. At night, all areas are dark.

Walls. Exterior walls and load-bearing interior walls
are 5 feet thick, with 3 feet of mortared fill sandwiched between 1-foot-thick courses of hard stone blocks. Interior walls are I-foot-thick worked stone.

Arrow slits in the castle walls are 10 feet above the outside ground level, 4 feet above the interior floor level, 8 inches wide, and 4 feet high. A creature on one side of an arrow slit gains three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side (see "Cover" in the rulebook).</text>

        <name>LMoP: CC - Disguised Characters </name>
        <text>Rather than storm Cragmaw Castle with weapons in hand,
clever characters might try to talk their way inside. For example, they might don the scarlet cloaks of the Redbrands and claim to be emissaries sent by larno "Glasstaff" Albrek, the Redbrand leader, to meet with King Grol. A good OM rewards this kind of clever thinking by giving the characters a chance to succeed.

It&#39;s okay if the characters circumvent combat and talk their way past castle defenders. Both the Cragmaw tribe and the Redbrands work for the Black Spider, so the goblinoids aren&#39;t likely to attack the party if they claim to be working in the Black Spider&#39;s interest.

If the characters try to perpetrate a deception as a group, have them each make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the monsters&#39; Wisdom (Insight) checks, and give the characters advantage on their checks if the deception is particularly well planned or roleplayed. If at least one character wins the contest, the deception is a success. You may award XP for monsters fooled by the deception. As the party makes its way deeper into the castle, additional checks might be required, at your discretion.</text>

        <text>The main gates between areas 1 and 2 are made of bronze-covered wood, but they are corroded and collapsed.

—————————————————————————
The castle consists of seven crumbling towers of different sizes and heights, but the upper stories are all in varying states of collapse. A short flight of steps leads up to a terrace in front of the main entryway. Past the wreckage of a pair of sundered doors lies a shadowed hall. Round towers loom over the entranceway, with dark arrow slits looking down on the terrace.
—————————————————————————


No monsters dwell here, but the goblin sentries in area 3 are supposed to be keeping watch. They glance only occasionally out of the arrow slits, however, so characters who move quietly might be able to creep past them. Have each character make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. The lowest check is the DC for the goblins&#39; Wisdom checks to notice the party.

DEVELOPMENTS
If the goblins spot the characters (or if the characters approach openly), the goblins shoot arrows from behind the arrow slits. However, they can&#39;t fire directly at enemies at or past the broken gate. The goblins also shout loudly enough to alert their comrades in areas 4 and 6 that the castle is under attack.</text>

—————————————————————————
Doors stand closed to the north and south, with a crumbling mound of rubble partially obscuring the southern hall. To the east, a broad corridor ends in two more doors leading south and east. The corridor is cluttered with dusty rubble and fallen plaster from a partial collapse of the ceiling overhead.
—————————————————————————

If the goblin sentries in area 3 raised the alarm, the goblins and hobgoblins in areas 4 and 6 come running out of the north and south doors at the same time. They attack from both directions, trying to overwhelm the adventurers and drive them out of the castle.

Trap.
The dusty plaster and rubble in front of the door leading to area 8 conceals a copper tripwire connected to linchpins hidden in the ruined ceiling. Spotting the tripwire requires a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of at least 20, or a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check if characters are actively searching for traps in the area. Once spotted, the tripwire is easily avoided and disarmed (no ability check required).

Any creature that walks over or through the rubble without avoiding the tripwire triggers a cave-in of wooden beams and heavy stones. (The area of the collapse is marked on the map.) Any creature in the area when the trap triggers must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage from the falling rubble (half as much damage on a successful save). The noise of the collapse puts the monsters in areas 3, 7, 8, and 9 on alert.

The southwest tower of the castle is little more than a heap of rubble. Several ragged bedrolls are scattered across the remaining floor space, and a small, twisting passage leads east through the ruins.
—————————————————————————

Three goblins bunk here. Though the rubble appears dangerous, the tower is stable, and the eastern passage is safe.

        <text>Caravans raided by the Cragmaws along the High Road and the Triboar Trail supply provisions for the castle.

—————————————————————————
Old casks of salted meat and sacks of rotting grain fill this storage area. Among the supplies, you see a bloody suit of chain mail, a heavy crossbow, and an unsheathed longsword with the emblem of Neverwinter worked into its hilt.
—————————————————————————

Though the stores here are not edible by human standards, the goblins can tolerate them when fresher food isn&#39;t available.
One small cask is filled with an exceptional dwarven brandy, which the goblins overlooked because of its size. The cask contains the equivalent of twenty glasses. A character who imbibes a glass of brandy regains 1 hit point, but a character who drinks two glasses within 1 hour becomes poisoned for 1 hour.

Sildar&#39;s Gear. The chain mail and longsword belong to Sildar Hallwinter. Sildar is grateful if at least his longsword is returned to him.</text>

        <name>LMoP: CC - 6. Hobgoblin Barracks </name>
        <text>The Cragmaws are a mixed tribe of goblinoids, with a handful of bugbears lording over larger numbers of miserable goblins and a few hobgoblins. The hobgoblins plan to dispose of the bugbears and take over someday, but for now, the bugbears are too strong a threat.

—————
Four plain straw pallets and bedrolls are lined up on the floor of this barracks. Brackets on the walls hold a number of weapons-spears, swords, morningstars, and more. The north wall shows signs of damage, but the floor is swept clean of rubble.
—————

Four hobgoblins are quartered in this room. Because their goblin neighbors are always getting into fights, they don&#39;t pay attention to noise in areas 2 or 3. However, they are quick to defend their tower if any intruders appear, or to respond to an alarm raised by the goblin sentries.

TREASURE
Mounted to the walls are five spears, four longswords, three morningstars, two greatswords, and a fine quarterstaff. The quarterstaff is engraved with stylized feathers, is surprisingly light (lIb.), and worth 10 gp.

        <name>LMoP: CC - 7. Banquet Hall</name>
        <text>The lord of the castle once entertained his guests here, throwing lavish banquets and dances. Now this place is a foul goblin mess hall.

————————————-
The western portion of this large hall ends in a wall of rubble, but the remainder is still intact. This must once have been the castle&#39;s banquet hall, with a soaring ceiling twenty-five feet high. Two large wooden tables with plain benches stand in the middle of the room, and a brass brazier full of glowing coals is tucked into one corner. Dirty dishes, half-full stewpots, moldy heels of bread, and gnawed bones cover the tables.
—————————————

This hall holds seven miserable goblins and their leader-a fat, cantankerous goblin with 12 hit points named Yegg. Yegg is the chief cook for the Cragmaws, and he viciously bullies his unwilling assistants as they go about the work of putting food on the tribe&#39;s table. If Yegg is killed, any goblins left alive flee to the east or west, avoiding the north door because of the trap in area 2.

        <name>LMoP: CC - 8. Dark Hall</name>
        <text>Even by day, this area has no exterior light. The boxed text assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.

——————————
This high, narrow hall looks as ifit might have been part of a chapel or shrine at one time. Angelic figures are sculpted along the room&#39;s upper reaches, looking down on the floor below. To the north, heavy curtains block a matching pair of archways. Between the archways is a cracked but ornately carved stone brazier.
——————————

This chamber contains a grick-the special pet of the goblin Lhupo (area 9). The grick likes to climb up to a ledge hidden in the shadows of the statuary in the higher reaches of the room. It quietly observes intruders that enter the area before dropping down to strike. Compare the grick&#39;s Dexterity (Stealth) check to the characters&#39; Wisdom (Perception) checks (or their passive scores) to determine who among them is surprised. The grick knows that goblins are not to be eaten unless Lhupo says so.

The rest of the Cragmaws are terrified of Lhupo&#39;s pet and hurry through this room, preferably in twos or threes.

Any cleric who examines the chapel&#39;s decor can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check to identify the deities that were once revered here: Oghma (god of knowledge), Mystra (goddess of magic), Lathander (god of dawn), and Tymora (goddess of luck). This is an obvious sign that the builders of the castle were human.

DEVELOPMENTS
If combat erupts here, the goblins in area 9 cannot be surprised.

TREASURE
The stone brazier contains a mound of coal, buried under which is a gold statuette of a sun elf (100 gp) wrapped in crimson cloth. A goblin hid the figurine here, hoping his fellow goblins wouldn&#39;t steal it from him.

detect magic spell reveals that the statuette is imbued with divination magic. Any non-evil creature grasping the statue can ask it a question and receive a telepathic response, as though it had cast augury (see the rulebook for a description of this spell). Once a creature has asked its question and received a response, it can never activate the statuette again.

        <name>LMoP: CC - 9. Goblin Shrine</name>
        <text>Goblins have no use for human gods, so the Cragmaws have rededicated this place to Maglubiyet, the god of goblins and hobgoblins.

——————————
This chamber occupies the northern tower of the castle.
A stone altar stands in the middle of the room, covered with bloodstained black cloth. Golden ritual implements-a
chalice, a knife, and a censer-are carefully arranged on top of the altar. Two archways to the south are covered with heavy curtains.
——————————

This shrine is home to Lhupo (a goblin with 12 hit points) and two ordinary goblins that serve as his "acolytes." They all wear filthy robes over their armor, but none of them possess divine powers (although Lhupo claims to hear Maglubiyet speaking to him). If the goblins heardthe characters fighting the gricks in area 8, they hide behind the altar and attempt to surprise the characters. Otherwise, all three goblins are kneeling before the altar, praying to their evil god.

The bloodstained cloth completely covers the stone altar, the sides of which are engraved with images of the same gods reflected in the decor found in area 8.

TREASURE
The chalice, knife, and censer are human-made art objects worth 150 gp, 60 gp, and 120 gp, respectively.

        <name>LMoP: CC - 10. Posters Gate</name>
        <text>This side entrance to the castle is locked but unguarded.

———————-
On the south side of the old castle, an overgrown path leads to a passage that climbs up into the wall. A large iron door stands here, sheltered from direct outside attack. Arrow slits ten feet above the ground overlook the path.
———————-

The iron door is locked. It can be opened with thieves&#39; tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or knocked down with a successful DC 25 Strength check.

Arrow Slits. Any character who pauses and listens near the arrow slits hears, from area 7, an occasional clatter
of crockery and angry goblins arguing over whether the dishes need cleaning. The goblins aren&#39;t keeping watch from these arrow slits. However, if the characters make a lot of noise or commotion, such as knocking down the door, the goblins come and look. If they see intruders outside, they shout an alarm.</text>

        <name>LMoP: CC - 11. Ruined Tower</name>
        <text>Dusty canvas (marked with a "C" on the map) hides the northern entrance to this area, blending in with the surrounding stonework and rubble. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a footpath leading up to the hidden entrance. If the characters are actively searching the outside of the castle for a hidden entrance, they can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the canvas "door."

———————-
This tower has almost completely collapsed, although the ground floor still has a little open space. Rotting crates and ancient barrels show that provisions were once stored here. A heavy curtain blocks a crumbling area to the south, and an intact door leads east. To the north, a short passage through the rubble ends before a screen of canvas.

        <text>The creatures here keep watch from the arrow slit, so any characters creeping around the east side of the castle are likely to be spotted and attacked.

———————-
A stone brazier full of coals glows in the middle of this small barracks. Four straw pallets are lined up along the east wall. The wall to the south has collapsed, but a barred wooden door in that direction is still clear. A curtain hangs in an archway to the north.
———————-

Two hobgoblins stand guard in this room. They are smart, tough, and loyal to King Grol. At the start of combat, one hobgoblin runs to warn the king in area 14, then returns 2 rounds later to rejoin the fray.

This area was once a parlor for the castle&#39;s human occupants, though its rotted furnishings were broken up by the Cragmaws and used for firewood.

        <name>LMoP: CC - 13. Owlbear Tower</name>
        <text>The door to this room is held shut with a heavy wooden bar-a subtle warning that danger lies beyond. When the bar is lifted, the creature in the room awakens and lets out a terrible roar.
The arrow slits here are shuttered, leaving the room dark. The boxed text assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.

———————-
The upper floors of this tower have collapsed to create a hollow silo at least thirty feet high, and the upper reachesof the room are lost in shadows. Dust, rubble, and broken glass cover the floor, and old worktables and bookshelves lie strewn to the south. ln the middle of the room is a hulking beast that looks like a mangy bear with an owl&#39;s head. It rears up and roars when it sees you.
———————-

The Cragmaws have captured an owlbear and confined it.to this tower. The room is kept dark to keep the beast calm, but King Grol doesn&#39;t know what to do with it yet. If a character throws it fresh meat, the owlbear devours the food. Otherwise, it attacks the first creature it sees in the doorway.

This room was once a library and workshop, but nothing of its original contents remains intact.

DEVELOPMENTS
If the characters open the door and stay out of the owlbear&#39;s way, it flees the castle (most likely through area 11). The creature attacks anything that gets in its way.

TREASURE
All that remains of the tower&#39;s second floor is a jagged ledge, upon which sits a battered wooden chest. The chest is hard to see from the floor, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice. The chest is unlocked and contains 90 ep, 120 gp, a potion of healing, a scroll of silence, and a scroll of revivify.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS

        <name>LMoP: CC - 14. King’s Quarters</name>
        <text>Any character who listens at the door hears two voices in a heated discussion-a loud, growling voice demanding payment for something, and a silky smooth reply.

——————————
This chamber has been set up as a crude living space, with thick furs thrown on the floor to serve as carpets, old trophies hanging on the walls, a large bed to the north, and a brazier of coals burning brightly. A round table with several chairs stands to the south near the door. Near the table, on the floor, is an unconscious dwarf who looks badly beaten.
——————————

King Grol is a fierce old bugbear with 45 hit points. He rules the Cragmaws through pure intimidation. Age has stooped his shoulders and hunched his back, but he remains surprisingly agile and strong. He is demanding and vindictive, and no Cragmaw dares to cross him.

Grol is attended by Snarl, a wolf with 18 hit points, and a doppelganger disguised as a female drow. The doppelganger, Vyerith, is a messenger from the Black Spider, come to collect Gundren Rockseeker and the map of Wave Echo Cave from King Grol. Grol wants to sell the map instead of surrendering it, and he and the drow are negotiating a price. Vyerith first wants to question Gundren to find out if anyone else knows the location of Wave Echo Cave. Then the doppelganger intends to kill the dwarf and destroy the map.

If the villains have been warned that an attack is imminent, Vyerith hides behind the door to the northeast, leaving it open a crack and hoping to attack an intruder from the rear. Grol holds Gundren hostage, ready to kill the dwarf if the characters don&#39;t back off.

Arrow Slits. The arrow slits are 15 feet above the ground outside, and the creatures here aren&#39;t keeping watch. They are unlikely to notice intruders moving around the exterior of the castle.
Northwest Room. This partially collapsed chamber was once a comfortable bathroom. It still contains a large tile tub, unused by the castle&#39;s current occupants.

Unconscious Dwarf. Near the southwest corner of the room is Gundren Rockseeker, a dwarf commoner. He is unconscious but stable at 0 hit points.

DEVELOPMENTS
If Grol is killed, Vyerith tries to kill Gundren and flee with the map, heading toward area 11 and escaping through the concealed canvas door. If cornered, the doppelganger fights to the death rather than allow itself to be captured.

If Gundren is revived, he thanks the party for coming to his rescue but won&#39;t leave Cragmaw Castle without his map. Unfortunately, he doesn&#39;t know where King Grol has hidden it (see the "Treasure" section).

TREASURE
Hidden under Grol&#39;s bed mattress is a stitched leather sack containing 220 sp, 160 ep, three potions of healing, and Gundren&#39;s map to Wave Echo Cave.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 950 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats King Grol, the wolf, and the doppelganger. Award an additional 200 XP to the party if the characters rescue Gundren Rockseeker and escort him safely back to Phandalin.</text>

        <name>What’s Next</name>
        <text>RETURNING WAR BAND

You can add a complication in the form of a hobgoblin war band returning home, just as the characters are preparing to leave. This war band consists of three hobgoblins led by Targor Bloodsword, a hobgoblin with 20 hit points. Targor also has two wolves as pets.
The hobgoblins have no treasure, but 1d4 of them carry bloody sacks, each containing a severed elf head. The severed heads are trophies from the hobgoblins&#39; recent victory over an elf hunting party.

Clever characters might try to reason with Targor by urging him to think of himself as Grol&#39;s successor rather than Grol&#39;s avenger. Targor has long aspired to lead the Cragmaw tribe, so he might do the adventurers the favor of not killing them, provided one or more characters succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS
Divide 500 XP equally among the characters if they defeat the hobgoblin war band or com~ to terms with Targor.

WHAT&#39;S NEXT?
If Gundren Rockseeker survives the ordeal at Cragmaw Castle, he offers the characters his thanks and asks that they escort him back to Phandalin and then venture to Wave Echo Cave to learn the fate of his brothers, Nundro and Tharden. He knows that someone called the Black Spider orchestrated his capture and hopes that the characters stop the villain. Upon returning to Phandalin, Gundren offers the characters 25 gp each for their assistance and promises the party a 10 percent share of the mine&#39;s wealth once his operation there is up and running.

Whether the characters sought the information from Agatha or Reidoth, negotiated with Hamun Kost, or recovered Gundren and his map from Cragmaw Castle, they now know the location of Wave Echo Cave. The only thing left for them to do is seek out the old dwarven delve and discover for themselves who the Black Spider is, and why he&#39;s so interested in the Lost Mine of Phandelver.</text>

If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	
Paralyzed:
• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can&#39;t take actions or reactions, and can&#39;t move or speak.
	
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	
• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

Paralyzed:
• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can&#39;t take actions or reactions, and can&#39;t move or speak.
	
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	
• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

Paralyzed:
• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can&#39;t take actions or reactions, and can&#39;t move or speak.
	
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	
• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

	The hand can&#39;t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere&#39;s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.
	When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
	
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

              <text>The spectator shoots up to two of the following magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90 ft. of it. It can use each ray only once on a turn.
	1. Confusion Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or it can&#39;t take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the target can&#39;t move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can&#39;t attack, it does nothing on its turn.
	2. Paralyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	3. Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	4. Wounding Ray. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	
Frightened:
• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	
• The creature can&#39;t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.
	
Paralyzed:
• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can&#39;t take actions or reactions, and can&#39;t move or speak.
	
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	
• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

              <text>The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger&#39;s concentration isn&#39;t broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target&#39;s mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.</text>

              <text>Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
	
Paralyzed:
• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can&#39;t take actions or reactions, and can&#39;t move or speak.
	
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	
• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
	
Poisoned:
• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>

As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
	
Restrained:
• A restrained creature&#39;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have disadvantage.
	
• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</text>

        <name>LMoP: Part 4 - Wave Echo Cave</name>
        <text>Fifteen miles east of Phandalin, in the deep vales of the Sword Mountains, lies Wave Echo Cave. The rich mine of the Phandelver&#39;s Pact was lost five hundred years ago during ore invasions that devastated this part of the North.

In the centuries since, countless prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost mine, but none succeeded until the Rockseeker brothers found the entrance a month ago.

Unfortunately, the Rockseekers did not realize they were being trailed by spies working for Nezznar, the Black Spider, and they inadvertently led the drow villain to their prize. Nezznar and his followers dealt with the two Rockseekers who were guarding their find, then arranged for Gundren&#39;s ambush. Learning of the adventurers&#39; involvement with Gundren or their exploits in and around Phandalin, the Black Spider has given orders for the characters to be dealt with. Meanwhile, Nezznar has begun his exploration of Wave Echo Cave.

The drow is searching for the Forge of Spells, where the human mages of old Phandalin enchanted dwarven weapons and gnome gadgets. However, Nezznar&#39;s exploration has been hindered by the restless undead and dangerous monsters that lurk in Wave Echo Cave, forcing him to proceed with great caution.

The adventurers now have the chance to aid Gundren, avenge his kin, and put a stop to the nefarious schemes of the Black Spider. And of course, the hoard of powerful magic rumored to be hidden in the mines is a rich prize.

        <text>The mine is cold, damp, and surprisingly drafty. A noticeable breeze blows through many of its passages, flowing from area 1 toward area 16.

Ceilings. Tunnels are 10 feet high unless noted otherwise. Rooms have 20-foot-high ceilings, while natural caverns have 30-foot-high ceilings dotted with stalactites.

Doors. Unless noted otherwise, all doors are 6 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and made of six-inch-thick cut slabs of stone fitted with iron handles and hinges. The doors are low and wide-perfect for dwarves.

Wal1s.The walls are hewn stone. In a few areas (14, 15, 19, and 20), they are dressed with well-fitted stone blocks.

Floors. All floors are smooth, natural stone.
Light. None unless otherwise indicated. The boxed text assumes that the characters have light sources or darkvision.

Stalagmites. Found in many of the natural caverns, these spires of rock rise up from the floor and can be used for cover (see "Cover" in the rulebook).</text>

        <name>LMoP: Wandering Monsters</name>
        <text>Monsters roam through all areas of the mine. Random encounters remind players that monsters aren&#39;t necessarily confined to specific areas, and that no part of the dungeon is safe. Encounters with wandering monsters are an effective way to keep the players and characters on their toes, alleviate player boredom, and tax party resources. However, having too many random encounters can become tedious, so use them sparingly.

If the characters spend a long time in a given area, you can check for wandering monsters by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17-20, an encounter takes place. Conversely, if the players seem restless, you can decide that an encounter occurs. Roll a d12 and consult the Wandering Monsters table to determine what the party meets.

        <name>LMoP: Booming Waves</name>
        <text>All good dungeons have characteristics that make them unique, and Wave Echo Cave is no exception. The rhythmic thunder of pounding waves echoes throughout the mine, loud enough to make the stone underfoot shiver. Waves come about two minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast.

Wave Echo Cave is nowhere near the ocean, but a water-filled cavern deep in the mine is connected to an underground hot spring. That spring boils over continuously to produce a surge that slams into a narrow funnel, making a sound like breaking surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion. It will pique their curiosity and lure them toward its source, drawing them deeper into the mine as a consequence.</text>

        <name>LMoP: WEC - 1. Cave Entrance</name>
        <text>Whether the characters follow Gundren&#39;s map or receive directions to Wave Echo Cave from another source, their initial approach leads them to a narrow tunnel whose entrance is hidden within the Sword Mountain foothills.

——————————
The entrance tunnel leads into a large-cavern supported by a natural pillar of rock and containing three stalagmites. In the western part of the cave, behind the column ofrock, are three bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies-sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.

The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down the side of the pit, at the bottom of which is a rough-hewn tunnel heading northwest and east.
——————————

This was the campsite of the Rockseekers. The dead dwarf is Tharden, Gundren&#39;s brother, who was killed by the Black Spider. Gundren&#39;s other brother, Nundro, was here as well and is currently the Black Spider&#39;s prisoner in area 20. The dwarves&#39; supplies are potentially useful, but not particularly valuable.

Open Pit. Climbing up or down the wall of the pit without a rope requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A character who fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes Id6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the bottom. The tunnel at the bottom of the pit leads northwest toward area 2 and east toward area 3.

TREASURE
Tharden wears a pair of boots of striding and springing. In his haste to explore the rest of Wave Echo Cave, Nezznar overlooked them.</text>

        <name>LMoP: WEC - 2. Mine Tunnels</name>
        <text>This maze of passages is an old section of Wave Echo
Cave&#39;s original mine site.

——————————
This area consists of numerous intersecting passages. I The ceilings here are only six feet high, and several of the
passages end in partially excavated rock faces.
——————————

The dead-end passages are places where the miners gave up and decided to move on to other spots. Patiently lurking in one is an ochre jelly. When the party enters this section of the mine, the jelly begins to stalk the group, instinctively waiting for an opportunity to attack a lone target.

        <name>LMoP: WEC - 3. Old Entrance </name>
        <text>The tunnel that runs south was the original entrance to Wave Echo Cave, but it was buried by the destruction that wracked the mines centuries ago. A pitched battle was fought here when the ores stormed the mines. The dead still lie where they fell.

—————
Many tunnels intersect at this natural, thirty-foot-high cavern. The walls are carved with simple reliefs showing dwarf and gnome miners hard at work. Below them, nearly two dozen skeletons in rusted scraps of armor are scattered across the cavern floor. Some are dwarf skeletons, while others are orc remains. Half a dozen large brass lanterns stand in niches or on ledges around the cavern, but none are lit.
—————

Clinging to the ceiling like bats are ten stirges. The monsters find scant living prey in the mines, and they are ravenous. If the characters are looking down at the skeletons on the floor, the stirges are likely get the drop on them. Any character who isn&#39;t watching the ceiling is surprised unless his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is higher than the stirges&#39; Dexterity (Stealth) check total (roll once for all of them). Characters who aren&#39;t surprised hear a flapping noise as the stirges descend to attack.

The lanterns and the carvings of miners at work were meant as a welcome to newcomers.</text>

———————-
Splintered stone benches and heaps of rubble from a partially collapsed ceiling fill this room. Amid ruined stone bunks and toppled weapon racks are the bones of several dwarves and orcs.
———————-

In the round after any living creature enters this chamber, the bones begin to stir and knit together, forming nine skeletons. They fight until destroyed.</text>

————————
This chamber was once an office or storeroom of some kind. A large stone counter bisects the room, set with three dusty balance scales made of iron. Cubbyholes carved into the north wall are stuffed with dusty paper scraps. Several long- dead corpses-gnomes and ores by their look-are sprawled across the floor.
————————

The centuries-old paper in the cubbyholes disintegrates if touched, but a character who reads Dwarvish can see faint markings on a few scraps, recording weigh-ins and disbursements.

Behind the counter sits a locked iron strongbox, requiring thieves&#39; tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check to open. This pay chest was overlooked in the fighting and contains 600 cp, 180 sp, 90 ep, and 60 gp.</text>

Old stone bunks in orderly rows line the walls of this chamber, and a corroded iron brazier full of old coals stands near the middle of the room. The bones of a half dozen dwarves and orcs lie strewn about, clad in scraps of armor. Three gray, hunched figures squat among the remains, pawing at the scraps and gnawing on the bones.
———————-

Three ghouls from the pack in area 9 are here, cracking and gnawing on the ancient bones of the fallen in the vain hope that some tasty morsel of marrow remains. The ghouls, eager for a fresh meal, attack immediately.</text>

The eastern wall of this chamber has collapsed into a mass of rubble. To the north, a door stands ajar, leading to a good- sized storeroom. Dusty kegs are tucked neatly against the walls, all of them cracked and split open from age.
———————————-

It&#39;s not comfortable, but the storeroom is a secure resting place. No monsters come this way. Moreover, the storeroom door is in good shape and can easily be blocked or barred from the inside.

        <text>This cave has hindered Nezznar&#39;s explorations. The drow suspects that the mine&#39;s magic workshops are close by, but he&#39;s reluctant to risk dealing with the monsters here.

———————-
Dense carpets of weird fungi cover large sections of the floor in this cavern. The growth includes puffballs a foot across, weird shelf fungus growing on stalagmites, and large stalks and caps a good five feet tall. Some of the puffballs glow with an eerie green phosphorescence.
———————-

Most of the fungi is harmless, and the green-glowing fungi allow creatures to see the entire cavern without the aid of darkvision or a light source.

Poison Gas. Whenever a creature attempts to cross
the cavern, the carpets of fungi that cover most of the floor release poisonous gas into the air. Each creature in the cavern must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage and be poisoned for 10 minutes.

        <text>This cave once served as the banquet room, meeting area, and mead hall for the miners.

——————————
Steep escarpments divide this large cavern into three sections-high ledges at either end, and a lower section in the middle. Carved stone stairs climb up to the ledges. Two large tables stand in the middle section, along with a pair of old braziers. A smaller table stands on the eastern ledge. The skeletal remains of dozens of dead warriors-dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and ogres-attest to the fierceness of the fighting that took place here long ago.
——————————

Seven ghouls lurk in the shadows on the western ledge. They notice any light or noise elsewhere in the cave and quickly bound down to attack. The undead are hungry and fight until destroyed.

The escarpments are 10 feet high and require a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to climb. A creature that falls or is knocked from the top of a ledge takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone.</text>

        <text>Treasure is concealed in this water-filled cave.

————————-
A still pool fills much of this cavern. The water is dark, revealing little of what might lie within. The shore of the pool consists of a thin layer of broken shells from strange, pale mussels, and a fishy odor hangs in the air.

A passage leads south from this area, and a set of steps climbs up to the east. A sluggish stream flows out of the cave to the northeast.
————————-

The pool is 20 feet deep in the middle. The stream to the northeast is 3 feet deep, and the ceiling of the passage is 2 to 3 feet above the water. Characters can easily wade through the stream to area 18.

A character who explores the pool finds an old skeleton lying on the bottom, 10 feet from the shore and under 10 feet of water. These are the remains of a human wizard from old Phandalin who died defending the mines against the ore attackers. Several ore arrows are still lodged in the skeleton&#39;s ribcage.

TREASURE
The skeleton wears two platinum rings (75 gp each) and clutches a wand of magic missiles in its bony fingers.</text>

Across the room is another door, this one blocked by a barricade made from the remains of a wooden table.

Five bugbears reside in this chamber. They are loyal minions of Nezznar. This room marks the front line in the Black Spider&#39;s assault on Wave Echo Cave, and the bugbears are here to prevent ghouls, zombies, or other undead from troubling their master in his lair (area 19).

Like area 6, this was formerly a barracks for miners. Nezznar&#39;s bugbears removed the corpses they found here and built the barricade.

        <text>Like the fungi cavern at area 8, this chamber poses a serious obstacle that prevents Nezznar from reaching his objective-the Forge of Spells (area 15). The drow is still formulating a plan to get past the undead guardians in this area.

———————-
A blast furnace and a mechanical bellows powered by a waterwheel dominate this large chamber. The furnace is cold and dark, but heaps of coal are piled nearby, along with carts full of unrefined ore. The waterwheel sits in a ten-foot-wide channel cut into the floor of the room, but the channel is dry. Passages exit to the west, south, and east. The empty channel exits to the north and east.
More than a dozen withered corpses are scattered around the room. These slain dwarves and orcs are still wearing
the remnants of their armor. Floating above them is a skull engulfed in green flame.
———————-

Eight of the fallen dwarf warriors are zombies. They rise and pursue any living creatures that enter the room, but they do not pursue creatures outside this area for more than 1 round. In addition, a far more intelligent undead guards this area: a ftameskull. This creature was a servant of the human wizards allied with the Phandelver dwarves and gnomes, and it continues to act on ancient instructions to prevent intruders from passing through.
This impressive chamber was the heart of the Wave Echo Cave mining operation. Here, the dwarves melted down their ore to refine ingots of silver, gold, and platinum. The dry channel is where the dwarves diverted the stream from area 18 to power the waterwheel here. That in turn operated the bellows that fed the furnace.

The channel&#39;s bottom is 5 feet below floor level, and no ability check is required to scramble in or out. Characters
in the channel can follow it out of this room to the north or to the east, though the ceiling is only 5 feet high after the channel exits this room.</text>

        <text>The structural damage and the skeletal remains in this area are evidence of the destructive spell battle fought here centuries ago when the orcs and their mercenary wizards stormed the mines.

—————
Glittering minerals in the ceiling of this large cavern catch the light and send it back to create the impression of a starry night sky. Dozens of skeletons-many crushed under fallen debris-are scattered across the floor.

The cave is large enough that it contains two freestanding structures. Each of these stone buildings is proportioned
for human use, as opposed to the dwarf-sized doorways
and furnishings you&#39;ve seen elsewhere in the mines. Both structures have battered and blackened masonry walls, their double doors cracked and scorched.

The cavern is divided by an escarpment, into which a flight of stairs has been cut. Passages lead out of this area to the north, south, and west.
—————

The damaged buildings are described in areas 14 and 15. Minerals in the ceiling are pretty, but they are neither magical nor valuable.
Any character proficient in Arcana can sense a subtle aura of magic in this cavern. (A detect magic spell reveals the same.) The aura becomes stronger as one approaches the northern building (area 15).

        <text>The doors leading into this area are cracked, their iron hinges partially melted. Wrenching or smashing open the doors requires a successful DC 15 Strength check.

———————-
Dust, ash, walls blackened by fire, and heaps of debris beneath the sagging ceiling show that this room was
damaged by a destructive blast. The furnishings-tables,
chairs, bookshelves, beds-are charred or splintered, but otherwise well preserved. A scorched iron chest stands near the foot of one of the beds.
———————-

This room contains the restless spirit of the last wizard to die here: Mormesk the wraith. He is not immediately visible but rises up out of the floor when a living creature enters the room.

Mormesk was a powerful mage until he met his end in the spell battle at the climax of the ore attack. Centuries of anger have poisoned his soul, transforming him into a hate-filled apparition.
Mormesk leads the undead that haunt Wave Echo Cave. The wraith spends his time here because the treasure he had amassed in life is in the scorched chest (see the "Treasure" section). No longer corporeal, he cannot touch or possess the wealth he enjoyed in life.

This building served as a guesthouse for visiting wizards working in the Forge of Spells (area 15), most of whom were humans from nearby cities. The furnishings are all human proportioned.

Mormesk speaks in grave whispers. When the wraith first rises up from the floor, it says, "Your presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!" If the characters make no attempt to reason with the wraith, it attacks.
If the characters try to reason with the wraith, it listens to what they have to say, provided they have not harmed it in any way or seized any of its property. The wraith is irrevocably evil, so the only way the characters can stay its spectral hand is to offer it something a former wizard would consider valuable in exchange for their lives. Mormesk values magic items (particularly scrolls), spellbooks, and arcane knowledge. Whatever the gift, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the wraith of its value.

Regardless of what the characters offer it, the wraith won&#39;t relinquish the wooden pipe in the scorched chest.

It will, however, part with the coins and gems if the characters agree to kill the spectator in the Forge of Spells. (The wraith doesn&#39;t explain what a spectator is. It merely points toward area 15.) Once it receives its gift, the wraith allows characters to peruse its books and keep the secret map in one of them (see the "Treasure" section).

The scorched chest is unlocked and contains 1,100 cp, 160 sp, 50 ep, three diamonds (100 gp each), and a wooden
pipe adorned with platinum filigree (150 gp).

A handful of magically preserved tomes remain on the shelves. Most are just histories, but one has a map sewn into its cover. The map&#39;s presence can be discerned with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The shows the location of a dungeon of your own creation. When the characters finish their explorations here, this old map can lead them to their next adventure.</text>

        <text>Here is where the wizards allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver&#39;s Pact channeled the magic of these caverns to enchant dwarven arms and gnome gadgets. The northernmost door is scorched and cracked, its iron hinges partially melted; forcing it open requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. The western double doors are just as damaged but stand slightly ajar.

———————-
This large workshop was badly damaged by the ancient
spell battle that laid waste to the mine. Worktables taking up two corners of the room are scorched, and the plaster has been burned off the masonry walls. In the middle of the room, a stone pedestal holds a small brazier in which an eerie green flame dances and crackles. The brazier and its pedestal appear to have been untouched by the forces that destroyed this area.

Behind the brazier of green flame floats a spherical creature measuring roughly four feet in diameter. Four eyestalks protrude from its central mass, two on each side. In the center of the body is a large eye that stares at you.

"Hello," says a thick, burbling voice inside your head.
———————-

The monster that guards this room is a spectator. One of the human wizards who worked in the Forge of Spells summoned the creature to guard the magic items created and stored here. When the mine was sacked, the ores disturbed the delicate magic in the area, unhinging the spectator&#39;s grip on reality. It has become deranged and believes that the mine is still in use, ignoring all evidence to the contrary.

The wraith (area 14) wants to drive off or kill the spectator, but so far, the creature has easily handled the assaults of Mormesk&#39;s zombies and ghouls while seeing nothing strange about undead roaming the mine. If the party attempts to remove anything from this area, the spectator attacks. If the spectator is blinded somehow, it disappears back to its home plane, convinced that it can no longer perform the task for which it was summoned.

With a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check, a character can trick the spectator into thinking one or more party members are wizards or miners who work for the owners of Wave Echo Cave, sent to terminate the spectator&#39;s employment. If the deception succeeds, the spectator believes it is released from its obligations, and it disappears and returns to its home plane.

Brazier of Green Flame. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the brazier as the source of the magic that suffuses the surrounding caverns. This magic has waned over the years, to the extent that it can no longer be harnessed to permanently enchant magic items. However, any nonmagical weapon or armor bathed in the green flame for at least 1 minute becomes a +1 weapon or +1 armor, respectively, for Id12 hours (see appendix A). The brazier cannot be removed from the Forge of Spells.

Northern Room. This small room is a separate workspace, where items being prepared for enchantment were polished, lacquered, and otherwise finished. Like the main workshop, it has been almost completely destroyed.

On the worktable in the southeast corner of the room are the last items the spectator was charged to protect: Lightbringer and Drsgongusrd.

Lightbringer. This +1 mace was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a torch when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra Id6 radiant damage to undead creatures.

Dragonguard. This +1 breastplate has a gold dragon motif worked into its design. Created for a human hero of Neverwinter named Tergon, it grants its wearer advantage on saving throws against the breath weapons of creatures that have the dragon type.</text>

———————-
A narrow ledge overlooks a large cavern that houses a surging, seething body of water. The rhythmic booming heard throughout the mines is louder here. At regular intervals,
a fresh surge of water funnels into this chamber and slams against the wall just below the ledge. The echo suggests that this cave might be one arm of a much larger cavern to the northeast.
———————-

The ledge that hugs the south wall is 15 feet above water level. However, when water surges into the cave every 2 minutes, it raises the water level by 10 feet. After a minute, the water level returns to its normal depth of 20 feet.

———————-
This passageway is barely four feet high and is obstructed I by rounded boulders and pebbles. It might have been a
streambed, though no water flows here now.
———————-

The dwarves diverted the stream into the channel leading to area 12 to drive the waterwheel in the smelter. Then the earthquakes that rocked Wave Echo Cave during the final spell battle of the orc invasion collapsed the floor in area 18, diverting the stream once again. The old streambed remains as a usable passage that circumvents the undead in area 12, although Nezznar has not yet discovered this.

        <text>Nezznar&#39;s servants occupy this cavern, guarding against undead incursions and carefully sifting through the rubble. The Black Spider&#39;s divinations suggest that some valuable treasure is hidden at the bottom of the rift that was created when this area was destroyed.

—————
A wide rift fills the eastern half of this cavern. A stream pours out of the west wall, then tumbles down into the rift and flows out again to the north. Several ropes are secured to iron stakes along on the western edge of the rift, leading down to the chasm floor.
—————

Three bugbears are stationed here. Two of them are clearing rock on the rift floor while one more stands guard in the western half of the cavern. A doppelganger named Vhalak supervises the operation in the guise of a male drow. If a fight breaks out in the main cavern, the two bugbears in the rift climb up the ropes to join the fray.

Rift. The rift is 20 feet deep. Climbing up or down without using a rope requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature that fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the bottom.

If two or more bugbears are killed, the doppelganger tries to retreat to area 19 to warn Nezznar.

Nezznar&#39;s divinations are accurate. Buried under heavy rubble at the bottom of the rift is the crushed skeleton of a dwarf wearing gauntlets of ogre power. The remains are hidden from view but can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each character searching can attempt one check per hour.</text>

        <text>Nezznar uses this room as his headquarters while he
explores the mines and searches for the Forge of Spells.

——————-
Six cracked marble pillars line the walls of this hall, at the north end of which stands a nine-foot-tall statue of a dwarf seated on a throne, a mighty stone warhammer across his lap. Large emeralds gleam in the statue&#39;s eyes.
The dust and debris covering the floor has been swept to one side, and a campsite of sorts now spreads in front of the statue. Half a dozen bedrolls and packs are neatly arranged around a rough-built fire pit. A wooden table stands on the west side of the room between two pillars.
——————-

If the room&#39;s occupants are not aware of the characters as they enter, add the following:

——————-
Two bugbears stand by the table, flanking a dark elf dressed in black leather armor and robes. He clutches a black staff with a carved spider at the top and frowns as he sees you. "It seems that I must deal with you myself. A pity it must end this way."
——————-

Nezznar the Black Spider is joined by four giant spiders that defend their master to the death. If they are expecting trouble, the spiders hide behind pillars, and Nezznar casts invisibility on himself and stands near the table. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the spiders. When intruders appear, the spiders try to entangle them in webs before closing to melee range. Nezznar joins the fray on the
round after the spiders attack.

If the doppelganger from area 18 retreated to this
area, it assumes the guise of Nundro Rockseeker so that Nezznar can use the "dwarf" as leverage to force the party&#39;s surrender (although the drow won&#39;t actually harm the doppelganger). See the "Roleplaying Nezznar" section for more information on the drow villain.

Statue. The statue depicts Dumathoin, the dwarven god of mining. Any character who has proficiency in Religion recognizes the deity. The statue is beautifully carved, and its emerald eyes appear extremely valuable. However, the jewels are clever fakes made of worthless glass, as close inspection and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals. Nevertheless, a powerful spell protects them, and a detect magic spell reveals a strong aura of abjuration magic surrounding the statue.

A character can climb the statue easily and pry a jewel loose with a successful DC 10 Strength check. However, if either eye is removed, the pillars that line the walls crack, triggering a ceiling collapse. Each creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4dlO bludgeoning damage from falling rubble and falling prone on a failure, or taking only half the damage on a success.

Table. The table is strewn with notes and maps showing Nezznar&#39;s efforts at exploring the mine so far. A black leather sack of treasure is amid the papers (see the "Treasure" section).

The creatures in area 18 can hear sounds of combat in this room. If they haven&#39;t already been dealt with, they arrive after 3 rounds and act immediately after Nezznar&#39;s giant spiders in the initiative count.
If the characters capture Nezznar and deliver him to the town master&#39;s hall in Phandalin, the drow is locked up until Sildar Hallwinter or another representative of the Lords&#39; Alliance can escort him to Neverwinter to face justice and interrogation.

However, unless the characters post guards outside Nezznar&#39;s cell, Halia Thornton (see page 17) breaks him out of jail, smuggles him out of Phandalin, and delivers him into the waiting arms of the Zhentarim. The Zhents want to learn everything the Black Spider knows about Wave Echo Cave. What happens to Nezznar at that point is up to you.

Nezznar carries a potion of healing and a spider staff. In addition, the drow carries an iron key with a head shaped like an anvil. This key unlocks the door to area 20.

Nezznar&#39;s exploration of Wave Echo Cave has yielded some treasure, which the drow keeps in the sack on the wooden table. The sack contains 190 ep, 130 gp, 15 pp, nine small gemstones (10 gp each), and a dwarven ale mug made of hammered electrum (100 gp).

If Nezznar is captured alive and delivered to Sildar Hallwinter or Townmaster Wester in Phandalin, award the party double his XP value.</text>

        <text>The door to this room is locked, requiring thieves&#39; tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open. Nezznar (area 19) carries the key.

Unless the characters are being stealthy, any activity at the door attracts the attention of Nezznar and his allies in area 19, prompting the drow to send his giant spiders to investigate.

—————
Dusty draperies adorn the walls of this room, which also I contains a bed and brazier. A badly disheveled dwarf lies bound and unconscious on the cold stone floor.
—————

This room formerly belonged to the priest in charge of Dumathoin&#39;s temple (area 19), but Nezznar has appropriated it for use as a cell. The figure lying on the floor is Nundro, a dwarf commoner and the youngest of the three Rockseeker brothers. Nezznar spared him because he thought the dwarf might know more about the mine than he admitted. The drow has interrogated Nundro harshly once or twice a day ever since capturing him.

Nundro is grateful if the adventurers rescue him, and he offers to tag along for the duration of their stay in Wave Echo Cave. Nundro doesn&#39;t know any more about the layout than the characters, so he hasn&#39;t much to offer in the way of useful information. See the "NPC Party Members" sidebar (page 11) for tips on running Nundro.

If the characters deal with Nezznar and his minions, this area serves as a safe and comfortable place to rest before continuing their explorations of the mine.

If Nundro is rescued and survives the adventure, divide 200 XP equally among the characters in the party.

      <text>Sildar Hallwinter is a kindhearted human male of nearly fifty years who holds a place of honor in the famous griffon cavalry of the great city of Water deep. He is an agent of the Lords&#39; Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and homelands.

Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accpmpany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of larno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords&#39; Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to larno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.

Sildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information:

o The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver&#39;s Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the "Background" section to the players at this time.) Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn&#39;t know who or what the Black Spider is.

o Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave
Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn&#39;t know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn&#39;t occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle&#39;s location. See the "What the Goblins Know" sidebar on page 8.)

Sildar&#39;s contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords&#39; Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.

Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it&#39;s the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they&#39;ll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.</text>

      <text>A former member of the Lords&#39; Alliance, larno seized
an opportunity in Phandalin to line his own pockets. Originally tasked with setting up a constabulary, the mage instead assembled a group of outlaws and local ruffians to secure his own position in town.

larno knew of the Black Spider through his contacts in the Lords&#39; Alliance and brokered a meeting. The drow promised to share the secrets and wealth of the Forge of Spells with the wizard in exchange for his help and loyalty.

larno puts on airs of gentility and courteous manners, addressing his ruffians as "my good gentlemen," and referring to sordid acts such as kidnapping or arson as "that unpleasant little business" or "those unfortunate events." He refers to the characters as "guests" and expresses regret that he cannot provide suitable entertainment for their visit. Beneath his genteel demeanor, however, larno is just as thuggish and arrogant as any Redbrand outlaws.

If threatened, larno uses his staff of defense to cast mage armor on himself. He then casts offensive spells at enemies he can see.

Iarno&#39;s stat block contains a list of the spells he has prepared. For descriptions of those spells and their effects, see the rule book. larno uses the shield power of his staff for added protection.

If he is reduced to 8 or fewer hit points and has no avenues of escape, larno surrenders. He values his life more than anything, and he remains a model prisoner in the hopes that the Black Spider will somehow learn of his predicament and "arrange for his freedom."

If he is questioned while in captivity, larno relates the following information, all of which is true:

The Black Spider is a drow (dark elf).

The Black Spider sent three bugbears to help larno keep the population of Phandalin under control, but the Redbrands have managed without them.

The bugbears know the way to Wave Echo Cave, but larno does not.

The Black Spider is searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells. Dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver&#39;s Pact used the magical forge to fashion powerful magic item

No other members of the Lords&#39; Alliance know of Iarno&#39;s betrayal.

      <text>The goblin, Droop, is not a threat to the party. He has
been cowed by the bugbears and follows their orders until . someone stronger comes along. If he regains consciousness during combat, Droop hides and avoids the fight. He is such a coward that if he is ordered to fight, he does so with disadvantage (as explained in the rulebook).

Droop knows the general layout of the Redbrand hideout, as well as the location of its secret doors and traps. He doesn&#39;t think to offer up the information, but if prompted, he reveals as&#39; much as he can remember in an attempt to be useful to the party. Some of the details might be confusing or mixed up. He is a goblin, after all.
If the bugbears are dispatched, Droop tries to ingratiate himself with the party. He doesn&#39;t remember the route to Cragmaw Castle, but he knows it&#39;s up north, in the forest. He also knows that Cragmaw goblins patrol around Phandalin, and he suggests the characters might be able to capture a patrol to learn more about the castle.

Characters might be inclined to keep Droop around for a while. See the "NPC Party Members" sidebar (page 11) for advice on how to run Droop as a member of the party.</text>

Creatures that can&#39;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
	The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
	You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight five her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn&#39;t met before the spell expires, the activity isn&#39;t preformed.
	If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	
Paralyzed:
• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can&#39;t take actions or reactions, and can&#39;t move or speak.
	
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
	
• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

      <name>LMoP: Background</name>
      <text>More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver&#39;s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when ores swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.

A powerful force of ores reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern.

Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.

For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker brothers-a trio of dwarves- have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines.

Unfortunately for the Rockseekers, they are not the only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain known as the Black Spider controls a network of bandit gangs and goblin tribes in the area, and his agents have followed the Rockseekers to their prize. Now the Black Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he is taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is.</text>

      <text>The characters are in the city of Neverwinter when their dwarf patron and friend, Gundren Rockseeker, hires them to escort a wagon to Phandalin. Gundren has gone ahead with a warrior, Sildar Hallwinter, to attend to business in the town while the characters
follow with the supplies. The characters will be paid 10 gp each by the owner of Barthen&#39;s Provisions in Phandalin when they deliver the wagon safely to that trading post.

      <name>LMoP: Wilderness Encounters</name>
      <text>Ask the players to tell you the party&#39;s marching order, so that you know which characters are in the lead and who&#39;s bringing up the rear. When the party camps, ask which characters are on watch. This information is important if the party encounters something dangerous.

The Triboar Trail is not safe. As the adventurers travel throughout this area, they might stumble across hungry beasts, greedy bandits, or vicious monsters. Check for encounters once during the day and once at night by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17-20, an encounter takes place. Roll a d12 and consult the Wilderness Encounters table to determine what the party meets.

When an encounter occurs, and the adventurers gain XP if they defeat the monsters. Each creature&#39;s stat block has the XP value for one monster of that sort. Multiply that value by the number of creatures encountered, then divide the total equally among the characters.

Stirges, These flying predators drain the blood of their victims and are drawn to the light of campfires at night.

Ghouls. These undead humans hunger for living flesh.

Ogre. The ogre is looking for an easy kill. It is too stupid to flee once combat is joined.

Goblins. The goblins know the location of Cragmaw Castle and can provide directions if they are captured and threatened. Each one carries a pouch containing Id l.O cp.

Hobgoblins. This squad of hobgoblins is actively seeking the adventurers, hoping to collect on a bounty. They know the location of Cragmaw Castle but won&#39;t provide directions unless they are charmed. One hobgoblin carries a crudely drawn sketch of one party member, with "25 gold pieces for this one" and a symbol of a black spider drawn beneath it.

Ores. These scouts are part of the band currently based at Wyvern Tor. As they roam, they look for travelers to ambush or homesteads to burn.

Ow/bear. This hungry predator picks up the characters&#39; scent and pursues them relentlessly.</text>
