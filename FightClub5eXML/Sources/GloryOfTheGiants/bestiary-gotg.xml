      <text>The cradle conjures a vortex of wind at a point it can see within 90 feet of itself. The wind vortex is a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature other than the cradle in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 71 (11d12) bludgeoning damage and has the restrained condition within the vortex. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder. The vortex lasts until the start of the cradle's next turn. A creature with the restrained condition falls prone when the vortex ends.</text>
      <text>	A creature with the restrained condition can use its action to try to escape the vortex. The creature makes a DC 19 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, the creature escapes and moves 3d6 × 10 feet away from the vortex in a random direction.</text>

      <text>The scion inhales a vortex of air in a 120-foot line that is 15 feet wide. Each creature in that area that is Huge or smaller must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 120 feet straight toward the scion and be swallowed. A swallowed creature has the restrained condition, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the scion, and takes 24 (7d6) force damage at the start of each of the scion's turns.</text>
      <text>	The scion's stomach can hold up to two creatures at a time.

If the scion dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the restrained condition and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting with the prone condition.</text>
