        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Haunted</name>
        <text>Unlike many other sorcerers, the circumstances of your birth were mundane and you have no arcane inheritance passed down from strange ancestors. Instead, you gained your sorcerous powers after you managed to survive an experience that left you on the brink of death. Since that experience you've had a preternatural sense for danger and a ghostly companion that either can't or won't leave you alone. Some Haunted, as sorcerers who share your origin are called, develop cordial relationships with their phantom, while others find their spectral companion to be a relentless nuisance.

        <name>Haunted Spells (Haunted)</name>
        <text>You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Haunted Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
	When you cast a spell you know from the Haunted Spells table, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level.

Haunted Spells:
Sorcerer Level | Spell
1st | unseen servant
3rd | see invisibility

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Phantom Companion (Haunted)</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.
	When you cast the spell, you can only choose the form of a specter, which becomes your phantom companion. Instead of a celestial, fey, or fiend this familiar's creature type is undead.
	As an action, you can command your phantom companion to turn invisible until it attacks or you cast a spell through it. While invisible, it leaves no physical evidence of its passage, so it can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment or objects it is holding remains visible.
	Additionally, at 3rd level, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make its Life Drain attack with its reaction.

        <name>Strength of Spirit (Haunted)</name>
        <text>At 6th level, your bond to the specter summoned by your Phantom Companion feature empowers it further. You gain the following benefits:

	• Your specter's maximum hit points increase by four times your level in this class.

	• Your specter can deliver spells of any range, not just touch. Apart from this change, it follows all the normal rules of casting a spell through your familiar.

	• When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to command your specter to use its Life Drain attack against a creature within range of your choice.

        <text>Also at 6th level, you gain resistance to necrotic damage. In addition, when you cast a sorcerer spell that deals damage, you can choose to change the damage type dealt to necrotic.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Phantom Possession (Haunted)</name>
        <text>At 14th level, as an action you can direct your phantom companion to attempt to possess and enter a humanoid of your choice within 5 feet of your phantom. Creatures immune to the charmed condition are immune to this feature. When you do, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be possessed by your phantom for 1 minute. During this time your phantom cannot be affected by spells or abilities, take actions, or interact with in any way.
	While the target is possessed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are within 100 feet. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability, taking the Dodge action if it has not used its action already.
	Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Charisma saving throw against the possession. If the saving throw succeeds, the possession ends and your phantom companion reappears in the closest unoccupied space.
	Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.

        <name>Become Death (Haunted)</name>
        <text>At 18th level, you can transmute your physical form into a spectral one when you near death. When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you drop to 1 hit point instead and gain temporary hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. At the start of each of your turns, you lose 5 temporary hit points and all creatures of your choice within 30 feet take 5 necrotic damage. While you have any temporary hit points granted from this feature, you have resistance to all damage, a fly speed of 30 feet, and can move through creatures and objects provided you end your movement in an unoccupied space.
	Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Wretched Bloodline</name>
        <text>With every promise made to a fairy, contract signed with a devil, and pact with the unquiet dead, there's a chance someone doesn't keep their end of the bargain. The vengeance of immortal beings lasts much longer than one lifetime, and the lingering magic of these curses can affect the mortal's descendants.
	These inherited magical afflictions may manifest as a plague, deformity, or aversion to the sun. In such families, a child may be born that learns to master the latent magic within their inherited curse, turning their bloodline's bane into a personal boon — these sorcerers are known collectively as the Wretched.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Bad Luck Charm (Wretched Bloodline)</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you have mastered the ability to temporarily cast a small fragment of your curse onto another. You can use a bonus action to choose a creature you can see within 30 feet. The chosen creature has disadvantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 1 sorcery point to use it again.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Blood Ties (Wretched Bloodline)</name>
        <text>At 1st level, your senses easily attune to the supernatural forces that caused your inherited affliction. You know the detect evil and good spell and can cast it without expending a spell slot. This spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you but does not count against your number of spells known. Once you cast this spell without expending a spell slot, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
	In addition, choose one of the following creature types as the being who cursed your ancestor: fey, fiend, or undead. While you are concentrating on the detect evil and good spell, creatures of the chosen type have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you cannot be charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

        <name>Wretched Curse (Wretched Bloodline)</name>
        <text>Also at 1st level, you suffer from a curse inherited from an ancestor who failed to uphold their end of a bargain with an otherworldly power. Choose one of the following curses that was passed down to you.

Hulking. Your ancestor was cursed with a hulking frame. You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks made to move quietly. In addition, your maximum hit points increase by 1 and increase by 1 again each time you gain a level in this class. Finally, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

Nocturnal. Your ancestor was cursed to shun the light of day. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) ability checks made to see while you are in sunlight. In addition, you have darkvision out to a distance of 120 feet and can see through magical darkness within that range.

Plaguebearer. Your ancestor was cursed with physical symptoms of a plague. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) ability checks made against humanoid creatures who are not blinded. In addition, you are immune to disease and have resistance to necrotic damage.

        <text>At 6th level, you learn the bestow curse spell. This spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose to cast it by spending 3 sorcery points instead of a spell slot. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, its range changes to 60 feet for that casting and your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

        <name>Terrifying Visage (Wretched Bloodline)</name>
        <text>Beginning at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to adopt the terrifying visage of the being who cursed your ancestor for 10 minutes. During this time, you can use an action on each of your turns to cause each creature who can see you within 30 feet make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failure, a creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
	In addition, while you have adopted the terrifying visage, you gain an additional benefit based on the creature type chosen with your Blood Ties feature.

Fey. You can use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet in any direction.

Fiend. You have resistance to cold and fire damage.

Undead. When you take damage that isn't radiant, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by an amount equal to half your sorcerer level.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

        <text>Beginning at 18th level, your magic has become powerful enough that you can call and command a servant of those that cursed you. Choose one of the following creatures as a representative for your curse based on the choice you made with your Blood Ties feature: lamia or troll (fey only), barbed devil or incubus/ succubus (fiend only), ghost or wraith (undead only).
	You can use an action and spend 5 sorcery points to summon your chosen creature. The creature appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet, and disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, you use this feature to summon another creature, or after 10 minutes have passed.
	Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach.
