        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Pestilence (Grim Hollow)</name>
        <text>Clad in grime-soaked armor and wielding rusting weapons, the Oath of Pestilence paladin spreads corruption, disease, and filth. Bound by an oath which infests their bodies with all manner of plagues, these heralds of decay lumber forward with unholy toughness and grim resolve.

Tenets of Pestilence:
The tenets of the Oath of Pestilence emphasize the role of disease as a purifying element in the cycle of life.

Strength in Resilience. Surviving hardship and plague make you stronger. Spreading these things causes strength to flourish.

All Things Must Pass. Death is the natural conclusion of life. There is nothing unnatural or immoral about the ending of life.

Might Makes Right. The laws of mortals mean nothing to poxes and plagues, they go where they wish and take what they want. So should you.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Pestilence Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | bane, inflict wounds
5th | acid arrow, ray of enfeeblement
9th | flash fever*, stinking cloud
13th | blight, confusion
17th | contagion, insect plague

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Channel Divinity: Debilitating Fever (Oath of Pestilence (Grim Hollow))</name>
        <text>Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach that isn't a construct or undead. On a hit, the creature becomes diseased and is incapacitated for 1 minute. At the end of each of the diseased target's turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the target is no longer diseased, and the effect ends.
	Since this ability induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Entropic Infection (Oath of Pestilence (Grim Hollow))</name>
        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to weaken a creature against entropic energies. As an action, you can force a creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, for the next minute the creature takes an additional 2d6 damage the first time it takes necrotic damage each turn. During this time, the creature loses resistance to necrotic damage if it has it.

        <text>Starting at 7th level, you emit an aura of contagion and virulence to a range of 10 feet. When a creature within your aura makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you can give that roll disadvantage as a reaction.
	At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

        <text>At 15th level, when you take damage which would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can choose to expend any number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice and subtract the result from the damage taken. If this reduces the damage to 0, you don't take any damage.
	In addition, if you are killed your corpse violently explodes in a shower of pus and gore, dealing 8d6 necrotic damage to creatures within 20 feet of you that fail a Constitution saving throw.

        <text>At 20th level, you become an avatar of plague, which gives you the following benefits:

	• You have resistance to necrotic damage and are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.

	• Your hit point maximum can't be reduced.

Creatures of your choice who start their turn within 5 feet of you, or who move within 5 feet of you on their turn, take necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier. Once a creature takes damage from this ability, it can't take damage from it again until the start of its next turn.

    <!-- Sacred Oath: Oath of Zeal -->
    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Zeal</name>
        <text>The Oath of Zeal is taken by paladins consumed by hatred for a specific group or ideology. Zealots, as these paladins are sometimes called, pursue an inquisition against their enemies at all costs. They abandon compassion and honor as impediments to the more important work of ridding the world of those they deem dangerous or heretical.

Tenets of Zeal
The tenets of the Oath of Zeal are serious and severe, as are those paladins who choose to take them.

Uncover Corruption. Darkness cannot abide the light of day. Wickedness must be revealed before it can be destroyed.

Purge the Heretics. Heresy is a tumor that spread through the hearts of the innocent. Cut it out at the source.

No Mercy. The righteous path requires unwavering conviction and unflinching resolve.

By Any Means Necessary. There is no sacrifice too great when it comes to defeating the wicked.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Oath of Zeal Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | detect evil and good, hunter's mark
5th | detect thoughts, knock
9th | fear, tongues
