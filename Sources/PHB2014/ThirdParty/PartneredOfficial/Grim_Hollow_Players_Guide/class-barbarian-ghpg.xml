        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Fractured</name>
        <text>Barbarians are defined by their rage, channeling emotion to unleash brief but potent destruction on their enemies. A rare few study esoteric psychological techniques that split their rage off from the rest of their psyche, dividing their identity into two parts: ego and id. When their ego is in control, the Fractured — as these barbarians are known — are capable of a degree of self-control and cunning few other barbarians are. When they allow their id to take control, their countenance turns monstrous and their bodies swell with the power of rage made physically manifest.

        <name>Face of Rage (Path of the Fractured)</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, when you enter your rage, your features distort and your body swells such that your appearance completely changes. Creatures who don't witness your transformation and have not witnessed it in the past do not recognize you. In addition, while raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

	• You can roll a 1d8 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike, and your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

	• When you use the attack action with an unarmed strike and are not wielding a shield, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

	• You count as one size larger when determining who you can target and who can target you with grappling, and your reach with unarmed attacks increases to 10 feet.

        <text>At 14th level, when you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to drop to 1 hit point instead and gain temporary hit points equal to half your maximum hit points.

You lose all remaining temporary hit points after 1 minute.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Primal Spirit</name>
        <text>Many barbarians are in tune with the natural world, but few are as mystically intertwined with it as those who walk the Path of the Primal Spirit. These barbarians forge powerful connections with the beasts and natural spirits of the world, inspiring such ethereal beings to manifest and journey with them on far-flung adventures.
	Barbarians who follow this path have a deep reverence for the ecological cycle of the natural world. Such barbarians are as likely to accept quests and pleas for aid from local wildlife as they are other humanoids. This respect for animals doesn't cross into naivety - no barbarian better understands the circle of life and the delicate balance between the needs of predator and prey better than those who walk the Path of the Primal Spirit.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Primal Companion (Path of the Primal Spirit)</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you gain a primal companion, a spirit that accompanies you on your adventures and instinctively fights alongside you. Select either the Guardian or Striker, and one of land, sea, or sky. Its in-game statistics found in the bestiary as "Primal Guardian" and "Primal Striker", which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.
	You determine your companion's appearance; however, this does not affect its game statistics. Despite taking on a physical form, your primal companion does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep. You and your primal companion can communicate with one another telepathically while you are both on the same plane.
	As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your primal companion or summon it within 30 feet of you. In combat, your primal companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, your companion can take any action of its choice.
	You can spend one minute per short rest caring for your primal companion. When you do, the spirit regains 2d6 hit points. Your primal companion regains all lost hit points at the end of a long rest. If your primal companion dies, the spirit manifests in a form of your choice the next time you finish a long rest.

        <name>Skinrider's Trance (Path of the Primal Spirit)</name>
        <text>At 10th level, you can use an action and choose your primal companion or one beast currently under the effect of your animal friendship spell to enter a trance. For the duration of this trance, you possess the chosen creature.
	While possessing a creature, you sense the world through the target's senses, you have total control over its movement and actions, you use the beast's physical statistics and abilities instead of your own, and keep your mental attributes. This possession ends if you choose to exit the trance (no action required by you), the beast you're possessing is reduced to 0 hit points, or you and the beast are on different planes of existence.
	While in this trance, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own senses and cannot move or take actions. You can remain in the trance for a number of hours up to half your level in this class + your Constitution modifier. Once you use this feature to enter the trance, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
