      <name>Description</name>
      <text>On the fringes of the civilized world, parents warn their children not to wander away from their homes, especially at night. The many creatures that haunt the forests, from the faerie-folk to the minions of the Great Beast, spell doom for the innocent who stray too far into the darkness.
	You failed to heed your parents' warnings, and you were taken. In fact, those who know of your experience use that word to describe you: Taken. You do not remember what happened to you while you were away, but through some mysterious and possibly fortunate circumstances, you wandered back into town after months or years of going missing. Maybe the fairies whisked you off to some magical realm. Maybe evil cultists of an Arch Daemon held you prisoner, planning to sacrifice you to their dark leader when the time was right, and you found a way to escape. Maybe one of the Beast's warped and feral minions took a liking to you and kept you as a pet. Whatever your story, you can't remember your time away. But that doesn't mean you weren't changed by it.

      <text>While you don't remember your time away from the civilized world, you occasionally have glimpses of what happened. When you are making an ability check to know or remember something about a monster or some other piece of lore, you can reroll a check that gave you no information. If the new check provides information, you cannot use this ability again until you gain a level. This represents your subconscious mind reminding you of details you witnessed while you were lost.</text>

d6 | Personality Trait
1 | I am easily startled, jumping at the slightest sound.

d6 | Ideal
1 | Innocents need protection. I won't let what happened to me happen to others.
2 | That which does not kill you makes you stronger. Conflict begets strength.
3 | The world is a cruel place. In the end we are all ground down to dust.

5 | The only way to avoid being a victim is to be the aggressor.

3 | While others shunned you on your return, your pet never left your side. This unusually long-lived pet means the world to you.
4 | When you returned, the community rallied around you to care for you. You guard that community fiercely.

6 | A faerie grove in the forest near you is the only place where you are truly at peace.

d6 | Flaw
1 | I suffer nightmares that I cannot recall when I wake, and the lack of sleep makes me prone to fits of anger.
2 | I seek money and power regardless of the cost to my soul.
3 | I am rude to others as I tend to speak what's on my mind rather than filtering myself.
4 | My quest for justice sometimes interferes with my common sense.
5 | I am indifferent to the suffering of others.

      <text>When you fell ill with the Weeping Pox, you assumed you would die from it, as had so many before you. Your neighbors shunned you, fearing that you would spread the disease to them and their families.
	Then a miracle happened. A stranger came to you and offered to help. The stranger brought forth strange medicines, providing you with curative draughts and elixirs. And just as the disease reached its worst stages, the symptoms began to vanish. Before long, you were cured of the disease. The sores and scars of the disease, however, still play across your body - an unsubtle reminder of the terrible scourge you faced.
	The stranger left you after the treatments concluded, but you retained some of the knowledge that the healer used while caring for you. Those who marvel at your recovery also fear you: they harbor some suspicion that you made deals with dark powers to drive away the disease.

      <text>Your dramatic and sudden recovery from the Weeping Pox -as well as the physical changes to your appearance because of the disease - has made you a marvel to the people around you. Though you may be treated differently as a strange oddity, your new status does have potential perks. You can ask for small favors, from meals to places to rest, and find the common folks willing to oblige, even if they are slightly afraid of you.</text>

3 | Knowledge is the key to defeating any problem.
4 | Discipline and rigor are the best tools against the chaos of the world.
5 | Self-reliance is the key to survival. Others may let you down.

d6 | Bond
1 | I do what I do for all those suffering from horrible maladies. They deserve respect, empathy, and assistance.
2 | The book of cures that my doctor left me is incomprehensible to me, but I carry it with me everywhere.

3 | I'm easily distracted.
4 | When innocent people are being hurt, I fly into a blind rage that's hard to control.
5 | Since the Weeping Pox could not kill me, I'm obviously indestructible.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You spent years traveling the countryside as a member of the Arcanist Inquisition, seeking out heretics and blasphemers, daemon and arcanist. Your work uncovered hidden evil that likely saved the lives of countless innocents. However, on more than one occasion the zeal of yourself or others brought low individuals who were themselves innocent.
	After a crisis of conscience, you left the ranks of the inquisitors. Leaving those ranks is itself a dangerous prospect, but you could no longer abide. Maybe someone you love and care for starting showing arcane affinities that would have led to their destruction. Maybe you did. Maybe the last investigation you performed opened your eyes to new realities.
	Now you are living with a target on your back. Your former peers don't take kindly to people leaving their ranks. Those whom you persecuted have not forgotten your deeds. But life must still be lived, and there's more than one way to find and destroy the evil in the world.

4 | I believe that my enemies are waiting around every corner.
5 | When I get tense, I like to dance and pray to relieve the tension.
6 | No matter what you've seen or done, I can top that.

d6 | Ideal
1 | The arcane is dangerous and evil, but it must be conquered with compassion rather than violence.
2 | The unexamined life is a blessing that should not be overlooked... or overanalyzed
3 | Life is too short to not live it to its fullest.
4 | Progress is an arch daemon's playground.
5 | Nothing means anything. Life is futile and uncaring.
6 | Children are the only ones who can make the world right.

d6 | Bond
1 | The person who made me see the error in my inquisitioning ways keeps me grounded.
2 | My old amulet of office never leaves my neck, a reminder of what I was and what I can never become again.
3 | I adopted the pet of one of my former victims. I care for it as penance for all the lives I destroyed.
4 | My former assistant left the Inquisition with me, and I feel beholden to lead them on a better path.
5 | The spirit of someone who died at my hands has become my friend and confessor.
6 | Although I have left the Inquisition, my former mentor still holds an important place in my heart.

When you are lost, or in need of food or water, or trying to build a fire or a makeshift shelter, there's a 50% chance that you gain assistance from a creature of the wild.

Holdings:
	• A spot in an alley that you have managed to stake out and must defend against newcomers.

Gain the friendship of a local business owner by performing odd jobs or doing some other service.</text>

By this time you have established a begging "pitch" designed to attract attention without inconveniencing those passing by. This could be a persona or some sort of script that you devise in order to amuse or elicit sympathy from the general populace.

Holdings:
	• A safe place to sleep near a merchant stall or building.

      <name>Rank 3 - Gutter Baron</name>
      <text>You have risen to a position of prominence, such as it is, among the beggars in your city. You are able to direct the actions of a number of other paupers and split the rewards in a far more efficient manner than they could do alone, and they respect and defer to you in important decisions.

Holdings:
	• Squatter's rights in an abandoned building.
	• A handful of other beggars who defer to your authority and aid you in gathering money and information.
	• Knowledge of an illicit deal that took place in an alley in the dead of night, which implicates a minor noble.

Perform a great service for the poor of the city either by thwarting the plans of a ranking noble or leveraging your influence to gain a powerful aristocrat patron.</text>

      <text>Those paupers who choose to leave their past behind and take to the open road are known as vagabonds. Some do so in an attempt to flee whatever painful memories caused their descent into poverty, while others hold out hope of starting a new life in another city. Most don't survive outside the protective walls of a guarded settlement, but those that do often find little welcome in the cities they visit. Vagabonds must therefore work hard to gain trust and forge what connections they may have in each place they visit, and invariably they must move on before they wear out their welcome.

      <name>Friendly Face</name>
      <text>Upon spending an hour in a town or other settlement and making a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check, you can track down an ally that you made on a previous visit during your wandering. This ally begins as friendly to you and will answer questions you have regarding the town, its services, and its inhabitants.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Rank 1 - Outcast</name>
      <text>For whatever reason, you can't go home again. Bereft of family, property, and support, you are now cut loose to wander and survive as best you can. You stand out more as a stranger in smaller settlements, where people shun you as if you have the plague, but even in larger cities you are viewed with suspicion by the local authorities.

Holdings:
	• A tarnished compass.
	• A posting from a town seeking able-bodied workers to deal with a recent disaster.

Survive a major storm on the road or participate meaningfully in a town's internal disputes.</text>

Play a major role in the downfall of a prominent member of society.</text>

      <text>Unterland was the first of the provinces to host blood sport arenas, back in the days before the formation of the Bürach Empire. Since then the practice has been driven underground, but, like poison spreading silently throughout a healthy body, it has infiltrated nearly every major city.
	Ostensibly illegal, you can almost always find small groups of desperate individuals putting their lives on the line for the amusement and enrichment of others. This hidden network of arenas has recently organized into the self-proclaimed Fighter's Guild and developed a series of coded phrases and symbols to identify its members. Following the unspoken rule of Etharis, it is a place where only the strong survive.

      <text>The major kingdoms of Etharis are far from the only bastions of culture to stand against the current darkness. From the frozen north to the Gulf of Lions, numerous tribes have chosen to keep to their traditional lifestyle, living in harmony with the spirits of the wild. Where hunting and gathering aren't sufficient to support their population, many have turned to raiding the more "civilized" regions. This has garnered the tribes a reputation as barbarians and savages, but this ignores a rich history and a deep, abiding respect for nature.
	Clan members are generally more at home traveling through the wilds than their urban counterparts. Their close ties with nature and the spirits of the wild also gives them a unique perspective on many problems, and they are less quick to condemn things they are unfamiliar with. Those that leave the tribe often make good guides, trackers, and mercenaries.

	• Skill Proficiency: Choose one from Athletics, History, Nature, Perception, Religion, or Survival.
	• Languages: Choose one standard language.
