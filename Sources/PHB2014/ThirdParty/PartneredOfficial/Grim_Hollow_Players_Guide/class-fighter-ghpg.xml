        <text>Fighters who become Living Crucibles have discovered an external means of power. While most other fighters train in martial traditions or study the art of war, Living Crucibles hone their craft of alchemy and prepare their body to endure compounds poisonous to others. In exchange for this rigorous physical and mental preparation, these fighters are able to temporarily push their bodies past their natural limits. Under the influence of their alchemical compounds these fighters can see in darkness, enhance their speed, inure themselves to magical attacks, and more.

        <name>Compound Creator (Living Crucible)</name>
        <text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to create alchemical compounds toxic to others but empowering to you.

Creating Compounds. You learn three compounds of your choice, which are detailed under the "Fighter (Living Crucible): Compounds" spell list. You can create any number of these compounds you know by using alchemist's supplies and spending 10 minutes to create them. These compounds remain potent until the end of your next long rest, after which time they become inert and have no effect.
	You learn two additional compounds of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new compounds, you can also replace one compound you know with another one.

Consuming Compounds. As a bonus action you can consume a single compound using this feature. You can safely consume a number of compounds up to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). Each compound you consume after that causes you to gain a level of exhaustion. When you finish a long rest, you regain the ability to safely consume compounds. You can benefit from multiple compounds at the same time, but taking the same compound more than once provides no additional effects.
	The benefits associated with each compound apply only to you. Any other creature that consumes one of your compounds must succeed on a Constitution saving throw DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or become poisoned for 1 minute.
