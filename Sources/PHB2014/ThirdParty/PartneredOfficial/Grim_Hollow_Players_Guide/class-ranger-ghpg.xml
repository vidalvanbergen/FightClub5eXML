        <name>Ranger Archetype: Green Reaper</name>
        <text>Green Reapers specialize in a school of assassination that specializes in harvesting and catalyzing the toxic elements of flora and fauna. These rangers often work as killers for hire utilizing their extensive knowledge of toxins to end their marks lives discreetly or with gory panache, depending on the poison used and the client's wishes. Green Reapers exhibit a morbid curiosity when encountering a toxic substance they're unfamiliar with, typically followed by an enthusiastic application of the toxin on the next foe they encounter.

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Green Reaper Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

Green Reaper Spells:
Ranger Level | Spell
3rd | detect poison and disease
5th | hold person
9th | bestow curse
13th | greater invisibility
17th | cloudkill

        <name>Envenomed Attack (Green Reaper)</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you can use your poisoner's kit as a bonus action to coat a weapon or up to 20 pieces of ammunition with a dose of toxic poison. For the next minute, each time you deal damage with the weapon or ammunition, you deal an additional 1d4 poison damage. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and expended uses of this feature are recovered at the end of a long rest.
	At 11th level, this additional damage increases to 2d4. Also, the expended uses of this feature are recovered at the end of a short or long rest.

        <text>Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with poisoner's kits. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that uses this proficiency. Additionally, when you gain this feature, you also gain a poisoner's kit. If you ever lose this kit, you can spend 8 hours creating a replacement by collecting toxic flora and harvesting venomous fauna.
	As a final benefit of this feature, once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon or ammunition enhanced by your Envenomed Attack feature, you can spend a spell slot to apply a magical toxin to the attack. The toxin deals an additional 1d6 poison damage and the creature is poisoned until the end of your next turn. The toxin has additional effects based on the spell slot expended casting the spell. These additional effects are detailed at the end of this description under Toxin Effects, and they last to the end of your next turn unless otherwise noted in the description.

Toxin Effects:
1st-Level Effects:
When you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.

Attenuate. While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

Befuddled. While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it cannot speak, read, or write any language and it has disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells.

Uncoordinated. While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it cannot take reactions or the Disengage or Dodge action.

2nd-Level Effects:
When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.

Debilitate. The creature can't regain hit points for the next minute.

Potent. If the creature has resistance to poison damage, it loses that resistance for the next minute.

Suffer. For the next minute, the first time the creature takes poison damage each turn it takes an additional 1d6 poison damage.

3rd-Level Effects:
When you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.

Lingering. Instead of ending at the end of your next turn, the creature continues to be poisoned for 10 minutes. At the end of each of the creature's turns it can make a Constitution saving throw using your ranger spell save DC. If the creature accumulates three successes, which do not have to be consecutive, the poisoned condition ends early.

Supernatural. When you deal damage with a weapon attack that has been dosed with this toxin, the creature loses immunity to the poisoned condition if it has such an immunity. In addition, instead of ending at the end of your next turn, the creature continues to be poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns it can make a Constitution saving throw using your ranger spell save DC, ending the condition on a success.

4th-Level Effects:
When you expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.

Flesh Eating. While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

Insensate. While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it is also blinded and deafened.

Paraplegia. While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, its movement speeds become 0 and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

5th-Level Effects:
When you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.

Enhanced. Choose an option for this toxin off of the 4th level effects list an additional option off of the 1st or 2nd level effects list.

Stinging Application. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack that used this toxin, the attack deals an additional 5d6 damage. This additional damage's type is your choice of acid, necrotic, or poison.

        <name>Ranger Archetype: Vermin Lord</name>
        <text>Vermin Lords cultivate loyal hordes of disease-bearing rodents to help them in their efforts to stem a greater evil. For many of these rangers, that greater evil is some kind of societal ill, but a rare few see their fellow humanoids as an infestation that threatens the natural world. Regardless of their goal, they make their homes in sewers, slums, and other forgotten places, where they are free to plot against their enemies and tend to their vermin kin.

        <text>At 3rd level, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with vermin (mice, rats, and other rodents determined by your DM).
	Additionally, you can use an action and expend a spell slot to summon rodent hordes. When you do, you summon a number of swarms of vermin equal to the level of spell slot expended. Each swarm is summoned to a space you can see within 30 feet. This feature recharges after a short or long rest.
	Swarms summoned in this way go on your initiative, starting on your next turn. These swarms obey your verbal commands (no action required by you), defending themselves by taking the Dodge action if you do not give them a command. Your vermin swarms flee the area and disperse after 1 minute.
