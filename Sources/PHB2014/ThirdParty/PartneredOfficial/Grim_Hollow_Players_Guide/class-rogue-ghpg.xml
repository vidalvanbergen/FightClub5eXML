        <text>Stalking the backroads, the Highway Rider strikes fear into the heart of every traveler and penny-pinching merchant. They run down their prize astride a swift and loyal steed — and then make a quick getaway.

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with blackpowder pistols. Also, when you roll for initiative, you can immediately use your reaction to take one of the following actions:

	• Make one weapon attack with advantage
	• Move your speed, or your mount's speed, without provoking opportunity attacks
	• Take the Dodge action
	• Interact with an object or use an item

        <text>Also at 3rd level, you gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack: you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you or your mount moved at least 20 feet this turn, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply.

        <name>Roguish Archetype: Misfortune Bringer</name>
        <text>You've matched your penchant for illicit activities with the ability to mark your enemies for mishaps and misfortune. Whether your mother was a hag, you were imbued with magical powers by spending time among the fey, or you learned the art of cursing from a long line of hedge wizards before you, you are a Misfortune Bringer. Although not universal, many Misfortune Bringers have eyes of two different colors, using only one when glaring at the targets they intend to curse.

        <name>Evil Eye (Misfortune Bringer)</name>
        <text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to place a minor curse on others with a glance. As a bonus action on your turn, choose a creature you can see within 60 feet. The chosen creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your misfortune save DC or be marked by your evil eye. While a creature is marked by your evil eye, you can use your Sneak Attack against the creature even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.
	The creature remains marked by your evil eye for 1 minute or until you mark a different creature with your evil eye, whichever comes first.

        <name>Misfortunist (Misfortune Bringer)</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, you learn misfortunes that you can inflict on those marked by your evil eye.

Misfortunes. You learn two misfortunes of your choice, which are detailed under "Rogue (Misfortune Bringer): Misfortunes" spell list. You learn an additional misfortune of your choice at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Each time you finish a long rest, you can replace one misfortune you know with a different one.

Jinx Points. You have four jinx points. When you spend a jinx point, it is no longer available to you until you regain it. You regain all spent jinx points when you finish a short or long rest.
	You gain two additional jinx points at 13th level.

Saving Throws. Your evil eye, and some of your misfortunes, require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Misfortune save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
