        <text>Even the most benevolent divine beings operate outside the bounds of mortal comprehension. These eldritch forces sing a siren song that calls out for mortal worshippers through lucid dreams and the whispers of dead gods. The Eldritch domain empowers the devoted followers of unknown and distant forces of chaos, divine entities of eldritch oblivion, and dead gods.

        <name>Unpredictable Inspiration (Eldritch Domain)</name>
        <text>At 1st level, choose any cantrip. The chosen cantrip counts as a cleric spell for you but does not count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. Each time you finish a long rest you can replace the chosen cantrip with any other cantrip of your choice.
	In addition, you gain proficiency in a skill of your choice. Each time you finish a long rest you can replace the chosen skill with another skill of your choice.

        <name>Eldritch Contagion (Eldritch Domain)</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you've been gifted with the ability to impart a fleeting taste of the unknowable on others. When you cast a spell with a spell slot of 1st level or higher that targets one or more creatures, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to force one of the spell's targets to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, roll on the Eldritch Effects table and the creature suffers that effect for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. This effect ends early if you use this feature again.

Eldritch Effects:
d8 | Effect
1 | The creature cannot speak or cast spells that have verbal components.
2 | The creature takes 1d8 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns
3 | The creature is disoriented. It immediately falls prone and falls prone again at the end of each turn it moves 5 feet or more.
4 | The creature is distracted by visions and voices and has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) ability checks.
5 | The creature is unsure of itself. It can move or take an action on its turn but not both and it cannot use reactions.
6 | The creature is reckless. It has advantage on attack rolls and attack rolls against it have advantage.
7 | The creature is deafened and cannot see objects or creatures further than 30 feet away.
8 | The creature is frightened of you.

        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to speak a prophecy, inducing visions and hallucinations in nearby creatures.
	As an action, choose a point within 120 feet of you that you can see and roll on the Eldritch Effects table. Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the chosen point must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer the temporary effect for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the temporary effect on a success.

	Additionally, any creature that attempts to read your thoughts finds them incomprehensible. The attempt automatically fails and they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your cleric spell save DC or take psychic damage equal to your cleric level.

        <name>Divine Domain: Inquisition Domain (Grim Hollow)</name>
        <text>The Inquisition domain reflects the order of the multiverse and the rejection of tainted magic â€” at least so far as certain celestial powers see it. Only the divine casters are pure and fit for use. Since arcane magic is strong enough to challenge the gods, divine beings of this domain, such as the Arch Seraph Empyreus, demand magic-using mortals are kept in check. Most zealots root out all arcanists, while some strike fragile truces when complete removal isn't feasible.

Inquisition Domain Spells
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | detect magic, identify
3rd | see invisibility, silence
5th | dispel magic, remove curse
7th | arcane eye, locate creature
9th | creation, hallow

        <name>Witch Hunter's Strike (Inquisition Domain (Grim Hollow))</name>
        <text>At 1st level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an additional 1d8 force damage.
	If the creature is concentrating on a spell, you deal an additional 2d8 force damage instead. If a creature fails its saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of taking damage from this feature, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the extra force damage dealt by this attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), regaining all uses upon completion of a long rest.
	At 14th level, this damage increases to 2d8, and 3d8 if the creature is concentrating on a spell.

        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bestow a temporary resilience to arcane harm.
	As a bonus action, you present your holy symbol and choose a creature you can see (including yourself within 30 feet. The chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your cleric level. While a creature has temporary hit points granted by your spell shield, it has resistance to damage from spells and advantage on saving throws against spells. The creature loses any remaining temporary hit points after 1 hour.

On a failure, the creature takes force damage equal to 1d8 per level of spell slot expended casting the spell + your Wisdom modifier. Cantrips are considered first-level spells for this ability. On a successful save the creature takes half as much damage instead.
