        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Pride</name>
        <text>Monks of the Way of Pride value themselves above all others. These monks focus on mastering their form, ego, and destructive power. They use their monastic traditions publicly, with the intention of gaining the respect and admiration of "lesser beings."
The prideful traditions of this order include adorning oneself with jewelry, hiding their scars from prying eyes, and commanding respect from those that would oppose them.

Whenever you expend a ki point, you can also choose to gain temporary hit points equal to your Proficiency Bonus. While your current hit points are equal to or less than half your maximum hit points, you can also add your Wisdom modifier to the amount of temporary hit points gained.

        <text>At 3rd level, while your current hit points are equal to or less than half your maximum hit points, your Martial Arts die counts as being one higher than normal.

        <name>Irrational Retaliation (Way of Pride)</name>
        <text>Beginning at 6th level, damage dealt to you is damage dealt to your pride, and that is something you simply cannot allow. Whenever a creature deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to expend 2 ki points to target that creature. Until the end of your next turn, all attacks you make against the target creature have advantage.

        <text>At 11th level, your muscle memory takes over.

At the beginning of each of your turns whilst in this state you can spend 1 ki point to remain in this state. If you do not spend a ki point at the start of your turn whilst at 0 hit points you suffer all the normal effects of being reduced to 0 hit points.
	The following also apply:

	• You cannot speak.
	• You cannot cast or concentrate on spells.
	• Critical hits against you in this state count as one failed death saving throw instead of 2.

        <name>Psionic Prowess (Way of the Leaden Crown)</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, your psychic powers have manifested in the ability to cast certain spells. You gain the mage hand cantrip if you don't already know it. When you cast the spell, the spectral hand is invisible.
	In addition, you can cast certain spells by expending ki. You can use an action and spend 1 ki point to cast detect evil and good or protection from evil and good.

        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Leaden Crown</name>
        <text>In contrast to the esoteric ideals of other monastic traditions, monks of the Way of the Leaden Crown have practical aims: the self-governance of humanoid peoples. These monks see the history of the world as a series of clashes between groups of powerful beings, where humanoids were at best collateral damage and at worst disposable pawns. To break this cycle of dependence and destruction, monks of the Way of the Leaden Crown master mental powers to fight back against the otherworldly powers of the multiverse and protect humanoid sovereignty.
	One component of this plan involves training to do battle with powerful outsiders. The other equally important component is ensuring that humanoid societies are prepared to overthrow those powerful outsiders already dominating them. To that end, these monks seek political positions that place them in or near decision-making roles where they can influence humanoids to fight back against arch seraphs, arch daemons, and primordials.

        <name>Subtle Hand (Way of the Leaden Crown)</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, your martial arts are enhanced by a capacity for telekinetic strikes. On your turn your reach is 10 feet when you make unarmed attacks. In addition, when you make an unarmed strike this way, it deals force damage instead.

        <text>At 6th level, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw against your ki save DC. On a failure, you can choose to push or pull the creature 10 feet. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until the start of your next turn.

        <name>Psychic Crush (Way of the Leaden Crown)</name>
        <text>Starting at 11th level, each time you hit a creature with an unarmed strike it gains a pressure point. A creature loses all pressure points if you give a different creature a pressure point or 1 minute after the last time it gained a pressure point. As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to telekinetically crush a creature with 1 or more of your pressure points.
	When you do, the creature must make a Strength saving throw against your ki save DC. On a failure, the creature takes 1d8 force damage per pressure point they have and they are restrained until the end of your next turn. On a success, they take half as much damage and aren't restrained. Either way, the creature then loses all pressure points.
