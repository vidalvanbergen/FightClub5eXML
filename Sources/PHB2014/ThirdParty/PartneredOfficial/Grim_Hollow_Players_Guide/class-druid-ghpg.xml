        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of Blood</name>
        <text>The Circle of Blood is a keeper of old ways. They remember how ancient druids performed sacrificial rituals under a blood-red moon to appease the uncaring forces of nature. The Circle of Blood druid trades blood for life in a delicate balance to bolster their allies and destroy their enemies.

        <text>At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Blood Spells table.
	Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

        <text>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to claim the last vestiges of its vitality. You regain one previously spent Hit Die. When you do, you can grant a creature you can see within 60 feet of you a number of temporary hit points equal to your druid level.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining all expended uses at the end of a long rest.

        <name>Rite of the Blood Moon (Circle of Blood)</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you learn a rite that invokes the power within a creature's blood. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape class feature to drive yourself or a willing creature within 5 feet of you into a blood frenzy which lasts for 1 minute. The affected creature gains the following benefits:

	• It gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage against weapons which are not magical.

	• It gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet and advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

	• It can roll a d8 in place of the normal damage of its unarmed strike. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make one attack with its unarmed strike as a bonus action.

	• Its speed increases by 10 feet.

	• It can't speak or cast spells.

Only one creature at a time can be affected by your Blood Rite. If you use the Rite of the Blood Moon on another creature, the effects of the Rite end for any other creature.

        <text>Starting at 14th level, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to fully exsanguinate its corpse, conjuring a water elemental composed of its blood and bound to your service.
	Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands. The elemental remains in your service for 1 hour or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it collapses into a pool of blood.
	Once you conjure an elemental with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of Mutation</name>
        <text>Druids of the Circle of Mutation believe that nature should be improved in order to compete with the unnatural world. Their order hides in the darkest corners of swamps and forests, conducting experiments to warp the structure of their domain. They go unheard from for months on end, emerging from the wild with twisted vines and mutated creatures at their side. These druids have earned the scorn of other circles, discredited as those who have lost their way. In the eyes of a mutation druid, those who wish to preserve nature as it is simply fear what change brings.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Mutate Shape (Circle of Mutation)</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action to use your Wild Shape.
	In addition, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend a spell slot and gain a number of mutation points equal to the level of the spell slot expended. These mutation points last until they are spent or your use of Wild Shape ends. While you are in your beast shape you can expend one or more mutation points (no action required by you) to select a mutation from the list below. When you do, your physical body contorts and changes in a gruesome display. Chosen mutations last for the duration of your Wild Shape.

Creature of the Sea. For 1 mutation point, you can breathe air and water and gain a swim speed of 30 feet. For an additional 1 mutation point, your swim speed increases to 60 feet.

Creature of the Sky. For 3 mutation points, you gain a fly speed of 30 feet. For an additional 2 mutation points, your fly speed increases to 60 feet.

Darkvision. For 1 mutation point, you gain darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet.

Echolocation. For 4 mutation points, you have blindsight out to a distance of 30 feet while you are not deafened.

Enchanted Attacks. For 1 mutation point, your attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Enlarge. For 1 mutation point, your size increases by one step (from Medium to Large, for example. You can spend an additional 2 mutation points to increase your size by two steps instead (from Medium to Huge, for example).

Multiattack. For a number of mutation points equal to 2 + 2 x your beast form's CR, whenever you use your action to make a natural weapon attack, you can make two natural weapon attacks instead. Creatures that already have multiattack can take one additional natural weapon attack.

Natural Armor. For 1, 2, or 3 mutation points you increase your AC by an equal amount.

Reduce. For 1 mutation point, your size decreases by one step (from Medium to Small, for example). You can spend an additional 2 mutation points to decrease your size by two steps instead (from Medium to Tiny, for example).

Unnatural Voice. For 1 mutation point, you can speak as normal, even if your beast shape lacks the anatomy for such vocalizations. This does not allow for spellcasting while in Wild Shape form.

Venomous Attacks. For 2 mutation points, attacks you make with your natural weapons deal an additional 1d4 poison damage.

        <text>Also at 2nd level, your ability to transform into dangerous beasts is enhanced. Starting when you gain this feature, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating 1 or lower. You ignore the Max CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there.
	Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a challenge rating equal to or less than your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

        <name>Endless Evolution (Circle of Mutation)</name>
        <text>At 10th level, when you enter your Wild Shape you gain a number of mutation points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Unspent mutation points are lost when you leave your beast shape.
	In addition, you can use an action to touch a beast and expend a spell slot, causing it to mutate to your liking. You gain a number of mutation points equal to the level of the spell slot or the CR of the beast, whichever is lower. As part of the same action, you must spend all mutation points on mutations which manifest in the beast. Unspent mutation points are lost. Mutations remain indefinitely until the same beast is targeted by a different use of this feature or the dispel magic spell, remove curse spell, or similar magic.

        <name>Apex Predator Aura (Circle of Mutation)</name>
        <text>Starting at 14th level, beasts that begin their turn within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to your druid spell save. On a failure, the creature is frightened for 10 minutes. On a success, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. An affected creature can use its action on each subsequent turn to steel themselves and repeat the saving throw, ending and becoming immune to this fear effect for the next 24 hours on a success.
	You can use an action to cause this aura to affect chosen creatures within 30 feet, instead of only beasts, until the start of your next turn. Once you use this special action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
