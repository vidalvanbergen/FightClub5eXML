    <text>The blades of this axe smolder with an inner light. The dark wooden handle is accented with silver.
	When the celestial realm turned back yet another assault from the forces of evil, a fiendish forge master received a vision, allowing them to craft a battleaxe like no other. With the might of Ardor, the fiends now possess a weapon capable of striking down the celestial forces.
	Ardor now lies in the fiendish realm's hidden vaults, waiting to be wielded when the forces of darkness make their ultimate strike to consume the world. The fiends don't realize that an equally powerful weapon rests in the hands of the celestials who wage eternal war against them. The fates who inspired the forge master to craft Ardor also sent a vision to a smith of heaven in the interest of maintaining the balance of power.

Axe of Hell. This magic battleaxe grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra 3d10 necrotic damage.

Champion of Evil. While holding the battleaxe, you are immune to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned conditions.

Ardor's Pursuit. As a bonus action, you can release Ardor to hover magically in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you can see the battleaxe, you can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one attack against a target or return to your hands. If any effect targets the hovering axe, you are considered to be holding it. The hovering axe falls if the attuned user dies.

Spells. While the axe is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18): bane, banishment, bestow curse, branding smite, or incendiary cloud. Once you use the axe to cast a spell, that spell can't be cast again from it until the next dawn.

Destroying the Axe. The only thing capable of damaging the battleaxe is its celestial twin Zeal. A creature wielding Zeal can choose to attack Ardor, which has an AC of 21 and 300 HP. No other creature or object can damage Ardor.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this item to become quadrupedal, for instance.
	During the hour the mask is activated, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way. While altered in this manner, your hideous appearance is concealed. Once you use the mask, you cannot do so again until the following dawn.

    <text>This ebony staff bears a bronze spear tip and additional blades carved to depict a winged scarab. The staff can be wielded as a magic spear that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. You are considered proficient with this weapon while you are attuned to it, even if you aren't proficient with spears. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

Cull Subjects. Humanoids roll at disadvantage to save against spells you cast while attuned to the staff.

Spell Shield. While attuned to this staff, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you.

Cursed. This staff is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the staff, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.
	While you are attuned to the staff, once a day at midnight, you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, your maximum hit points are reduced by 10 unless you are undead. These hit points can only be restored by means of a wish spell. If your maximum hit points are reduced to 0 in this way, you die and immediately rise as a wight.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Arcane Focus: An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.

The rod can be held in the teeth and is usable in your hybrid or kindred form. You transform each target into a wolf or a bear (your lycanthrope heritage determines which).
	The transformation lasts for 24 hours for each target, until you choose to end the effect, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. A target's game statistics are replaced by the chosen beast's statistics, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.
	The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from its equipment.
	Once the rod has been used in this way, it cannot be used again until the following dawn.

    <text>This white wooden bow is set with four gemstones: a ruby, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. When you hold this bow, you can summon a magical arrow composed of one of the four elements. Conjuring an arrow in this way does not require an action. Each time you summon an arrow, you must choose one of the four options below. If you do not fire the arrow within 1 minute of summoning it, it dissolves.

Arrow of Air. On a hit, the arrow of air deals 2d8 lightning damage.

Arrow of Earth. On a hit, the arrow of earth deals 2d8 magical bludgeoning damage.

Arrow of Fire. On a hit, the arrow of fire deals 2d8 fire damage.

Arrow of Water. On a hit, the arrow of water deals 2d8 cold damage.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

When you do so, loose stone, soil, and minerals are immediately pulled to the surface of the armor, granting you a +1 bonus to AC but reducing your speed by 5 feet. You can use a bonus action to activate this property each round cumulatively, up to a maximum of +5 AC and a 25-foot reduction in speed.
	If 1 minute passes without using a bonus action to activate this property, all magnetized material falls off the armor, ending both AC bonuses and speed reduction.

Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

If the wearer has a Strength score lower than 15, their speed is reduced by 10 feet.

    <text>This wooden rod is set with four glass spheres that each contain a microcosm of elemental energy.
	If an air elemental, a fire elemental, an earth elemental, or a water elemental is slain within 60 feet of you while you are holding the rod, the elemental is absorbed into the rod. A creature absorbed in this way occupies one of the four crystals in the rod. If the four crystals are already full when an elemental dies within range, the elemental dies as normal.
	As an action, you can present the rod and free one of the elementals contained within a crystal. The freed elemental appears within 5 feet of you and is friendly to you and your allies. Roll initiative for the summoned elemental, which has its own turns. The elemental obeys any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.

A freed elemental remains for 10 minutes, until you dismiss it, or until it is slain, after which it disappears to its home plane.

The creature blowing the trumpet can choose up to 12 allies within the area to receive the benefits of heaven's herald. An allied creature becomes immune to being frightened and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. In addition, its hit point maximum increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours. Once used in this way, the herald cannot be used again until dawn.
	If a neutral-aligned creature attempts to use the trumpet, no sound emerges, and nothing happens. If an evil-aligned creature attempts to use the trumpet, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw as a column of divine fire roars from the heavens to smite the user. A creature takes 8d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	The celestials don't realize that an equally powerful weapon rests in the hands of the very same armies of darkness that drove them back. The fates who inspired the smith to craft Zeal also sent a vision to a forge keeper of hell in the interest of maintaining the balance of power.

Hammer of Heaven. This magic warhammer grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra 3d10 radiant damage.

Champion of Good. While holding the hammer, you are immune to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned conditions.

Zealous Pursuit. As a bonus action, you can release Zeal to hover magically in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you can see the hammer, you can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one attack against a target or return to your hands. If any effect targets the hovering hammer, you are considered to be holding it. The hovering hammer falls if the attuned user dies.

Spells. While the hammer is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18): banishment, branding smite, beacon of hope, earthquake, or heroism. Once you use the hammer to cast a spell, that spell can't be cast again from it until the next dawn.

Destroying the Hammer. The only thing capable of damaging the hammer is its fiendish twin Ardor. A creature wielding Ardor can choose to attack Zeal, which has an AC of 21 and 300 HP. No other creature or object can damage Zeal.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

The creature gains the ability to communicate with telepathy out to a range of 60 feet. A creature you speak to in this manner does not need to share a language with you to communicate, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to messages but can't initiate a conversation with you.
	Stitching the mouth of a willing, unconscious, or incapacitated creature takes 10 minutes. Removing the stitches takes 1 minute.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>One fun and evocative way to understand and highlight the unique nature of Etharis rests in the devilish and bizarre details. In a world where magic is known to corrupt even the most innocent of objects, providing the characters seemingly mundane items that contain a hint of the macabre or grotesque can heighten tension and unease.
	The list of trinkets that follows can be used to give the characters something unusual during character creation. These trinkets can also be found on NPCs, who might cling to them with an illogical ferocity.
	They can be used to spice up treasure caches, act as decorations in areas that characters explore, or even become the centerpiece of some rumor or tale.
	However you choose to use them, never let any detail, no matter how mundane, go to waste as you build your particular version of Etharis or some other dark fantasy world.
