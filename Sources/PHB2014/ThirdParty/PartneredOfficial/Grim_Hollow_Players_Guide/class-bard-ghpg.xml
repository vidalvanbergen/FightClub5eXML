        <text>Bards from the College of Adventurers learn from heroes of old and stories of legend. Bards are jacks of all trades, and for the College of Adventurers this statement rings ever true. They combine all the useful skills of their companions into one, allowing them to be versatile and supportive. While not having a direct goal, many adventurer-studying bards live to tell tales of other heroes or seek to create their own. Stories of heroic deeds, tales of cunning, magical anomalies, or godly might fuel the life-blood of these bards.

A creature with one of your Bardic Inspiration dice can expend it when dealing damage with a weapon attack, dealing additional necrotic damage equal to the die result.
	Additionally, when a living creature that has your Bardic Inspiration die is reduced to 0 hit points, it can expend that die as a reaction to be reduced to 1 hit point instead.

        <text>At 6th level, you learn the animate dead spell. It counts as a bard spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of Bard spells you know.
	When you give a creature one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, choose a number of undead creatures equal to your proficiency bonus under your control and within 60 feet of you. Chosen creatures each gain a Dirge die, which they lose if they do not spend within the next 10 minutes. Dirge dice can be spent the same way and under the same circumstances your Bardic Inspiration dice are. You can also issue mental commands to undead creatures under your control as part of the same bonus action.
	When an undead creature you control expends a Dirge die on an attack roll that hits, it can also apply the result to the damage roll.
