      <name>Common Folk</name>
      <text>Common Folk are, unsurprisingly, the most common station in life. These are the masses of people who are not distinguished by noble blood, inherited wealth, or a special calling that sets them apart.
	Varying as much as the professions with which they occupy themselves, common folk are typically identified by the work they do.
	Often finding themselves pawns in the machinations of those who consider themselves their betters, commoners generally look after one another in tight circles of trust. Commoners are a great background for most professions and character concepts that do not fall within another background.

	• Languages: Choose one standard language.
	• Tool Proficiencies: One tool or instrument proficiency.

      <text>Merchants are the lifeblood of trade, and can be found anywhere from hawking goods in local marketplaces, to having established their own stores selling artisan wares. Merchants typically belong to a Merchant's Guild, and pay a yearly sum to register for protection by local law enforcement, though this varies by province.

Some choose instead to exploit the upper class, claiming that the ignorance of spoilt children is far more lucrative, if a little riskier. Ranging from the lowliest of hustlers selling miracle cure-alls to the most audacious con artists, all charlatans have a knack for fooling those unfortunate enough to cross their paths.

      <text>You are used to lying through your teeth, telling people whatever they want to hear in order to separate them from their money. It keeps you fed and one step ahead of the law, but you'll need a way to run bigger scams if you want to make real money.

Holdings:
	• A stash of counterfeit items that you sell and scam people with.
	• A secluded stoop that you use as a shelter against the elements near your place of "business"

    <trait>
      <name>Rank 3 - Con Artist</name>
      <text>You have become more daring in your approach, orchestrating swindles that require planning, resources, and teamwork in pursuit of a big payday. You may set your gang about duplicating famous paintings to be sold in foreign cities, for example, or forging property title deeds in order to sell a building you do not own.

Holdings:
	• A team of charismatic swindlers and skilled forgers who can recreate items at your request with great accuracy and detail.
	• An unmarked warehouse in a disreputable part of town, where you can store and create forged items and oversee your operations.

Then there are those who walk up to a target and explain the deal: give me what I want or bad things will happen to you. Call it "protection" or call it extortion, it is perhaps the most straightforward form of crime, favored by the violent and the ruthless.
	Most Cutthroats start out working in a pre-established gang, collecting fees and extracting payments on behalf of a boss. A small gang might be responsible for shaking down a handful of businesses, while the most powerful of crime lords may influence prominent cities or regions.

Some will even go out of their way to source rare and valuable items that you require, if they believe doing so will earn your favor.

Holdings:
	• A group of thugs that you command, overseeing their various ploys.
	• Knowledge of back alleys and slipways that allow you and your group to escape unpursued by local law enforcement.
	• A rundown establishment that you and your fellow henchmen operate out of.

Progression:
Your group of thugs has progressed in size to exert control over an entire village or district within a city. A sizable collection of shop owners that you can regularly exploit for "protection".</text>

      <name>Rank 3 - Gang Boss</name>
      <text>You are now a big fish in a small pond, often butting heads with rival gangs. Your presence is not quite strong enough to force your competition out of your territory. Whether you make a bid for control or they do, one thing is for certain: there will be blood in the streets.

	• Multiple warehouses and business fronts to launder and store your spoils until a suitable buyer can be located.

Holdings:
	• A number of personal secrets and incriminating evidence about high-ranking nobles, clergy, or business magnates.
	• A corrupt, influential state official who does your bidding and provides you with confidential information.</text>

      <name>Burglar</name>
      <text>Burglars break into and steal from houses, storefronts, and warehouses, primarily operating out of major cities and ports. While thieving is a risky pursuit, the hardest part can be finding a buyer for rare and valuable items. The more unique the good, the more likely its original owner will want it returned, cutting your profit margin considerably.
	Goods and valuables generally need to be sold through a fence: someone who will purchase your stolen goods, sell them to unknowing customers, and take a cut of your profits.

	• Skill Proficiency: Perception.
	• Additional Equipment: a grappling hook and rope, kidskin gloves, glass cutter, a vial of flour.</text>

      <name>Rank 1 - Snatcher</name>
      <text>Breaking into homes in the lower end of town is generally your trade. Authorities only worry about civilians with the power to cause a stir; everyone else is on their own. Locks in this end of town are easy to pick, if there is a lock at all. For the same reason, though, there is less to steal.

Holdings:
	• A safehouse in the poor district, used to store stolen goods and serving as emergency lodgings.
	• You have blueprints of a grand estate including secret entrances and passageways.

Progression:
You rob a well-to-do store in a reputable district, gaining notoriety and a big payday.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Rank 2 - Burglar Specialist</name>
      <text>Working in a team, while risky, allows for heists that would be beyond the reach of any one burglar, no matter how skilled. Increasingly, when someone has an ambitious crime planned and needs to assemble a team of "the best," they reach out to you.

Holdings:
	• A team of specialist thieves who operate under your instruction to execute more ambitious heists.
	• A contact working inside an establishment which you plan on robbing, who provides you information on the routine of the occupants, the location of valuable items, and escape routes.

Progression:
Membership in an established Thieves' Guild in a major city or town.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 3 - Heist Master</name>
      <text>Your skill as both a burglar and a leader has grown considerably over time. Whether by virtue of your own confidence or a message from the divine, you believe that you are capable of executing a major heist, with the right preparation and henchmen of course. Will it be a priceless painting you have been tasked with acquiring for a prospective buyer? A slovenly prince whose private affairs you seek to meddle in, having acquired his signet ring?

Holdings:
	• You hold a senior position in the Thieves' Guild, instructing junior members in lockpicking, housebreaking, and evading law enforcers.
	• You uncover evidence of an attempted assassination on the life of a noble whose estate you robbed.

Progression:
You orchestrate a large-scale heist to rob the estate of a local noble.</text>

After all, knowledge is power, and you've risen to a level where power is mandatory.
