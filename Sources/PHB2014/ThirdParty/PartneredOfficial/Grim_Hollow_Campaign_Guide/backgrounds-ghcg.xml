      <name>Courtier</name>
      <text>From notable socialites to distant noble family members and trusted servants, Courtiers represent the members of the aristocracy who are employed or invited by a ruler to make up their court. Courtiers live in close proximity to the ruling class to assist them and be part of their world. However, Courtiers are more often seen as schemers and manipulators than helpful assistants. The life of a Courtier is one of dangerous plots, uneasy political alliances, and the occasional act of betrayal - when it benefits them.

	• Skill Proficiency: Deception.
	• Additional Equipment: A medallion or pin displaying the house of your patron, court clothing.</text>

	• A team of servants and lesser Courtiers sworn to you either through authority or intrigue.
	• A private suite within your patron's estate that provides easy access to court and extravagant luxury.

      <text>You are a servant of an organized branch of religious enforcers who hunt down heretics and blasphemers within your own faith, and cultists of sinister powers. Divine justice does not discriminate, and you have mercilessly punished crimes both mundane and supernatural — a task that comes with little glory.

However, corruption is rife within the Inquisition itself due to the Order's power and authority, and those found guilty are likewise treated without mercy.

      <name>Villager</name>
      <text>You hail from a small settlement like many others, populated mainly by subsistence farmers and local craftsmen.

They may request a few hours of light labor in exchange for short stays, if the host is a landholder. Commoners are also willing to share information with their peers that they would withhold from people of higher stations.

	• Skill Proficiency: Insight.
	• Additional Equipment: An iron pot, a shovel, a tinderbox.</text>

      <name>Common Folk</name>
      <text>Common Folk are, unsurprisingly, the most common station in life. These are the masses of people who are not distinguished by noble blood, inherited wealth, or a special calling that sets them apart.
	Varying as much as the professions with which they occupy themselves, common folk are typically identified by the work they do.
	Often finding themselves pawns in the machinations of those who consider themselves their betters, commoners generally look after one another in tight circles of trust. Commoners are a great background for most professions and character concepts that do not fall within another background.

      <name>Criminal</name>
      <text>Criminals serve and thrive off the seedy underbelly of society. While many people run afoul of the law, this background is for people who make their livelihoods entirely outside the law. Rarely respected or honored within society, Criminals often hide their true profession from others.

	• Languages: Thieves' Cant.

      <name>Burglar</name>
      <text>Burglars break into and steal from houses, storefronts, and warehouses, primarily operating out of major cities and ports. While thieving is a risky pursuit, the hardest part can be finding a buyer for rare and valuable items. The more unique the good, the more likely its original owner will want it returned, cutting your profit margin considerably.
	Goods and valuables generally need to be sold through a fence: someone who will purchase your stolen goods, sell them to unknowing customers, and take a cut of your profits.

	• Skill Proficiency: Perception.
	• Additional Equipment: a grappling hook and rope, kidskin gloves, glass cutter, a vial of flour.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Rank 1 - Snatcher</name>
      <text>Breaking into homes in the lower end of town is generally your trade. Authorities only worry about civilians with the power to cause a stir; everyone else is on their own. Locks in this end of town are easy to pick, if there is a lock at all. For the same reason, though, there is less to steal.

Holdings:
	• A safehouse in the poor district, used to store stolen goods and serving as emergency lodgings.
	• You have blueprints of a grand estate including secret entrances and passageways.

Progression:
You rob a well-to-do store in a reputable district, gaining notoriety and a big payday.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Rank 2 - Burglar Specialist</name>
      <text>Working in a team, while risky, allows for heists that would be beyond the reach of any one burglar, no matter how skilled. Increasingly, when someone has an ambitious crime planned and needs to assemble a team of "the best," they reach out to you.

Holdings:
	• A team of specialist thieves who operate under your instruction to execute more ambitious heists.
	• A contact working inside an establishment which you plan on robbing, who provides you information on the routine of the occupants, the location of valuable items, and escape routes.

Progression:
Membership in an established Thieves' Guild in a major city or town.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Rank 3 - Heist Master</name>
      <text>Your skill as both a burglar and a leader has grown considerably over time. Whether by virtue of your own confidence or a message from the divine, you believe that you are capable of executing a major heist, with the right preparation and henchmen of course. Will it be a priceless painting you have been tasked with acquiring for a prospective buyer? A slovenly prince whose private affairs you seek to meddle in, having acquired his signet ring?

Holdings:
	• You hold a senior position in the Thieves' Guild, instructing junior members in lockpicking, housebreaking, and evading law enforcers.
	• You uncover evidence of an attempted assassination on the life of a noble whose estate you robbed.

Progression:
You orchestrate a large-scale heist to rob the estate of a local noble.</text>

However, you now steal to satiate a greater motivation through the exchange of private information, blackmail, and the acquisition of rare and powerful artifacts. After all, knowledge is power, and you've risen to a level where power is mandatory.

Holdings:
	• Your own estate with a household of staff, acquiring and selling rare and valuable items through your own circle of thieves, fences, and buyers.</text>

      <name>Beast Hunter</name>
      <text>Hunters make their living by trapping, hunting, and killing vicious beasts. Some provide meat and furs for settlements, or for trade. The strongest may become a community's best defense against wandering monsters.. They are often as brutish as the creatures they hunt, heavily scarred from close encounters with their prey. They are proficient in setting many different traps, from simple snares to spring-loaded traps and cages. The beast hunter typically favors ranged weapons when taking down larger prey, avoiding close range where possible. Some favor stealth, lying patiently in ambush, while others revel in the thrill of the chase. Beast hunters have a natural aptitude for tracking all manner of beasts, quickly noticing signs that an animal has passed by, down to an exact time and direction of travel.

Holdings:

	• Repute across the land as a figure of legend.
	• A mighty weapon or artifact provided by a client or retrieved from sunken treasure.
	• An audience with any Monarch or head of state, at their convenience, to discuss matters of salvage and treasure hunting within the realm.</text>
