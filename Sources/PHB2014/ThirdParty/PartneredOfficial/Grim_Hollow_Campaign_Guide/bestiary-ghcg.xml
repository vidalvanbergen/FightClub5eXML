    <description>The innkeeper of the Black Bard is a man of few words. He is the tavern's first victim and has taken it upon himself to maintain the peace. Outwardly gruff, Bryn discourages adventurers from exploring the tavern beyond the common room, and is quick to quash rumors of escape attempts among his regulars. He is well aware of the dangers on the second floor and above, as adventurers get closer to discovering the wizard beyond the attic skylight. Bryn keeps an enchanted greatsword hidden behind the bar in case a fight breaks out among the patrons, and he is swift to deliver the tavern's justice. However, the greatsword fears combat, and Bryn must be quick to grab it before it makes a break toward his quarters.
	A former adventurer himself, Bryn cuts an imposing figure under his barkeep's apron, towering over most of his patrons. He bears numerous scars from his earlier years spent marauding the outer reaches of Etharis, and maintains a short-trimmed beard and wavy, chestnut colored hair.
	Bryn Harjolf has the stats of a knight. However most of the time he is in common clothes instead of plate (AC 10). He also fights with his enchanted greatsword. (See Greatsword of the Craven)

Knight:
Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.

      <text>When fighting inside the tavern, the tavern itself attempts to fight hostile patrons. While Vieri is still alive, on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the the tavern can take one of the following lair actions:

Animate Object. The tavern, channeling through Vieri, casts animate object on furniture. The tavern can only concentrate on one instance of this spell at a time.

Entangling Floorboards. Each creature of the taverns's choice that starts its turn standing on floor boards must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</text>

    <description>This aloof bard performs at the tavern and is frequently seen tuning a lute he rarely plays. His angular face and distinctly feline mannerisms distinguish him from the other patrons.
	Vieri's secret is that he is a spy and the physical manifestation of the tavern's power, which extends to influence over time and space. While not a living creature, he is very fond of Dreams Leave—a highly addictive substance that produces distortions of perception.
	Vieri is pallid with raven-black hair that he often wears tied back from his face. Like other half-elves, he has slightly pointed ears and darkvision. He has steely grey eyes set off by green veins that radiate across his face. Vieri carries a pouch of Dreams Leave that replenishes itself at the end of each day. He has a lean build and nimble fingers, ideal for plucking the strings of his lute when the fancy takes him.

    <description>Jarah is a former Free Swords thug for hire with a quick temper. She finds her captivity boring and likes to pass the time by gambling or participating in drinking games. Jarah is known for her sleight of hand, taught to her by Vieri Barboro. She dislikes Bryn and openly mistrusts him. In combat, she favors a two-handed great axe that she carries slung across her back.
	Jarah has a stocky build, and is the only patron to stand taller than Bryn. As a half-orc, she has greyish skin and a strong, protruding jaw, though the rest of her face is decidedly feminine. She has a well-muscled body from years of training with her greataxe, and a thick black plait that she wears down her back.
	Jarah has the stats of a veteran except she uses a great axe instead of any other weapon, and is in common clothes the majority of time (AC 11).

Veteran:
Veterans are professional fighters that take up arms for pay or to protect something they believe in or value. Their ranks include soldiers retired from long service and warriors who never served anyone but themselves.

    <description>Aren and his three underlings are members of the Ebon Syndicate (all four have the stats of a spy). They value coin above all else, and would gladly turn on one another for the right price. They pass their captivity by gambling and participating in other games of chance, and always wager to win, sometimes against their better judgement. Aren has a shabby appearance and coarse articulation, likely the result of being brought up in among thieves from a young age.
	Aren is lean and small statured from years of malnutrition, but is surprisingly nimble on his feet and an adept lockpick. He has lank brown hair and green eyes, and a tattoo of the Hawk Moth symbol on his chest. He is tanned from years of taking on odd jobs to pay his way through the cities of Etharis, and addresses others with a rough Common accent.

Spy:
Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.

    <description>Mouse is a slim 9-year-old halfling boy with a great fascination for tales of Etharian heroes. He carries a copy of a book called Tales of Etharis with him, and wears a wooden toy sword slung at his hip. He is the most recent captive of the tavern, captured some 40 years ago. He idolizes people who resemble the heroes in his favorite book.
	Mouse is slight for his age —which is slight indeed, as a young halfling— with blond, curly hair and a cherubic face. He has dark brown eyes and slightly pointed ears. He wears a pair of patched trousers with suspenders and a loose shirt, clearly made for a human child much larger than himself.

Commoner:
Commoners include peasants, serfs, slaves, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.

    <description>Inorim is a powerful Wizard who has been held captive for over 300 years in the Tavern of the Lost. In that time he has made the attic his own realm within the tavern. His pocket universe, a windswept mountaintop of his own creation, allows him to remain unaffected by the tavern and retain his powers. The tavern greatly desires to possess Inorim, and sends hordes of animated furniture into the pocket universe to retrieve him, where they are promptly smashed to splinters by a stone golem under Inorim's control. Prior to his captivity, Inorim was a keen scholar of enchantment magic, and studied at the Ravencourt Sanctuary.
	Inorim is originally from the desert plains of Castinella, which he fled due to a zealous inquisitors pursuit. He has mahogany skin and dark, curly hair shot with silver. Maintaining the pocket universe has taken a toll on Inorim; he is evidently thin beneath his wizard's robes, and walks with a labored, twisted gait. He carries a black staff topped with an amber stone, which serves as a walking stick as much as a conduit for his powers.

Archmage:
Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.
	An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

    <description>Torven Chimer (commoner) is the innkeeper of the Sticky Stew, the inn where the adventure begins, not far from the entrance of the Pit. A true chatterbox, he claims to be the best cook in the area (where there are not many cooks anyway) among other talents. But under this affable exterior hides an attentive eavesdropper who could be an invaluable source of information for those who grease his palm...

    <description>Skellna Archbane is the only remaining daughter of the Archbane family. She never (openly) goes in the Pit, and thus is not known there, and even in the rest of Runeheim she hasn't drawn much attention. She is actually a talented illusionist who seeks help to lift a curse on her older brother Eldhyl, a member of a dark cult in the Pit called the Blood Daggers. She's the one responsible for the substitution of the characters' bag, with the intention of getting their help by involving them in the schemes taking place in the Pit. Skellna, Nell and Kalseln are the same person and have the stats of a Mage.

Nell, a strange young woman who wanders in the Pit, apparently knows many of its shortcuts and secrets. She is one of Skellna's alter egos.

Kalseln, also called "Kals" is an elusive sorceress leading a band of thieves that recently appeared in the Pit called the Grey Rogues. She is actually another of Skellna's alternate identities.

Mage:
Mages spend their lives in the study and practice of magic. Good-aligned mages offer counsel to nobles and others in power, while evil mages dwell in isolated sites to perform unspeakable experiments without interference.

    <description>Eldhyl Archbane, heir to the noble Archbane family, has fled his family's rich estate in an attempt to escape the truth of the Archbane family's dark deeds. He got addicted to Dreams Leaves, and was shortly afterwards captured by Falkia, with whom he apparently entertains an intimate relationship.

Noble:
Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of guards, as well as servants who are commoners.
	The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who aren't of noble birth.

      <name>Transformation</name>
      <text>Falkia is a rank 2 vampire and has the following transformational boons and flaws:

Transformational Boons. Blood Fury, Undead Form, Dread Knight Combat Training.

Transformational Flaws. Blood Thirst, Hideous Appearance.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Shapechanger</name>
      <text>If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.
	While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
	While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</text>

      <text>When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.
	While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.</text>

      <name>Regeneration</name>
      <text>The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.</text>

Forbiddance: The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

Harmed by Running Water: The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.

Stake to the Heart: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

Sunlight Hypersensitivity: The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>

The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.
	Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>

	• Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.

	• A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire's lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.

    <description>Falkia Coldheart is a vampire venerated by the Blood Daggers, cultists who terrorize the Pit in her name. She has grown addicted to the Dreams Leaves addicts' blood, and has recently chosen Nell's brother as her partner.

Vampire:
Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.

Dark Desires. Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.

Born from Death. Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.

Chained to the Grave. Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.

Undead Nature: Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.

    <description>Lieutenant Doze is a knight of the Archbane guard, in charge of maintaining peace in the Pit, or more accurately in charge of preventing whatever happens in the Pit from spreading outside of it. He has many scars, including a huge one on the side of his mouth that seems to be the cause of his strong accent. He holds his share of secrets, the greatest one being that he controls the smuggling of Dreams Leaves into the Pit.

Knight:
Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.

    <description>Ser Hugues le Généreux was a famous local knight who gave his life a century ago to defend the Lake's inhabitants against bandits and creatures of the dark. He had taken an oath to the ancient Water Spirit that dwelt in the Lake of Twin Waters. Though he perished shortly thereafter, his corpse was divided into five pieces which retained their connection to the Spirit's mystical powers to carry on Ser Genereux's unfulfilled oath. The remains are now venerated as sacred relics purported to protect the Lake.

    <description>Ymdrin Khaesir, an ambitious dark elf sorcerer who has recently (and secretly) settled in the area. He intends to take control of the local Spirit of Nature by invoking a curse on Ser Hugues' soul, awakening the Blood Knight.
	Indeed, the Spirit is weakened by the unfulfilled oath between it and Ser Hugues so many years ago, and it is only a matter of time before its power is depleted enough for Ymdrin to assume control through the Ritual of Dark Mist.

Mage:
Mages spend their lives in the study and practice of magic. Good-aligned mages offer counsel to nobles and others in power, while evil mages dwell in isolated sites to perform unspeakable experiments without interference.

Priest:
Priests bring the teachings of their gods to the common folk. They are the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold positions of influence in their communities. Evil priests might work openly under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects hidden in the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites. A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious ceremonies and other sacred duties.

    <description>Fate always finds a way to manifest, and those who try to cheat it are often punished harshly. One of the most horrific anathemas, the Bloated Gastromorph, appears as a symbol of gluttony and selfishness. This horrific creature is whispered in folk tales and legends, often as a warning to children of the gruesome consequences awaiting those who recklessly indulge. There is truth in the tales, and they should be heeded with great care.
	A Bloated Gastromorph is a humanoid who has been twisted and transformed by the final stages of a Curse of Ravenous Hunger. Enormous and bulging, the humanoid becomes a large, slug-like monster sprouting multiple hulking fist like claws, a wicked tentacle-like tongue, and a giant, voracious maw of gnashing teeth.
	Often dwelling in dank ruins of once-great castles, a Bloated Gastromorph cares about nothing but consuming everything, alive or not. They do not remember their goals or comrades, for ultimately they are not the person they once were, now just a twisted incarnation of pure gluttony.

Curse Monsters:
Etharis's cruelest spellcasters have made an art form of their spite. Etharian curses are hideous afflictions that strip a victim's soul down to a single, consuming vice. The victims become some of the most fearsome creatures in Etharis —monsters driven to spread pain and horror throughout the land until they are destroyed or, more rarely, cured.

Lost Memories Table:

1 | The target becomes deeply suspicious of a player or non-player character of the GM's choice. They gain the following flaw: "I know they are seeking to betray me. I have to act first-it's me or them!"
2 | The target forgets all memories of a loved one of the GM's choice. The next time they see them, it is as if they are meeting them for the first time.
3 | The target becomes stricken with doubt and gains the following flaw: "The world is out to get me and I can't win. I may as well give up now."
4 | The target forgets how to speak in one language known, randomly decided.
5 | The target forgets the location of something important to them, of the GM's choice. It may be the location of a goal, their home settlement, or a hidden treasure.
6 | The target loses an inconsequential memory such as what they ate a few nights ago or the name of an unimportant NPC.</text>

    <description>Deep within the twisted visage of a Dream Whisperer is the lost form of a fallen academic, mage, or intelligent creature, who has fallen to Fate's twisted ironies and been afflicted by a Curse of Lost Sentiment. Now they are but a deformed, hunched creature covered in contorted arms, its many hands grasping for memories.
	Dream Whisperers are animalistic creatures, compelled to harvest memories from unfortunate victims. For this reason they often reside among larger settlements. Preferring to attack at night, Dream Whisperers often sneak into unsuspecting targets' houses through windows and other openings, their many arms allowing them to scale otherwise impossible surfaces. Once inside, their arms serve a second function — to physically tear treasured memories from their victims and replace them with feelings of paranoia and doubt. Fighting a Dream Whisperer is a dangerous task. Brave heroes have been driven mad by the Dream Whisperer's aberrant abilities. Brothers in arms are compelled to turn on each other and the weakest minds snap, leaving drooling messes in their wake. With each stolen memory, the Dream Whisperer steals a small piece of identity, slaking its thirst for its now lost intelligence.

    <description>Avarice is a common vice in Etharis and none display this more than the victims of a Curse of Insatiable Greed. Where once a humanoid stood, now a bloated, ratlike monster known as a Verminous Abomination stands. Mutated beyond recognition, a Verminous Abomination is consumed with a desire for possessions-from beautiful riches to the discarded trash of city dwellers, it does not matter. To a Verminous Abomination, all possessions are prized, and for another to own them is an offense.
	Preferring to live under cities, Verminous Abominations make giant, labyrinthine lairs out of the hoards they amass. When the sewer system of a city becomes completely blocked due to the immense collection of the Abomination, the city will often call adventurers to "clean the sewers". To no one's surprise, they rarely return to the surface, as fighting a Verminous Abomination in its lair is a difficult task. The giant rat-like monster spews swarms of deformed ratlings from its bulging stomach, while it burrows in its filth-ridden lair, emerging to strike.

    <description>War is not an adventure, but a disease. Vicious combatants revel in carnage, destroying homes and lives without a second thought. For those who lost everything in these conflicts, the Curse of Uncontrollable Wrath can be their most powerful weapon for revenge.
	Great warriors and bloodthirsty tyrants alike are reduced to their basest instincts of rage upon becoming an Avatar of Slaughter. The violent are often targeted through a twisted sense of irony, but pacifists and gentle souls sometimes fall prey to this curse if the maledictor is particularly spiteful.
	An Avatar of Slaughter is a formidable sight: a daemonic minotaur creature of bulging veins and smoke fuming from its nostrils. The Avatar of Slaughter exists to kill and is given no respite from this urge. Their cursed nature compels them to destroy all in their proximity, often starting with friends and family.
	To fight an Avatar of Slaughter in head-to-head combat is suicide. Just as they are born in the fires of combat, they cannot be killed by it. However, due to their affinity for violence, it is possible to imprison one in a weapon.

Curse Monsters:
Etharis's cruelest spellcasters have made an art form of their spite. Etharian curses are hideous afflictions that strip a victim's soul down to a single, consuming vice. The victims become some of the most fearsome creatures in Etharis —monsters driven to spread pain and horror throughout the land until they are destroyed or, more rarely, cured.

    <description>Of all monsters throughout Etharis, none are more foreboding of vice than the Weeping Willow. It is said by wise men and seers that if you hear crying in the woods, you must move as quickly as you can away from it-though it already may be too late. Once the cries of a Weeping Willow are heard, one's heart takes blind control of their fate.
	A Weeping Willow is the unfortunate victim of a Curse of Conceited Obsession. Once a vain or narcissistic humanoid, it is now a winding half-tree half-humanoid creature warped by self love and malicious' intent. A Weeping Willow is obsessed with its own appearance, calling for brave heroes to aid it in its distress. Upon reaching the Weeping Willow, however, heroes find only a vicious predator, a grove of unusual shimmering trees, and a fate worse than death.
	Combating a Weeping Willow unprepared will likely end in disaster. The creatures' enthralling cries and illusory beauty are difficult to resist, drawing its prey closer. To make contact with a Weeping Willow is to invite doom upon oneself, for the touch of a Weeping Willow can transform any humanoid into a twisted tree, bearing mirrored leaves, for the vain creature to gaze into. Survivors of these encounters say it is best to leave these creatures alone with their gardens of reflecting trees and self-admiration.

    <description>Like other creatures spawned from vile curses, Body Snatchers are the result of a humanoid who has succumbed to a Curse of Damned Aging. However, much to the dismay of investigators, Body Snatchers are notoriously difficult to locate, as they hide in plain sight. When on the trail of a Body Snatcher, investigators often close in on the suspect only arrive a step too late, and find a withered and discarded skin sack.
	Body Snatchers are ooze-like creatures that inhabit the bodies of victims, living inside them like a parasite feeding on their life force. The Body Snatcher takes complete control of its host body, which it enhances with supernatural capabilities. The only sign that an individual has been invaded by a body snatcher is their erratic behaviour and rapid aging—a host can age a lifetime in a matter of a few weeks.
	Fighting a Body Snatcher is easier said than done. While far from helpless, Body Snatchers prefer to avoid detection and will engage enemies only in dire situations or when changing hosts. They do their gruesome business in seclusion as much as possible.

    <description>Plague is an ever-present threat in Etharis. A vile and decaying Plague Carrion spews pestilence across the landscape, wilting vegetation and poisoning living creatures.
	Of all curse monsters, individual Plague Carrions represent the greatest threat to the people of Etharis. Some even say the Weeping Pox is a product of a Plague Carrion.
	To fall victim to a Curse of Foul Blight is a miserable fate. Often used by hags and dark sorcerers to spite beautiful rivals out of jealousy, if it is not cured the victim inevitably becomes a Plague Carrion: a deformed creature covered in callus-like chimneys that expel clouds of plague and insects like a sickening exhaust. A Plague Carrion is compelled by its curse to wander the countryside, tormented by its own decaying effects if it lingers in the same place for too long.
	This cruel punishment ensures its foul blight spreads throughout the land.
	A Plague Carrion is a sad creature that loathes its own existence and laments combat. That being said, a Plague Carrion will defend itself if agitated. When attacked, a Plague Carrion will emit thick poisonous and infectious fumes to combat adversaries. Failing that, it will use its bite with deadly results.

From towers collapsing to fatal accidents, a Herald of Calamity brings tragedy upon all who linger in its presence. Often possessing a village well, bridge, or other communal location of importance, it can inflict many casualties before people think to abandon it.
	A Herald of Calamity is a skeletal creature, invisible except under moonlight. Yet whenever one is present, its effects are felt. What may start as a simple mishap can quickly grow into a series of spiraling disasters that bring ruin upon an entire town.
	Unlike other curse monsters, a Herald of Calamity is not physically formidable, nor does it wield tremendous arcane powers. However, many monster hunters have been slain believing a Herald of Calamity would be an easy fight. Expert marksmen have misfired, fatally wounding companions. Seasoned rogues have slipped on trivial obstacles and received debilitating injuries. Regardless of the circumstance, all who have fought a Herald of Calamity agree that no skill can be relied on and anything can happen.
