    <text>You channel the powers of the Primordials to animate a number of plants within range. These plants must be in an open and unoccupied space. If no space is available, then the GM may choose to have plants rapidly grow as a result of the spell. In this case the GM also chooses how many plants grow. Choose one of the following options for what appears:

	• One plant of challenge rating 2 or lower
	• Two plants of challenge rating 1 or lower
	• Four plants of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
	• Eight plants of challenge rating 1/4 or lower

Each plant is considered an elemental in addition to its other types, and it becomes a normal plant again when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The animated creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the animated creatures as a group, which has its own turns. The creatures obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you).
	If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the creatures' statistics.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the animating options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.

    <text>This spell may only be cast at night. Choose a corpse, or a number of corpses, within range that are equivalent the size of the creatures you are animating (the GM will determine how many corpses are required). You can animate a number of large or smaller undead creatures equalling a total challenge rating 2 or lower.
	On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which time it stops obeying any command you've given it.
	To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over 1 creature you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one. Additionally, casting this spell in this manner does not require spell components with a GP cost.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can animate or reassert control of an additional CR worth of undead creatures created with this spell. When you cast this spell using a 9th level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over an additional two CR worth of undead creatures created with this spell. Additional creatures must be animated with sufficient corpses or bones.

This illusion moves as its physical counterpart would, but it is weightless and is tangible only to the caster of the spell. This instrument may be used as a spellcasting focus. This illusory instrument dissipates if the spellcaster moves 10 feet away from it or chooses to end the spell. As a bonus action, you can command your instrument to create one of the following effects:

	• Mimic basic sounds heard on a daily basis, such as a bird chirping, footsteps, or a slamming door.

	• Automatically play a basic beat at the tempo of your choice.

	• Record anything played on it, and play it back on a loop.

	• Record and play back any noise that it could pick up within 15 feet, such as conversation, a royal decree, or a snoring party member who swears that they don't.

    <text>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a sickly green ethereal tether forms between you and your target. Whenever you take damage, each tethered target takes half that amount as necrotic damage. Damage dealt this way is distributed after any damage resistances or immunities are applied. If a target with a tether drops to o Hit Points, they are no longer affected by the tether. As a bonus action, you can move the tether from one fallen foe to another target. The new target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or also be subject to the effects of this spell. A target may only have one tether attached to them from any instance of this spell at a given time.

At Higher Levels: When casting this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of tethers created is increased by one for every two slot levels above the 2nd.

    <text>You attempt to copy and cast a spell that you can see being cast. If the targeted spell is 2nd level or lower, then the spell is automatically copied. Copying a spell of 3rd level or higher requires a successful ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell is copied, and you cast that spell at the lowest level it can be cast. You can only copy spells of a lesser or equal level to the spell slot used to cast Mirror Spell. You can choose new targets for the copied spell. The following rules apply:

	• You cannot copy your own spell.

	• You can only copy spells cast by creatures.

	• For all intents and purposes, you are the original caster of the mirrored spell, and your spellcaster ability modifier is used if required. The same is true for saving throw DCs and attack modifiers.

At Higher Levels: You can cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher. If you do, you can copy a spell of equal or lower level.

    <text>This spell can only be cast at night. Choose a corpse, or a number or corpses, within range that are equivalent to the size of the creature you are animating (the GM will determine how many corpses are required). Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. You may choose for the target to become an undead creature of CR 3 or lower (the GM has the creature's game statistics).
	On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.

This use of the spell reasserts your control over 1 creature you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one. Any creature you have maintained with this spell for 30 days remains permanently under your control. You may only control a maximum of four creatures with this spell.

    <text>This spell curses a creature on the same plane of existence as you with an obsessive selfinfatuation. The target must make a Charisma saving throw against the spell's DC, which is modified by the Curse Strength Table. On a successful save, the target becomes aware that somebody attempted to curse them. On a failed save, the target becomes cursed and is unaware of this. Upon the completion of this curse's triggering event, the target automatically advances to stage 1 of this curse.

Triggering event: The next time the cursed creature looks into a mirror or reflective surface, it spontaneously cracks.

Stage 1: The cursed creature is compelled to stop and admire themselves whenever they see their own reflection.

Stage 2: The cursed creature becomes obsessed with looking for and finding its own reflection wherever it goes. Additionally, the cursed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

Stage 3: The cursed creature is driven to find or, if necessary, build a location where it can see its own reflection from many angles. The cursed creature is compelled to remain in this location and admire itself. Additionally, attack rolls against the creature gain advantage.

Culmination: Upon failing the final escalation check, the cursed creature twists into a deformed figure and becomes a Weeping Willow. If the creature is a player character, they become an NPC under the GM's control.

Escalation: Escalation represents the curse gaining power as time goes on. At dawn once a day, a cursed creature must make an escalation check to see if their curse escalates. To pass, a creature needs to roll an unmodified d20, and obtain a score greater than the number of checks they have made on this stage. On a failed save, the cursed creature applies the effects of the next stage of the curse, in addition to any previous stages.
	For example, a creature who has just been cursed makes an escalation check the following dawn. They must roll greater than a 1. The next day the DC will increase to 2, and so on. If, on the 5th dawn, they roll a 5 or less, the curse escalates to the second stage. They apply any new effects and reset the DC to 1.

Curing: Once they have begun, curses are notoriously difficult to cure. Many adventurers have fallen to a curse before they were able to gather the components to cure it. As a result, it is not unheard of for traveling mystics to carry multiple curing ingredients with them, to sell for exorbitant prices.
	To cure a curse, a cursed creature must be targeted with the remove curse spell. In addition, a number of cure components are required equal to the number of stages their curse has escalated to. For example, a curse that has escalated to stage 3 requires 3 cure components as well as a remove curse spell.
	The following items outline a number of cure components that can be found within the world of Etharis. A GM can include additional components based on their setting, campaign story or game mechanic they wish to include.

	• Hag's promise. A potion brewed by hags, purposely named confusingly.

	• A strand of hair from the lost but not found. From a pillow or other possession of a lost person.

	• A twice-murdered raven. A raven that has been killed, resurrected, then killed again.

	• The highest pinecone of a forest. Found with a lot of climbing.

	• A clock which runs backwards. Casting slow and haste on a timepiece will cause it to tick backwards.

	• A black pearl, harvested but a week ago.

	• Found with a lot of swimming.

	• A book that has never been read. From a publisher or printing press.

	• A rose that grows in darkness but not sunlight. A rare flower known as a Black Rose.

	• A life willingly given. Someone willing to sacrifice themself to cure the cursed.

	• Wish. A wish granted by a spell or entity.

Stage 2: The cursed creature becomes feeble as their muscle mass begins to deteriorate. The cursed creature has disadvantage on Strength saving throws.

Stage 3: The cursed creature starts to age rapidly, becoming decrepit. The cursed creature's Strength score becomes 6, unless it was already lower.

Culmination: Upon failing the final escalation check, the cursed creature twists into a deformed figure and becomes a Body Snatcher. If the creature is a player character, they become an NPC under the GM's control.

    <text>This spell curses a creature on the same plane of existence as you with lethal bad luck.

On a successful save, the target becomes aware that somebody attempted to curse them. On a failed save, the target becomes cursed and is unaware of this.

Triggering event: The next time the target walks through a doorway or up a flight of stairs, the target stubs their toe, bruising it badly.

Stage 1: The cursed creature falls victim to minor inconveniences and bad luck. Shops they wish to visit close just as they arrive, equipment breaks at inconvenient moments, and other unfortunate events befall them.

Stage 2: The cursed creature becomes a beacon of bad luck as otherwise harmless setbacks become increasingly dangerous. For example, objects constantly seem to be placed in their way. Additionally, the cursed creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Stage 3: The cursed creature becomes dangerously accident-prone, as even the simplest tasks have unforeseen life-threatening consequences. The cursed creature's Dexterity score becomes 6, unless it was lower already.

Culmination: Upon failing the final escalation check, the cursed creature twists into a deformed figure and becomes a Herald of Calamity. If the creature is a player character, they become an NPC under the GM's control.

Escalation: Escalation represents the curse gaining power as time goes on. At dawn once a day, a cursed creature must make an escalation check to see if their curse escalates. To pass, a creature needs to roll an unmodified d20, and obtain a score greater than the number of checks they have made on this stage.

If, on the 5th dawn, they roll a 5 or less, the curse escalates to the second stage. They apply any new effects and reset the DC to 1.

Curing: Once they have begun, curses are notoriously difficult to cure. Many adventurers have fallen to a curse before they were able to gather the components to cure it. As a result, it is not unheard of for traveling mystics to carry multiple curing ingredients with them, to sell for exorbitant prices.
	To cure a curse, a cursed creature must be targeted with the remove curse spell. In addition, a number of cure components are required equal to the number of stages their curse has escalated to. For example, a curse that has escalated to stage 3 requires 3 cure components as well as a remove curse spell.
	The following items outline a number of cure components that can be found within the world of Etharis. A GM can include additional components based on their setting, campaign story or game mechanic they wish to include.

	• Hag's promise. A potion brewed by hags, purposely named confusingly.

	• A strand of hair from the lost but not found. From a pillow or other possession of a lost person.

	• A twice-murdered raven. A raven that has been killed, resurrected, then killed again.

	• The highest pinecone of a forest. Found with a lot of climbing.

	• A clock which runs backwards. Casting slow and haste on a timepiece will cause it to tick backwards.

	• A black pearl, harvested but a week ago.

	• Found with a lot of swimming.

	• A book that has never been read. From a publisher or printing press.

	• A rose that grows in darkness but not sunlight. A rare flower known as a Black Rose.

	• A life willingly given. Someone willing to sacrifice themself to cure the cursed.

	• Wish. A wish granted by a spell or entity.

    <text>This spell curses a creature on the same plane of existence as you with a bitter and self-destructive greed. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against the spell's DC, which is modified by the Curse Strength Table. On a successful save, the target becomes aware that somebody attempted to curse them. On a failed save, the target becomes cursed and is unaware of this. Upon the completion of this curse's triggering event, the target automatically advances to stage 1 of this curse.

Triggering event: The next time the target completes a long rest, they notice they have lost a valued item.

Stage 1: The cursed creature becomes compelled to steal trinkets they do not own.

Stage 2: The cursed creature finds a secret place to start stashing their hoard, and becomes anxious about leaving the location of their hoard for extended periods of time. Additionally, the cursed creature has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.

Stage 3: The cursed creature is driven to transform their hoard into a labyrinth of possessions and treasure they have stolen. The cursed creature cannot leave this labyrinth. Additionally, the cursed creature's Wisdom score becomes 6, unless it was already lower.

Culmination: Upon failing the final escalation check, the cursed creature twists into a deformed figure and becomes a Verminous Abomination. If the creature is a player character, they become an NPC under the GM's control.

Escalation: Escalation represents the curse gaining power as time goes on. At dawn once a day, a cursed creature must make an escalation check to see if their curse escalates. To pass, a creature needs to roll an unmodified d20, and obtain a score greater than the number of checks they have made on this stage. On a failed save, the cursed creature applies the effects of the next stage of the curse, in addition to any previous stages.
	For example, a creature who has just been cursed makes an escalation check the following dawn. They must roll greater than a 1. The next day the DC will increase to 2, and so on. If, on the 5th dawn, they roll a 5 or less, the curse escalates to the second stage. They apply any new effects and reset the DC to 1.
