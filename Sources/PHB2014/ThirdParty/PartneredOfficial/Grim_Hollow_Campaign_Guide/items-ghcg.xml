    <name>Arc Rifle</name>
    <detail>very rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>In the unforgiving lands of Etharis, having reliable and efficient weapons is as essential as carrying water and food. In that regard, skilled inventors are highly sought after, and among them gnomes are the most renowned. However, innovation can sometimes go too far, and the Arc Rifle is the perfect example of how. Invented by a team of famous gnome engineers, it literally shoots lightning, hitting the target faster than any other ranged weapon and reducing flesh to ashes in mere seconds, regardless of armor. Due in part to this tremendous efficiency, this weapon was quickly declared illegal in most regions of Etharis. It is also believed to destroy the target's soul when it kills them.
	This part-science, part-arcane contraption is a rifle-like weapon housing glass tubes of sparking electricity and powered by a small perpetual-motion device.
	The Arc Rifle has 4 charges. It regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

Lightning Torrent. You can expend 1 charge as an action to launch a torrent of lightning in a 60-foot line, 5 feet wide. Each creature that the lightning passes through must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to your scatter save DC. On a failed save a creature takes 6d6 lightning damage, or half as much on a successful save.

Whenever you expend the last charge of the Arc Rifle, roll a d20. On a result of 1 the Arc Rifle has fried its mechanisms and becomes useless.

    <name>Collar of Undead</name>
    <detail>very rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Some people have no qualms about exploiting any opportunity for profit, including the sorrow caused by the loss of a loved one. Such people will undoubtedly make good use of the Collar of Undead, whether as professional smugglers looking for wealthy widows or widowers to plunder, or dark sorcerers in need of souls. This magical collar, when placed around the neck of a recently deceased person, will animate the body again, making it capable of many simple actions on command. The risen corpse will also be able to repeat words specified by the person who placed the collar on them. It is no surprise, then, that some desperate people will let themselves be abused by the hope of using this object to keep their loved one with them a little longer.
	When placed around the neck of a humanoid creature that has died within the last 10 days, and is Large or smaller, the creature comes back to life with 1 hit point. The creature becomes undead and is subject to all features that affect undead. The creature does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. At dawn each day, the creature's hit point maximum decreases by 1d4 as its body rots and decays. When the creature's hit points reach o, it falls apart into a heap of dust and is destroyed.
	While wearing the collar, the creature is under your command and follows your orders to the best of its ability. On your turn you can issue a command to the creature as a Bonus Action. If no order is given, the creature follows any previous commands given and defends itself to the best of its ability.
	If the collar is removed from the creature that it has brought back to life, the creature is immediately reduced to 0 hit points.

    <name>Thought Talker Orbs</name>
    <detail>uncommon (requires attunement)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This magical device is composed of two orbs: an "emitter" orb that captures the thoughts of anyone nearby and transmits them to another orb, called the "receiver".
	Convenient for spying, it is said to have been designed by gnome engineers hired by the Ebon Syndicate. The emitter orb measures barely half an inch and weighs less than a marble, which makes it very easy to slip in a pocket or attach to a piece of clothing.
	A creature holding both orbs can activate them by using an action and touching them together. Once they are active, any creature that moves within a 5-foot radius of the emitter orb, or starts its turn within 5 feet of the orb, must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, any attuned creature holding the receiver orb becomes immediately aware of that creature's current surface thoughts.

    <name>Breath of Beleth</name>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Named after the Arch Daemon of Fear, this poison creates an extremely powerful hallucinogenic effect which evokes a victim's worst fears. The poison is airborne and victims need only breathe it in to suffer its effects. The rare occasions when it was used have resulted in rooms full of people jumping out of windows or killing each other out of raw fear. Rumors say that the poison was quickly forbidden even by the Ebon Syndicate, deemed too dangerous, too extravagant, and too conspicuous. But chances are such a powerful substance wasn't simply abandoned, and others rumors say the Ebon Syndicate still uses a milder version during interrogation.

Breath of Beleth (Inhaled). A creature subject to the poison must succeed at a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the creature immediately becomes frightened of all hostile creatures it can see, and must take the Dash action and move away from them by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.

    <name>Full Moon Extract</name>
    <detail>uncommon</detail>
    <type>P</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Despite its poetic name, this extremely addictive powder is not produced from any component coming from the moon. According to the most common rumors, it is mostly made of dried werewolf organs. It is thus hardly surprising that its success relies on the surge of raw strength it provides to its users, making it a favored drug for many wrestlers, boxers, and soldiers.
	However, prolonged use is highly risky as it causes a strong addiction combined with an increasing inability to distinguish friend from foe. It is not known whether this side-effect exists by intent or not, but the fact remains that Full Moon users most often end up killed by their companions or local authorities when bloodlust overtakes them.
	Upon consuming Full Moon Extract, a creature's Strength score becomes 19 (if it was not already higher). Additionally, the creature gains advantage on all Strength ability checks and saving throws. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
	If a character consumes Full Moon Extract a number of times equal to their Constitution modifier plus 1 (minimum of 1), they become addicted to it. So a creature with a Constitution score of 16 will become addicted after consuming it for the fourth time. An addicted creature must consume Full Moon Extract every 24 hours or have disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks and saving throws. The addiction lasts until the creature is targeted with a greater restoration spell, or after 30 days of not consuming Full Moon Extract.
	A character who uses full moon extract while addicted to it must succeed on a DC 6 Charisma saving throw or be overcome by violent urges. A character who fails the save is compelled to attack the nearest living creature they can see until the effects of the extract wear off.

    <name>Aether Blood</name>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>P</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>The most extravagant rumors claim the blood of a unicorn is required to make this purple substance, available in liquid form only. Whether these mythical creatures exist or not, there's no question that Aether Blood is highly magical in nature. Glowing in the dark, it is said to significantly improve the magical attunement of the body, hence its popularity among spellcasters. It allows users to cast spells faster and detect magical manifestations more easily, among other things. However, even the most experienced spellcasters can't bear the exhausting effects of this attunement on the body, which suffers significant premature aging from prolonged usage. Many spellcasters carry a small reserve of Aether Blood for the most dire situations.
	After consuming Aether Blood, when a creature uses a spell slot, it counts as 1 spell level higher when determining the level the spell was cast at. If the spell has no additional effects when cast at a higher level, the Aether Blood has no effect. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
	If a character consumes Aether Blood a number of times equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), they become addicted to it. So a creature with a Constitution score of 16 will become addicted after consuming it for the third time. An addicted creature must consume Aether Blood once every 24 hours or have disadvantage on Constitution ability checks and saving throws. The addiction lasts until the creature is targeted with a greater restoration spell, or after 30 days of not consuming Full Moon Extract.

    <name>Dreams Leaves</name>
    <detail>uncommon</detail>
    <type>P</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Made from a mysterious, magically grown plant, this new drug has quickly gained immense popularity and its prices have skyrocketed. Users have vivid hallucinations in which all their wishes are fulfilled, hence the success of the Dreams Leaves. Moreover, rumors have begun to spread that users see visions of branching possibilities their life could take. Addicts will do anything for it, especially those in a poor situation who direly need an escape from harsh reality. However, use of the substance takes a horrific toll on the individual's mental capacity. Therefore, this substance is also often called the Collar of the Poor.
	Upon consuming Dreams Leaves, a creature falls into a deep trance-like state and is considered unconscious. This state lasts for 1 hour. Upon awakening the creature has fond memories of their dreams, as well as small premonitions of their possible future, and gains 1 dream point.
	If the creature is attacked or shaken by another creature while in this trance they awake early and do not receive a dream point. They may use the dream point, as a reaction, to gain advantage on one attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw.
	If a character consumes Dreams Leaves, they become addicted to it. An addicted creature must consume Dreams Leaves once every 24 hours or have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability checks and saving throws. The addiction lasts until the creature is targeted with a greater restoration spell, or after 30 days of not consuming Dreams Leaves.

    <name>Seven Shades of Sitri</name>
    <type/>
    <text>This venereal disease is not lethal but has indirectly caused many deaths. The Arch Daemon Sitri is said to be responsible for the appearance of this disease, hence its name. Stimulating lust to extremes, it is rumored to have prevented city garrisons from defending the walls on several occasions, allowing fortified cities to be taken easily where a years-long siege was expected. The exact propagation vector of the disease is not known with certainty as several variants — or shades — of the disease seem to coexist, strangely appearing in a region only to spontaneously disappear some time later. Rumours have it that dark bargains are signed in the shadows to unleash the Seven Shades and trigger unrest ahead of bolder political or military moves.
	After prolonged physical contact with an infected creature, a humanoid must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, becoming infected with the Seven Shades of Sitri on a failed save. If a creature's saving throw is successful, they become immune to the Shades for 24 hours.
	An infected humanoid is overcome with carnal urges and becomes charmed by all non-hostile humanoids that interact with them. The Seven Shades of Sitri can be removed by any method that cures diseases. The disease ends on its own after 2d4 days.

    <dmg1>2d6</dmg1>
    <dmgType>S</dmgType>
    <text>The wielder of this sword gains +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while attuned to this weapon, its users speed is increased by 5 feet and they have advantage on initiative rolls.

Curse. This greatsword is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to the attuned. As long as the curse remains the owner is unwilling to part with the greatsword, keeping it on their person at all times. Anyone attuned to this weapon has disadvantage on all attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.
	Whenever the cursed creature tries to pick up a weapon it will move slightly out of the way, requiring a successful DC 10 Dexterity check or spending an action to grab purchase of the hilt.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, greatsword
