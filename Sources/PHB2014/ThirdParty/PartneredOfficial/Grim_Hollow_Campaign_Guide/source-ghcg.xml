  <description>Do you dare set foot within the world of Etharis?

A god-less, unforgiving, war-torn world filled with Curses, Plagues &amp; Ghoulish Creatures. A civilization that has long forgotten hope and now clings on desperately for survival.

What to expect in this adventure:

	• Discover a world in desperate need of heroes. In a world that is brimming with history, depth, culture &amp; conflict, players will fight for every small victory and mourn every loss as the very world itself fights back.

	• Transform yourself in a hunt for power. Within Grim Hollow there are over five different Player Character transformations available: each with their own diverse range of pros and cons. Invoke supernatural powers and lay waste to those who oppose you. Featuring a diverse array of new spells &amp; feats, as well as the addition of curse: you will find that there is always a means to an end… for a price

	• Flesh out your characters with unique motivations and goals. Containing a completely rebuilt Background System with a host of new feats and abilities, your character can start as a simple peasant and rise to the role of powerful Crime Lord. Forge your own pathway.

	• If you've been searching for an in-dept resource overflowing with lore, notable NPC's, a range of new mechanics, items and spells: an imaginative, gripping and downright fear-inducing campaign guide then prepare yourself, for you have stumbled upon what you seek.

Welcome to Ethers… We'll see if you survive…</description>
