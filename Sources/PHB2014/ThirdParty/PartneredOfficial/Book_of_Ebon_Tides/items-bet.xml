	When combined with a ring of dancing, you gain advantage on all Charisma ability checks.

    <name>Cloak of Splendor</name>
    <detail>uncommon (requires attunement)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This cloak is made of fine ermine and often embellished with fasteners or trimmed with gold or embroidered orange candles, suns, or similar symbols. While wearing this cloak, you can grip its edges and generate a sunbeam spell once per day. If you release the cloak's edges from your grasp, the light fades, and you cannot generate further lines of radiance.
	In addition, while wearing the cloak, you can use your action to generate a set of 10 magical lights once per day, each as bright as a lantern and shedding full sunlight in a 20-foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any or all the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 30 feet of another light created by this cloak, and a light winks out if travels more than 100 feet from you.

    <name>Cloak of the Raven</name>
    <detail>uncommon</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. In an area of dim light or sunlight, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 30 feet. If you release the cloak's edges from your grasp while flying in this way or if you are no longer in dim light or sunlight, you lose this flying speed.
	While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or sunlight, you can use your action to cast daylight as a readied action. You may then fly or carry the daylight spell into any area of darkness. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

    <name>Earrings of Eclipse</name>
    <detail>uncommon</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These two cubes of smoky quartz are mounted on simple, silver posts. While you are wearing these earrings, you can take the Hide action while you are motionless in an area of dim light or darkness even when a creature can see you or when you have nothing to obscure you from the sight of a creature that can see you. If you are in darkness when you use the Hide action, you have advantage on the Dexterity (Stealth) check. If you move, attack, cast a spell, or do anything other than remain motionless, you are no longer hidden and can be detected normally.

    <name>Emerald Goblet</name>
    <detail>uncommon</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This goblet's rim and stem are made of silver. The cup of the goblet is a single enormous chunk of emerald that allows a view of the liquid within. When filled with any liquid, it becomes a shining green vessel filled with a green potion. Any creature that drinks from the goblet is protected against shadow corruption for a day.
	The protection grants several additional benefits: you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks used to gather food within the Shadow Realm, and you gain darkvision to 30 feet or extend your existing dark vision by 30 feet.

    <name>Gloves of the Walking Shade</name>
    <detail>very rare (requires attunement)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Each glove is comprised of three black-ivory rings (fitting the thumb, middle finger, and pinkie) which are connected to each other. The rings are then connected to an intricately engraved onyx wrist cuff by a web of fine platinum chains and tiny diamonds.
	While wearing these gloves, you gain the following:

	• You have resistance to necrotic damage.

	• You can spend one Hit Die during a short rest to remove one level of exhaustion instead of regaining hit points.

	• You can use an action to become a living shadow. While you are a living shadow, you can move through a space as narrow as I inch wide without squeezing, and you can take the Hide action as a bonus action while you are in dim light or darkness. Once used, this property of the gloves can't be used again until the next nightfall.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Glowstone helmets are usually of gnomish manufacture. While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast a particular cantrip associated with that helmet (often dancing lights, light, mending, or sometimes produce flame). When combined with a frostglow weapon or a find the path spell, this helmet allows you to sense the direction and distance to the nearest ley line, shadow road, radiant well, and similar arcane landmarks.

    <name>Styx Boots</name>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These boots are usually made of heavy, sturdy leather—perhaps it's demon hide or some other planar creature's hide. While wearing these boots, you can walk over any body of water as if it were normal terrain, and you can slide or skate over relatively calm waters, snow, ice, sand, magma, or other smooth surfaces at double your normal walking speed. If the snow or ice is on a hill, you move at triple your normal walking speed. You can still use the Dash action normally as well.
	When combined with the armor of the Black River, the Styx boots permit you to use any branch of the River Styx and other planar waterways as a form of shadow road. Once per week, you can walk on such a planar waterway for 8 hours and arrive at any other plane of your choosing.

    <text>These boots are usually shaped with a bright leather: red, orange, or purple. While wearing these boots, you can leave the tracks of any other creature in the snow, as you choose, including animal, monster, or even dragon tracks. You can also leave tracks resembling footgear you have seen or worn in the past. Attempts to follow these tracks are made normally.

    <name>Whispering Cloak</name>
    <detail>rare (requires attunement)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This cloak is made of black, brown, and white bat pelts sewn together. While wearing it, you have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you transform into a creature of pure shadow. While in shadow form, your AC increases by 2, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can move through a space as narrow as I inch wide without squeezing. You can cast spells normally while in shadow form, but you can't make ranged or melee attacks with nonmagical weapons. In addition, you can't pick up objects, and you can't give objects you are wearing or carrying to others.
	This effect lasts up to 1 hour. Deduct time spent in shadow form in increments of 1 minute from the total time. After it has been used for 1 hour, the cloak can't be used in this way again until the next dusk when its time limit resets. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
