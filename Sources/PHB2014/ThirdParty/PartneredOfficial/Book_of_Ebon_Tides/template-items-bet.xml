    <text>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you are immune to shadow corruption (see Chapter 5) and void taint (see Midgard Worldbook) while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to assume a ghostly form for 10 minutes (together with up to ten creatures you touch), or until you are no longer wearing the armor, gaining a flying speed of 200 feet. You cannot take actions other than movement while in this form. Once this special action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
	When combined with the Styx boots, the armor of the Black River permits you to use any branch of the River Styx or other planar waterways as a shadow road. Once per week, you can walk on such a planar waterway for 8 hours and arrive at any other plane of your choosing.</text>

    <text>You are immune to necrotic and cold damage and vulnerable to fire and radiant damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you are imbued with soul-devouring energy. When you hit with a melee attack, the target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain 3d6 hit points. If you gain hit points above your maximum, you immediately gain a level of exhaustion, and the soul-devouring power of the armor ends until the next dawn.</text>

    <text>This glossy black armor is made from enchanted carrion beetle chitin by the darakhul. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the ebony beetle version of the armor doesn't. While wearing the armor, you are immune to slashing damage. It is half the weight of comparable metal armor.</text>

    <text>While wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to move incorporeally for 1 round. You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 (1d10) force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your level.</text>
