    <type>HA</type>
    <text>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you are immune to shadow corruption (see Chapter 5) and void taint (see Midgard Worldbook) while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to assume a ghostly form for 10 minutes (together with up to ten creatures you touch), or until you are no longer wearing the armor, gaining a flying speed of 200 feet. You cannot take actions other than movement while in this form. Once this special action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
	When combined with the Styx boots, the armor of the Black River permits you to use any branch of the River Styx or other planar waterways as a shadow road. Once per week, you can walk on such a planar waterway for 8 hours and arrive at any other plane of your choosing.</text>

    <type>HA</type>
    <text>You are immune to necrotic and cold damage and vulnerable to fire and radiant damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you are imbued with soul-devouring energy. When you hit with a melee attack, the target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain 3d6 hit points. If you gain hit points above your maximum, you immediately gain a level of exhaustion, and the soul-devouring power of the armor ends until the next dawn.</text>

    <type>MA,HA</type>
    <text>This glossy black armor is made from enchanted carrion beetle chitin by the darakhul. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the ebony beetle version of the armor doesn't. While wearing the armor, you are immune to slashing damage. It is half the weight of comparable metal armor.</text>

    <text>While wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to move incorporeally for 1 round. You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 (1d10) force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your level.</text>

    <type>HA</type>
    <text>This armor is made of woven moonlight by the shadow goblins. It weighs half as much as comparable armor and always glows with a gentle radiance. While wearing this armor, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects involving radiant, cold, or necrotic damage.</text>

    <type>LA,MA,HA</type>
    <text>This armor is a dull gray, marked with flecks of gold or silver and sometimes filigreed in luminous purple swirls. While wearing this armor, you emit a trail of shadows that obscures your passage, wiping away tracks and hiding your movement. All attempts to track you are made with disadvantage, and all ranged attacks against you are also made with disadvantage. However, bright light (such as from sunlight or the daylight spell) negates both effects and makes this armor easy to see. In these conditions, all attacks made against you gain a +2 to the attack roll.</text>

    <match>Sword,Axe,Scimitar,Rapier</match>
    <text>This magic weapon has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to conjure a thick patch of shrubs, grasses, aboveground roots, and even small saplings in a 10-foot radius. The area becomes difficult terrain, and the foliage is thick enough to provide cover against ranged attacks. The growth is permanent unless you speak the command word again.
	The weapon regains all expended charges after a short or long rest.</text>

    <text>These mithral weapons are commonly found among gnomes and quicksteps, who prize their power to shed a chilling blue light on command. You can use a bonus action to speak this weapon's command word, and all creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, becoming paralyzed for 1 round on a failed saving throw and having their speed reduced to zero for 1 round on a successful one. The effect ends at the beginning of your next turn. This action cannot be used again until the next dawn.</text>

    <text>Made by shadow goblins to keep larger foes at a distance, lunar lances are often given to goblins on battlements or other vantage points. They weigh literally nothing but are as sharp as any dagger. This weapon adds 10 feet to your reach when attacking with it.</text>

    <match>Rapier,Dagger</match>
    <text>The blade of this magic weapon seems to shine from within with a pale white light. The weapon deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to any creature it hits. If the creature is not in its true form, it becomes frightened until the start of your next turn. At the start of its turn, a creature frightened in this way must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or immediately return to its true form.</text>

    <text>When you wield this weapon and a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to move to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your position without provoking opportunity attacks. If this movement would put you out of reach of the attacker, the attack is at disadvantage.</text>

    <match>Club,Hammer,Mace,Staff</match>
    <text>By speaking this weapon's command word as a bonus action, you activate a harsh purple light. While this light shines, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidate) checks made to interact with beasts, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, and monstrosities.
	In addition, any foe or object you strike with a scepter weapon glows, shedding dim light in a 10\-foot radius. Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.</text>
