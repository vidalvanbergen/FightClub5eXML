Bearfolk druids provide frontline defense against the corrupting influence of shadow.

Grounded Nature. Bearfolk who pursue druidic training understand the state of balance inherent in all natural creatures. Such keen inner senses provide these druids with hyperawareness of whether or not the taint of unnatural shadow magic has influenced a creature, and their insight makes these druids more resistant to any corrupting influences.

Moonlit Leaders. While bearfolk druids are common throughout all bearfolk communities in the mortal world, the highest concentration is in the Shadow Realm. Each day in the Moonlit Glades they push back against the slow, insidious influences of shadow corruption. These druids are critical to the survival of such bearfolk communities.

    <description>This gaudily dressed humanoid bear stomps on the ground to a pounding rhythm to accompany her singing.

Bearfolk thunderstompers are raucous bards that help to elevate the fight against shadow.

Jolly Big Bards. Thunderstompers tend to be jovial, loud, and larger than life. They eagerly dive into dangerous situations, confident their dancing stomps will see them through. They typically accompany their stomping with singing or chanting, flute playing, or some form of percussion instrument.

Way of the Stomp. The bearfolk developed the thunderstomper style as a way of mimicking the sounds and vibrations of giant-kin. This allowed small groups of traveling bearfolk to fool their ancient enemies and avoid dangerous encounters. Later, the dancing style was honed to generate thunderous energy.

The birch siren must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue the chorus. It can stop the chorus at any time. The tune ends if the birch siren is incapacitated. While charmed by the birch siren, a creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature cannot take actions while charmed in this way. Whenever a target takes damage or begins a turn unable to hear the chorus, it can repeat the saving throw. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this birch siren's tune for the next 24 hours.</text>

    <description>An impossibly thin figure passes through the trees, its skin and clothes formed of curling silver birch bark. The autumn leaves that adorn its crown whisper strangely in the breeze. Birch sirens are a less common variety of treant that often live together in family units called copses. These sirens are more malicious than their larger counterparts and delight in luring travelers deeper into dangerous woodland with their haunting melodies.

Shadow Wood. The largest population of birch sirens lives in the Shadow Realm, in the rarely traveled portions of forest that span the region. Occasionally, birch sirens are coerced to lend aid and protection to shadow fey rangers who hunt such dangerous woods.

Elven Origins. Birch sirens are rumored to have been created by the magic of the elves. These tree-folk were once guardians of vast orchards and beautiful gardens, contributing to the wonder of such places with their alluring songs. When the elves began to fade from the world, so too did the purpose of the birch sirens, and now they exist as cruel shadows of their former selves.

	• The apparatus expels a shower of a caustic solution in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction of the distiller's choice. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

	• The apparatus expels slick grease in a 10-foot square centered on a point the distiller chooses within 30 feet. When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.</text>

    <description>The maniacal-looking gnome before you has a large cask-shaped apparatus strapped to his back. He stares intently with jaundice-yellow eyes and a too-wide grin. Half of the gnome's once-glorious red mustache has clearly been burned away, probably by acid.

Gnomish distillers unlock the destructive secrets within alchemical reagents and brew them into highly volatile solutions.

Strange Science. Gnomish distillers are driven by the pursuit of knowledge and believe that all reagents, magical or otherwise, including shadowstuff, can be distilled to a more potent version of their natural state. The quest to unlock the secret nature hidden within all things has frequently led to catastrophic destruction in the name of natural philosophy.

Wyrd Alchemy for Sale. Wyrd gnomes embrace the darker side of invention, and gnomish distillers epitomize this trait. Distillers weaponize the knowledge gained from alchemical pursuits by creating deadly solutions, sprays, poisons, and explosives to sell to the highest bidder.

    <description>Standing just behind a pair of menacing black dogs is a shadowy figure with crossed arms. A silver whistle dangles from his smirking lips. The evil-looking yellow light shining in his eyes is mirrored by the growling hounds.

Keepers of hounds are humanoids blessed by the shadow fey with the ability to form magical bonds with the hunting hounds bred in the Shadow Realm.

Born to Lead. While extensive training is required to become a keeper of hounds, most keepers are born with an innate affinity for beasts. Fey children who demonstrate skill with beast handling are quickly apprenticed to keepers in hopes of developing their talents.

Valued Courtiers. Hunting is a beloved pastime of shadow fey nobles, so maintaining a keeper of hounds as part of a noble's household staff confers great prestige. Beasts bred in the Shadow Realm tend toward evil dispositions, making the keeper's controlling influence all the more valuable.

    <description>Before your eyes, the tall, spiraling column of closely packed ravens transforms into a pale-skinned woman, wearing a feathered cloak.

Blessed by the shadow fey, keepers of ravens are humanoids who bond with the ravens native to the Shadow Realm. These gifted few learn how to see through the birds' eyes and even transform their bodies into feathered swarms.

Master Informants. Keepers of ravens are prized as spies and informants throughout the faerie courts. While most natives know to steer clear of a raven's watchful eye, visitors to the courts often have no idea their activities can be monitored this way.

Solitary Pursuit. While these keepers are in demand as spies, they are unpopular in most social circles. Forming the bond required to pursue their magic means keepers spend vastly more time socializing with beasts than with other fey, which isolates them from the politics of court.

    <description>A grey-skinned figure in an impressive suit of reflective black plate armor towers over you. The cruelness of the spikes of his tower shield are matched only by his sneering smirk.

Humanoids who dwell in the Shadow Realm sometimes pursue the path of a shadow knight to better serve their liege lords. Blessed by the shadow fey, these glorified bruisers are dark reflections of the cavaliers who protect the mortal world.

Dark Arms. Knights of shadow carry shadow fey forged swords and shields imbued with potent magic. Merely touching the surface of these armaments is enough to drain warmth and vitality.

Sensory Training. Every knight of shadows is trained to fight in magically dark conditions, so they are equipped to deal with the many light-manipulating creatures who haunt the Shadow Realm. They combine their talents for blind fighting with their magical control of darkness to get the drop on unsuspecting foes.

These nightmarish creatures are smaller, weaker versions of the lunar devil (see Tome of Beasts),
lazy and boastful fiends that draw strength from the light of the moon. Lesser lunar devils are often found serving their more powerful brethren, sent as advance scouts to spy on a druid circle their master intends to subvert, or to identify the werewolf pack leader that must be removed before the lunar devil can seize control of the pack.

Blessed by shadow fey, hags, or other magical creatures, memory thieves are humanoids who are trained in the art of magically capturing the memories and knowledge of other creatures.

Headhunters. The art of stealing memories first originated in the Shadow Realm in response to the shadow fey's demand for distilled emotions and experiences. While many fey would claim they bargain fairly for the memories they enjoy, the black market for their wares continues to thrive.

Trade Network. While memory thieves have perfected the art of stealing memories, they rely on others to refine and store their acquisitions, to package and sell them. For this reason, memory thieves are almost always in the employ of a shadow fey, hag, enchanter, or other capable spellcaster with the proper tools to distill memories.

    <description>This small, black-furred humanoid has oversized clawed hands, clamped together in a nervous gesture. His tiny eyes stare at you from behind a pair of thick spectacles positioned on his long pink nose.

Very little is known about the secretive molefolk, and this reclusive race prefers it that way.

Subterranean Hermits. Molefolk are solitary creatures and fiercely defend their territories from intruders and other molefolk. These possessive individuals dig out intricate systems of tunnels to serve as their private strongholds. Every couple of years, a molefolk meets up with others of its species to mate, but otherwise, they are perfectly content to expand their underground homes in solitude.

Reluctant Guides. A molefolk's ability to quickly create underground tunnels fit for travel is unparalleled. This talent attracts interest from cunning or desperate travelers hoping to sneak into or out of dangerous regions. A molefolk can occasionally be convinced or coerced to offer their skills.

Moonshadow catchers are shadow goblins who have learned to magically bend the transitions between light and darkness.

Goblin Leaders. Moonshadow catchers are feared and respected by other shadow goblins and tend to hold leadership positions in goblin clans or settlements. Young shadow goblins are raised on tales of moonshadow catchers, stealing and devouring the shadows of children who disobey their elders.

Shadow Manipulation. Moonshadow catchers'
powers rely entirely on manipulating their own shadow and the shadows attached to the creatures around them. By using their own shadows as an additional appendage, a catcher can cling to walls and other difficult surfaces, much like a spider.

    <description>Oma Rattenfanger, Keeper of the Plain

Oma Rattenfanger resembles a small, plump, motherly elf with a kind smile and cold, wicked eyes. She wears a wellmade, clean but slightly worn dress with a large skirt and a matching bonnet-style cap.

Oma's slightly iridescent wings give away that she was once a pixie, though her time in the Shadow Realm has significantly changed her. The fey has a fondness for young lost souls who make their way to the Shadow Realm, and she eagerly takes them under her wing.

Tenebrous Plain. Oma Rattenfanger staked her claim in the Tenebrous Plain a great time ago. Since then, the plain has grown and shifted under her care, giving her orphans a home where they can thrive. With the addition of other creatures over the centuries, Oma's power in the Tenebrous Plain has only grown. Her home is a small, thatched hut that can appear wherever she wants on the plain.

    <description>Poised in thoughtful contemplation is an androgenous, elfin figure holding an intricately wrought spyglass. White-gold curls fall to their shoulders, and their brow is encircled by motes of light that glow like stars. Their outfit is a crisp white suit but overlayed with a sash colored with the pink and orange ombré of a painted sky ready to greet the rising sun.

The honorably appointed Radiant Chancellor Ectius, ambassador to the stars, is a steadfast advisor to the Court of One Million Stars. The Radiant Chancellor has served the court since its inception, long before the ruling Prince Valendan ascended to rulership. While it is strange that such an ancient and capable fey would acquiesce to the dominion of another, anyone who meets Ectius immediately understands where their true ambition lies.

Pursuit of Knowledge. Ectius is obsessed with the beauty and radiant power given to stars. Over the thousands of years they have existed, Ectius has sacrificed material pleasures, social status, and personal identity to pursue ultimate cosmic knowledge. The chancellor's efforts have been rewarded, for they have learned hundreds of true names for the stars that hang in the heavens. With the acquisition of each name, Ectius grows in power, for to know a star's true name is to have dominion over them. For now, the Radiant Chancellor is content to serve and advise the members of the royal court.

    <description>A tall, slender giant wades knee-deep through the river, holding a glowing fishing net in his hand.

Shorter and slimmer than most other giants, river giants are found living along riverbanks throughout the Shadow Realm and in the mortal world where waterways cross or run alongside the shadow roads.

River Travelers. Capable boat pilots, these introspective giants sometimes transport travelers up and down the rivers of the Shadow Realm in their wooden skiffs, but they are most often found wading through the water with their glistening mooncatcher's nets (see Chapter 10). The giants use the nets to pull bits of souls and memories from the river. These fragments are bottled and traded to wizards and alchemists who use them to make memory philters (see Chapter 10) and other potions.

    <description>A charming grey cobblestone bridge arches over a stream of black brackish water. Crawling up and over the sides of the bridge, tendrils of thick black water coalesce into a helmed warrior bearing a sword—which it points toward you, as if daring you to use the bridge.

River spirits are fey guardians that defend bridges and other crossing points over bodies of water.

Stubborn Guardians. River spirits are called into existence by the magic between water and shore, and they often appear quite suddenly, claiming a crossing point without any warning. Some river spirits allow travelers to pass over their bridges freely, but possessive or ornery spirits might bring all crossing to a complete standstill with challenges or demands. Since river spirits cannot truly die once they have bound themselves to a bridge, getting them to leave inevitably requires negotiation or powerful banishing magic.

Unwavering Loyalty. While river spirits are difficult to reason with, particularly patient or persuasive creatures can forge a friendly bond with them. River spirits may adjust their demands or even agree to guard different crossing points at the request of such a friend. Those who forge such a relationship gain their unwavering loyalty, and such a stout guardian may defend a location often long after the instigating creature has died. Fey bard often name and know of particular river spirits.

    </action>
    <description>The creature stepping forward from the glazed clay pot is formed from thorny green vines twisted together in the shape of a humanoid torso. In its face, where eyes would be, are a set of perfect, lush roses.

Rose golems were first crafted by the fey to watch over the verdant gardens that adorn their palaces.

Gentle Watchers. Rose golems serve as ornamental caretakers of the gardens they protect, but they are also particularly suited to deal humanely with intruders. These golems do not kill unwelcome visitors but rather lull them into enchanted sleep before delivering them to their masters. Such delicate enchantments allow for the removal of nosy mortals and other garden pests.

Prized Creations. The creation of a rose golem is as much a matter of artistry as it is of magic. Fey, gnomes, and elves with a talent for floral arrangement spend a great deal of time weaving, arranging, and pruning these constructs to beautify them. This level of effort leads to a wide variety of rose golems, who sport different floral varietals, patterns, and colors. It is not uncommon for fey nobility to parade their rose golems around during summer garden parties.

    <description>The elfin figure before you has plaited black hair and silver skin. She looks world-weary as she leans heavily on a staff of white wood topped with a mote of silver light. Everything about her feels faded and grey, as if washed out by the gloom of the world.

Sable elves have an innate affinity for arcane magic. Long ago, they were exiled from the dwindling elven empire, and now the survivors of this dying race wander the dark places of the world, searching for purpose.

Blood Affinity. Every sable elf is born with an affinity for magic. As a sable elf matures, it becomes clear which school of magic they are particularly suited to, and they gain the innate ability to cast spells from the associated school of magic.

Fallen to Shadow. The few sable elves that remain possess the last vestiges of powerful elven magic that helped shape the early phases of the world, and they guard their secrets in isolation. Their powerful capabilities allow these ancient elves to survive in almost any climate, and the dark forests of the Shadow Realm house a handful of these wanderers.

    <description>A bald, silver-skinned elfin woman dressed in decorative robes made of layers of black, grey, and white gauze strikes an imposing figure before you. The top portion of her face is covered by a midnight-blue and silver mask that extends upward into an elaborate, feathered headdress. As her hands twist in an arcane gesture, you note the eyes tattooed upon her palms.

Sable elves who are discontent to wander in disgrace often seek to join the cult of Hecate, the goddess who presides over witchcraft.

Arcane Advisors. Hecate only grants the powers of hierophant to the most cunning, powerful, and charismatic of her worshippers. This combination of requirements makes a hierophant an attractive advisor and religious guide to magically inclined societies. Sable elf hierophants are often seen among the royal courts of the shadow fey or in other elite social circles.

Witch Queen. Hecate is regarded as one of the oldest of the gods, and her worship dates back before the elves settled the mortal world. While her popularity has waxed and waned over the epochs, small covens of practitioners who praise her name have consistently existed across all geographic regions and cultures.

    <description>A grey-skinned elfin man steps from behind a black tree.

He has a dagger held in his teeth and is casually juggling two more daggers. The figure's rough-looking traveling gear and leathers have clearly seen better days. Shadow fey who live outside the courts find their skills are suited to waylaying travelers on the shadow roads.

Criminal Outcasts. Shadow fey who dwell at court obsessively pursue both leisure and politics, so they find the idea of professional crime boorish at best. Shadow fey finding themselves relying on banditry are often forced to make difficult decisions due to banishment or desperation.

Strength In Numbers. The Shadow Realm is a dangerous place to wander alone, so shadow fey bandits often keep company with a wide array of creatures. It is not uncommon to find shadow fey bandits working with darakhul, monstrous fey, or in the service of hags.

    <description>A large, purple-skinned goblin lumbers toward you. He is easily twice the width, height, and weight of any typical goblin, and he clutches a heavy, bejeweled axe in his ham-sized fists.

Shadow goblin chieftains rule goblin groups with a hearty mix of intimidation and natural charisma.

Court Players. Shadow goblins thrive in the courts of the shadow fey and in their own courts and have built a complicated social network that mirrors fey politics. Shadow goblin chieftains are drawn from the ranks of the largest, eldest, and most cunning goblins.

Shadow Hierarchy. In shadow goblin clans or families, shadow goblin chieftains are second in power only to the moonshadow catchers, who wield strange and potent magic. Frequently a chieftain and a moonshadow catcher will work together to claim leadership of wealth or resources. This common arrangement is called a moon-chief clan. Others are either chieftain clans or moon-led clans.

    <description>The boney, purple-skinned goblin with bright-yellow eyes pushes a pair of gold spectacles farther up on her long nose. She wears a flowy grey shirt stained with black blotches of ink. And she looks annoyed by the sudden interruption.

Shadow goblin scribes are the notaries and executors of deals brokered between shadow fey and mortals.

Contracts, Oaths &amp; Consequences. Shadow fey nobility possess notoriously short attention spans and have come to rely on shadow goblin scribes to record and enforce the day-to-day drudgeries associated with complex contracts. After a fey accepts a bargain, they call upon the scribe to work out the exact terms, catalog them, and occasionally deal with those desperate enough to attempt to break a contract (see shadow goblin chieftain above for the consequences of goblins breaking some such contracts and oaths).

Limited Spellcasting. Shadow fey are careful not to teach their goblin servitors too much magic, but scribes learn a small selection of practical spells that allow them to deal with testy mortals. Scribes are often the messengers of bad news, and their magic allows them to subdue aggressive individuals long enough to accomplish their business.

    <description>This mass of fist-sized black spiders flows like a creeping mist. While they move like a shadow across the ground, they do not cast one themselves.

Born of Darkness. Shadowspiders are not alive in the traditional sense. A shadowspider swarm is a creeping mass of spiders formed out of the primordial darkness of the Shadow Realm itself. They are born in the oldest and darkest regions of the Shadow Realm, often in areas where the planar barriers have grown thin. Unable to survive outside of its swarm, a shadowspider separated from its swarm evaporates in a greasy swirl of black smoke.

Affinity with Undeath. While shadowspider swarms form in places where two planes are close, they are particularly common in regions where the Shadow Realm is coterminous with the Plane of Undeath. Because of this, shadowspider swarms are often found alongside the undead that sometimes spill forth in these regions.

    <description>An elderly woman with wispy strands of grey hair is in the process of pulling up a black needle from a stitch made on the cloth that sits on the table before her. The black cloth shifts strangely as if something moves just beneath it.

Blessed by the fey of the Shadow Realm, umbral tailors are master crafters who repair far more than mundane clothing.

Niche Profession. Umbral tailors can only be found in the Shadow Realm, where their gifts for healing and repairing damage caused by corruption are most needed. For whatever reason, umbral tailors' soul stitching magic only works in the Shadow Realm.

Soul Stitching. Umbral tailors can see the souls of living creatures (if they possess one), and this ability allows them to identify psychic and physical ailments affecting their clients. Much like a mundane tailor, umbral tailors can stitch together torn souls, use shadow ephemera to patch damaged areas, and occasionally enhance a healthy soul.

Healing Hearts. Bards and others sometimes tell tales of the "Umbral Tailor of Corremel," who is said to have been able to stitch together a broken heart, to mend the grief of a widow or widower, or to patch together the shredded soul of parents whose child has died. Few umbral tailors claim any such extraordinary level of skill, but the stories persist, and some tailors take advantage of those who seek hope and healing.
