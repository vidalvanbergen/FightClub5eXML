        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Prophet (Third Party)</name>
        <text>Monks who follow the Way of the Prophet refuse to cloister the wisdom they have learned. They are driven to spread their knowledge to all the peoples of the land. Some are set on this path by divine intervention. Others take up the prophet's mantle out of a sense of personal obligation, and they all share a deep-rooted faith that empowers their actions.

        <text>Whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, you can use your reaction to roll a Charisma (Performance or Persuasion) ability check.
