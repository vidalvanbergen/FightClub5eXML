        <name>Otherworldly Patron: Mother of Sorrows (Third Party)</name>
        <text>Universal suffering has given rise to an enigmatic being known as the Mother of Sorrows, and warlocks who bind themselves to her cause seek to spread her poisonous vengeance. The Mother of Sorrows was born from the suffering of parents who have lost children to pestilence, disease, and treachery, and her gifts grant warlocks the power to avenge the thousands of sorrows laid at her feet.

        <name>Poison Soul (Mother of Sorrows (Third Party))</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, your affinity for poison becomes supernatural. Any poison damage you deal ignores any resistance or immunity.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Venomous Mark (Mother of Sorrows (Third Party))</name>
        <text>Also at 1st level, as a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you deal an extra 1d6 poison damage to the target whenever you hit it with a spell attack. (You can only apply this damage once per spell even if there are multiple spell attack instances, such as with eldritch blast.)
	If the target drops to 0 hit points before the curse ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to curse a new creature. Only one creature can be affected with a venomous mark at any given time.

        <name>Sickening Revenge (Mother of Sorrows (Third Party))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can take vengeance on those who harm you. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to attempt to poison the creature that damaged you. The triggering creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or become poisoned for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
