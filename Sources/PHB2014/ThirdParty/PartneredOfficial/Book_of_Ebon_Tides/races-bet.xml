The shadow chewers are said to have first pursued shadow fey into darkness and found their planar bolt-hole.
	They soon realized the war against the undead and the shadow fey would never succeed unless they could at least understand the Shadow Realm. In time, the first druids, rangers, and other bearfolk visitors to the Shadow Realm built settlements full of light, built warding stones, and grew entire circles of moonlit oaks, gathering the strength of their intimate understanding of darkness to prevent evil from ruling the shadows without rivals. The moon wells, the groves, and the mere presence of the bearfolk have all given the Shadow Realm places of refuge.

All bearfolk share an inherent iron resolve, but none more so than those who call the Shadow Realm their home. The bearfolk who hail from the Moonlit Glades are hardened by a life of constant peril—the ever-present battle against shadow corruption. Only by banding together in tight-knit communities dedicated to fulfilling their noble purpose have the bearfolk miraculously continued to thrive.
	Since Mesikämmen the Bear King issued his fateful decree, the bearfolk have fought as a source of light in the Shadow Realm. While most of the region is deadly to even the most capable of travelers, the bearfolk have carved out pockets of safety guarded by druidic magic.
	Hard-won wisdom has taught the bearfolk the secrets of resisting and purifying shadow corruption. As their mission to drive back the darkness has grown over the centuries, generations of bearfolk have been born in the Shadow Realm. And the longer they stay, the more of each new generation shows an innate power to shape the darkness that surrounds them.

As a shadowborn bearfolk, you are one of the cubs born in the Shadow Realm with a proclivity for the darkness. Shadowborn are marked by gray coats from infancy and sometimes possess strangely arcane black markings. Shadowborn not only seem to resist the darkness more easily than other bearfolk but are also often drawn to its presence.

	Living flesh is scarce in the Shadow Realm, so while the darakhul still hunt the living denizens of the plane and maintain elaborate trade networks to secure living cargo from mortal lands, they have discovered that the crackling trees—an invasive species originating in Evermaw—can assuage much of their hunger, and they have learned to subsist on the bloodlike sap drawn from these trees. This practice marks them though, for the corruption inherent in the flora causes a permanent blackening of the teeth, recession of the gums, and shriveling of the flesh around the mouth. As a result, the darakhul of the Shadow Realm are much less concerned with concealing their true nature. After all, they are far from the worst things that stalk the darkness.

Their surnames, however, tend to be granted or chosen by the newly arrived darakhul after the Crossing (their passage into undeath). These are sometimes the name of a patron, lord, or lady, or a name used within the legions of the empire or within a particular faith. Some common lineage names are provided below. Some names are most common in the priesthoods while others are from the legions.
	Outside of those areas, surnames often celebrate particular affiliations in the trades or mark a tie to a founder of particular note. Because of this naming custom, different darakhul can end up with the same surname due to being chosen by the same patron, being part of the same temple, being the spawn of another darakhul, or some other similar circumstance.
	Ghouls created outside the influence of the Twilight Empire might take on surnames related to their personal goals, keep their original surnames if attempting to regain some semblance of their previous life, or forgo a surname to avoid ties to the past, a church, or a patron.

Darakhul Surnames of the Priesthood: Al-Mot, Al-Qaan, Akma-aldan, Bloodtide, Vardeson.

Still, most of a darakhul's cosmetic features, such as supple skin or a long beard, fade over time into the gaunt, skull-like face, fanged maw, and taut gray skin of a ghoulish undead.</text></trait><trait category="description"><name>Playing a Darakhul Character</name><text>Life as the ravenous undead comes with challenges for an adventurer. People revile the darakhul universally as scavengers at best and as loathsome, murdering abominations at worst. For such a being, participating as a member of an adventuring party is complicated.
	One of the touchstones that provides stability in your new form is your old life. While you have urges and thoughts that are dark and terrible, memories and feelings from your life before undeath might resurface to help you cope. Sometimes these flashes are corrupted versions of your old self, manifesting in your mind in new ways. Other times the recollections and feelings bubble up unfiltered, reminding you of a time when you were alive. Both are painful, but pain can be instructive.
	A major question you have to answer when you play a darakhul is, "How am I dealing with the change that transformed me into a darakhul?" Have you fully accepted your new situation, embracing your new powers and hungers as a boon? Do you fight against your urges daily, seeking to return to your old self? What were your goals -
before your transformation, and do you still pursue them? Are your new goals simply about survival, or are those aspirations a twisted reflection of the goals you had as a living creature?
	Regardless of your current monstrous state, who you once were has a powerful effect on who you are now. The carefree spirit of a halfling, the fiendish urges of a tiefling, or the creative spark of a gnome: all of these do not leave you simply because of your new form. How do those traits manifest themselves in you now?
	There is a great deal of narrative, dramatic, and roleplaying potential in that tension between the old self and the new. Darakhul may be undead, but they still must function in their own society—be it on the surface or in the empires beneath the surface. Most still have jobs to do and dreams to fulfill within their societies.

Your darakhul character was a bearfolk before transforming into a darakhul. While your allegiance has changed, your mission to create order amid the darkness has not. The strength and tenacity of the darakhul are comfortingly familiar.

These are sometimes the name of a patron, lord, or lady, or a name used within the legions of the empire or within a particular faith. Some common lineage names are provided below. Some names are most common in the priesthoods while others are from the legions.
	Outside of those areas, surnames often celebrate particular affiliations in the trades or mark a tie to a founder of particular note. Because of this naming custom, different darakhul can end up with the same surname due to being chosen by the same patron, being part of the same temple, being the spawn of another darakhul, or some other similar circumstance.
	Ghouls created outside the influence of the Twilight Empire might take on surnames related to their personal goals, keep their original surnames if attempting to regain some semblance of their previous life, or forgo a surname to avoid ties to the past, a church, or a patron.

Darakhul Surnames of the Priesthood: Al-Mot, Al-Qaan, Akma-aldan, Bloodtide, Vardeson.

Darakhul Surnames of the Legions: Bonecracker, Ivory, Maggot, Mortus, Reaver, Secondus.

Traditional Darakhul Surnames: Blackwater, Bloodborn, Calva, Canis, Carver, Corvan, Dawnbinder, Demonfinder, Edlest, Fuligin, Ghost, Gnollfeeder, Hunter, Jaeger, Miner, Orcandus, Osseor, Ravenfeeder, Shadowsmith, Strigator, Styxdrinker, Tanner, Umbro, Unsated, Verskull, Vespertan, Whispersen, Wormsong, Wraithcaller.</text>

      <name>Darakhul Characters</name>
      <text>Both ordinary ghouls and darakhul arise from the infected corpses of other races. Most traits of the previous race are gone when the creature rises as a darakhul, though each darakhul carries some traits of their previous form. Still, most of a darakhul's cosmetic features, such as supple skin or a long beard, fade over time into the gaunt, skull-like face, fanged maw, and taut gray skin of a ghoulish undead.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Playing a Darakhul Character</name>
      <text>Life as the ravenous undead comes with challenges for an adventurer. People revile the darakhul universally as scavengers at best and as loathsome, murdering abominations at worst. For such a being, participating as a member of an adventuring party is complicated.
	One of the touchstones that provides stability in your new form is your old life. While you have urges and thoughts that are dark and terrible, memories and feelings from your life before undeath might resurface to help you cope. Sometimes these flashes are corrupted versions of your old self, manifesting in your mind in new ways. Other times the recollections and feelings bubble up unfiltered, reminding you of a time when you were alive. Both are painful, but pain can be instructive.
	A major question you have to answer when you play a darakhul is, "How am I dealing with the change that transformed me into a darakhul?" Have you fully accepted your new situation, embracing your new powers and hungers as a boon? Do you fight against your urges daily, seeking to return to your old self? What were your goals -
before your transformation, and do you still pursue them? Are your new goals simply about survival, or are those aspirations a twisted reflection of the goals you had as a living creature?
	Regardless of your current monstrous state, who you once were has a powerful effect on who you are now. The carefree spirit of a halfling, the fiendish urges of a tiefling, or the creative spark of a gnome: all of these do not leave you simply because of your new form. How do those traits manifest themselves in you now?
	There is a great deal of narrative, dramatic, and roleplaying potential in that tension between the old self and the new. Darakhul may be undead, but they still must function in their own society—be it on the surface or in the empires beneath the surface. Most still have jobs to do and dreams to fulfill within their societies.

      <text>Shadow fey are the most abundant and established of the races who dwell in the Shadow Realm. They were long ago stolen away from the Bright Lands with promises of power. To outsiders, however, their origins are steeped in mystery. The shadow fey rule from their various courts fraught with intrigue and social maneuvering.
	Shadow fey are immune to the shadow corruption that threatens those from the mortal world, but this protection comes at a cost. Above all else, shadow fey want to experience the tantalizing emotions and passions that do not come easily to them. Plenty of courtly resources go toward the cultivation and trade of these emotions made tangible by fey magic.
	Outside of the courts, shadow fey have built magnificent lantern-lit cities and fortresses that mark crossroads throughout the Shadow Realm. They have a deep knowledge of this dark land, and a long history with its powers, places, and secrets.
	A shadow fey character could easily be a minor noble from the courts of the shadow fey, from one of the handful of cities of the Shadow Realm, or from a remote outpost, where those deemed unfit for politics are trained to be scouts and hunters. Shadow fey resemble elves physically but with some striking differences. Their skin color tends toward alabaster white, ebon black, or subtle grays. Many have horns that range widely in size and shape.

      <text>Lunar elves are an offshoot of shadow fey and are quite rare, and their births are typically regarded as an auspicious omen. If the origin of the shadow fey is mysterious, then that of the lunar elves is even more so, though many lunar elves have been recently drawn toward the Moonlit King, seeking out this exiled sovereign. Always born under the light of the full moons, these shadow fey seem saturated with its light. Lunar elves are not automatically ostracized from the shadow fey courts, but many prefer to take up duties that remove themselves from the watchful eyes of the shadow fey nobles: serving as an emissary to the Moonlit Glades, taking up residence in the Starry Court, or training to hunt the beasts of the region is often preferable to the suspicious gaze of the Queen of Night and Magic.
	Lunar elves are identical in appearance to shadow fey except their skin glows in the dark, and they have luminous silver eyes. While lunar elves can learn to suppress this glowing effect, moments of strong emotion tend to reveal their true natures. The horns of lunar elves tend to be long, spiraled, and pearlescent.

      <text>When the elves first began to decline, some chose to stand their ground while others accepted a pact with the shadows. And then there were the sable elves who simply chose to run. Unfortunately, this splinter group of indecisive elves quickly made enemies, and they were scorned by the elves who had seized the opportunity to forge a shadow pact. So now, these sable elves are scattered about the realms in perpetua disgrace, not belonging anywhere. However, they have one redoubt of their own, the Court of Golden Oak.
	The few sable elves that remain possess the last vestiges of powerful elven magic that helped shape the early phases of the world, and they guard their secrets in isolation. Since there are so few of these elves remaining and only one community to speak of, the sable elf lineage is rapidly dying out. Their power allows these ancient elves to survive in almost any climate, and the dark forests of the Shadow Realm house a handful of these wanderers.
	Sable elves are dark-eyed, often either red-haired or raven-haired, and silver-skinned. They have tall, willowy frames, similar to other elves. Most carry an irrepressible aura of world-weariness.

You are an elf with a deeper affinity for elven magic that sets you apart from most other elves.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Shadow goblins evolved to thrive in the Shadow Realm as servitors and allies of the shadow fey. In time, they founded their own city and have cut their own path. These goblins are closer to fey than they are to their monstrous cousins in the mortal lands, and they possess cunning dispositions that allow them to integrate into the shadow courts. They are often blue- or purple-skinned and with bright orange or yellow eyes. And they have a knack for blending into shadows. Good rogues and even better assassins, shadow goblins have a dark reputation but also delight in low humor, drunkenness, roughhousing and wrestling, and other feats of skill (which they often lose.
	Shadow goblins are masters of deception and learn from infancy to take advantage of those who would underestimate them. These creatures share the natural resistance shadow fey have to the corrupting influence of the Shadow Realm, and they demonstrate a surprising affinity for shadow weaving and lunar magic. Naturally, their knack for magic is something most shadow goblins keep as an advantageous secret.

You are a shadow goblin, forever changed by the Shadow Realm, setting you apart from other goblins.

      <name>Shadow Goblin Names</name>
      <text>Individual names among the shadow goblins tend to be suggestive of either darkness or whimsy—or better yet, both—as those two facets play such important roles in their day-to-day lives. Many actually feel it a personal flaw to share a given name with anyone else, so they take great pains to name their children something entirely unique. Family names tend to focus much more on utility, another important facet to shadow goblins lives, and are much more descriptive.

Example Male Names: Bollair, Bruddaq, Desolay, Dessoto, Falko, Farsight, Fringo, Messerino, Picklo, Stinko, Thundero, Twisp.

Example Female Names: Daniy, Jojoni, Lunara, Morrameko, Nona, Olara, Omagda, Pippi, Sihaddra, Tippita, Vellissa.

Example Family Names: Bellringer, Butcherson, Candlesmith, Cloudchaser, Cooperson, Foxskinner, Glimmerfetch, Goldbiter, Ironbeater, Marshhound, Moonshine, Netmender, Potlicker, Potmaker, Seasalt, Shepherdsdottir, Skullsniffer, Tailshipper, Wargbender, Weaselwise, Weaverson.</text>

      <text>The Shadow Realm twists beings with its magic, and in the case of the umbral humans, this influence can have radical effects. These umbral folk are not merely humans corrupted by shadow but rather slowly transformed by their exposure to shadow over generations, gradually becoming inured to it. These are the changelings.
	Beyond shadow's natural and inevitable influence, the shadow fey have long experimented with the shadows and its effects on mortals, whether to punish the foolish or to create better servants—or just for fun-and some umbral humans, those that survive, are the result of these rituals. These twisted souls are often labeled as the gifted by others, but they rarely if ever think of themselves in such terms.

The generational infusion of shadow manifests itself in different ways, but two especially noteworthy categories of umbral humans exist: changelings and the gifted.

      <name>Changelings</name>
      <text>Changelings are the natural result of humans adapting to a life in the shadows over multiple generations. Originally, humans were stolen from the mortal lands to serve their shadow fey masters—or just on a whim—and many more humans simply got lost on a shadow road or abandoned and ultimately became stranded in the Shadow Realm. And that new life in shadows must ultimately change a mortal.
	Changelings resemble their cousins from the mortal lands but with the hallmarks of a life in the shadows, similar to how shadow fey differ from other elves. Their skin color tends toward alabaster white, ebon black, or subtle grays. Some have even grown rudimentary horns, like shadow fey. Their appearance may change further in generations to come-perhaps constantly evolving and even drastically diverging in some ways.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Changeling Names</name>
      <text>Changelings typically take on the naming customs of the dominant peoples in the communities they grow up in. Where umbral humans are concentrated, the newcomers will often retain naming customs from the mortal lands from whence they originated—if their memories remain—while long-settled umbral human families use an amalgam of naming customs. For those communities of long standing within shadow, the naming follows a blend of styles in a linguistic melting pot.

Male Umbral Human Names: Abradal, Dalid, Haggar, Hosano, Juns, Korim, Masoosh, Obrax, Ulaf, Woldemar.

Female Umbral Human Names: Analinda, Breck, Cloria, Helgamet, Linnet, Maswen, Nuriam, Ranna, Siffar, Soffy, Ulsa.</text>

      <name>The Gifted</name>
      <text>Dealing with the fey is dangerous, and the gifted are living proof. These broken souls are those umbral humans that have drunk a bit too deeply, too quickly, of the shadows. This transformation is often initiated by the shadow fey, though not always, for there are many dark powers in the shadows. It could be an unwilling change, forced upon an unfortunate soul, or it could be in payment for some fey pact, whether as boon or bane.
	The gifted can vary widely in their physical appearance, depending on the nature of the change. Sometimes they appear as "normal" umbral humans and sometimes they'll appear as shadow fey. Still other times, the change can cause minor cosmetic changes or even more dramatic and severe changes: tails, hooves, vestigial wings, and the like are not unknown—not to mention the mental and emotional alterations that can accompany them. No matter how small the physical change though, a gifted always bears some sign visible to at least themselves.

	• You no longer need to eat or breathe to survive and require only 4 hours for a long rest. Gain one level of exhaustion. This level of exhaustion cannot be removed by any means magical or non-magical.

	• Cut your current base movement speed in half. Gain a fly, swim, or climb speed equal to your newly halved base movement speed.

      <text>Quicksteps were among the servitors the shadow fey brought with them when they first came to the Shadow Realm. Like the shadow fey, quicksteps are innately resilient to the corruption that infuses the area, and they embrace life in the courts with aplomb. Most quicksteps have a fondness for finery and feel right at home amid the riches of court life. As their name implies, quicksteps possess a natural affinity for speed, which makes them exquisitely qualified for two favored shadow fey pastimes: sabotage and dueling.
	Quicksteps are rarely found outside the fey courts but have thriving communities within many of the courts, most notably in the Court of Midnight Teeth and the Court of Winter's Love. Yet quicksteps are not immune to the wanderlust most fey experience. These small fey make for skilled and efficient adventurers and are typically welcome in any company hoping to traverse the dangerous Shadow Realm.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>In recent decades, the squirrel-like beings called ratatosk have grown bored with simply safeguarding the World Tree and have decided to more actively battle corruption in the Shadow Realm. Being exuberant sentinels against all things evil—and having large personalities—ratatosks are often at odds with many of the Shadow Realm natives.
	Ratatosks are insatiable tricksters. Sharing gossip from across the planes, they delight in learning secrets and spreading those tidbits of information in mischievous ways. Resembling squirrels with sleek fur and small tusks, they form close matriarchal familial units called drays within larger communities called scurries. More adventurous ratatosks often act as planar guides and guardians, though it is not uncommon to find squirrel-folk offering their services as couriers, thieves, or even spies.

The tradvakt, also called ratatosk warlords, believe themselves to be the guardians and protectors of Yggdrasil and the branches of the World Tree. Larger than their ekorre cousins, the tradvakt train from a young age to master weapons and battle tactics. They act to maintain order in their communities and stamp out dangers that threaten those settlements.
	Tradvakt who become adventurers do so for a wide variety of reasons. Some seek a more proactive way to combat evil before it can threaten the World Tree. Others simply wish to prove their martial skills. No matter the reason, tradvakt will rise to any challenge and be victorious.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The erina are a race of bipedal folk that resemble hedgehogs. Originally hailing from the Bright Lands, the shadow fey brought erinas along as servitors when they first came to the Shadow Realm, where they quickly adapted to the shadows and have learned to thrive in the dark forests and underground warrens. Their natural propensity for exploration and their unrivaled burrowing skills mean that they've tunneled their way to many a strange new localeincluding the mortal realms. They've primarily settled around the plateau that hosts the Queen's Wood and the Silver Hills, but regular bands of explorers, naturalists, and wilderness guides have established underground camps throughout the realm.
	The shadow fey are not entirely pleased by the erinas' wanderlust (making them less than entirely useful servants) nor with their open policy of assisting travelers in and out of the Shadow Realm through their underground shadow roads. However, at least for now, it is easier for the shadow fey to ignore these aspects of the crafty survivalists.
	Spiritfarer erinas are a subrace of erina. You can find out more about the base erina race in Tome of Heroes.

You are a spiritfarer erina, whose ancestors were forever changed by the Shadow Realm, setting you apart from most other erina. You exhibit a few different traits from typical erinas.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Curious</name>
      <text>Erina are a highly intelligent species whose natural curiosity and cunning serve them well. They are always probing around the limits of their territory and keep a careful record of their environment. Erina seem supernaturally aware of their surroundings and have a keen eye for things that are out of place or novel.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Scroungers</name>
      <text>Erina subsist by scrounging. In the wild, their diet consists of fruit, roots, insects, and small animals that come within range of their spears. The few erina who make their homes in cities live in much the same way. For this reason, erina sometimes run afoul of the law, though they are not naturally greedy.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Defenders of Hearth and Home</name>
      <text>The erina generally worship deities focused on the hearth and home. The tenets of such deities regarding defense of home align very well with the erina's territorial nature. The burrows of the erina contain a dizzying number of tunnels and chambers with multiple camouflaged entrances and exits. Invading an erina burrow is a nightmarish experience, as the little defenders burrow over, under, and beside their enemies with alarming speed, striking from a freshly dug hole before retreating to safety.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Erina Abroad</name>
      <text>Erina tend to live in large communities of their own kind. Occasionally, compatible fey creatures may lair near or even within an erina burrow. On occasion, some erina are so overcome with curiosity that they leave their homes to investigate the world beyond. These adventurous erina make excellent rangers and druids, exploring the unknown wilderness with a grin and a twitching nose.
	Other times, if there is a great threat to the region where the erina have dug their burrows, the defenders of the colony embark on a mission to face the danger nose-on. On rare occasions, some erina may find their actions warrant expulsion from the burrow. Erina communities are often suspicious of warlocks and sorcerers, and members of the colony who make bargains with strange entities or who exhibit dangerous connections to powerful magic are often escorted out of the burrow.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Erina Language</name>
      <text>Erina speak their own language, a series of whirring sounds punctuated by clicks. Erina can also communicate with other erina using only twitches of the nose and whiskers, though this old nonverbal language has fallen out of fashion in recent generations. Most burrows have at least one member who speaks the Common tongue.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Erina Names</name>
      <text>Erina names translate poorly into other languages. When outside erina lands, the hedgehog-folk tend to adopt names with long, open vowel sounds. These sounds are rare in their own language and bring pleasure to their ears. Erina like to extend the vowel sounds in their names when introducing themselves.

Example Names: May-nay, Wayee, Leemay, Einore, Die-Nu, Lowno, Ur-win.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Life leaves echoes in its wake, whether crumbled remnants of a bygone civilization, tales of heroes and gods that spawn new beliefs, or even the echo of an individual soul left behind to haunt the living worla. Fantasy worlds are no strangers to ghosts and specters that linger beyond death, but sometimes a person's passion, purpose, and will to live are so strong, their tie to the living world so unbreakable, that their memories create a vessel for their soul after their body dies. These people are called shades. Shades can arise from any living race.
	There are rumors of darakhul or other undead leaving shades behind after destruction, but there are no reliable accounts of such a creature. It is more likely that an undead creature with strong enough will to become a shade becomes a shade of the race they were in true life.

You are a Stygian shade, your identity stripped by the waters of the Shadow Realm, which sets you apart from most other shades.

The River Styx winds through the Shadow Realm, full of mindless shades that live only to consume the memories of those they can drown. An unfortunate few of these shades bound to the plane retain their mental faculties yet suffer daily to recall who they once were. Shades from the Shadow Realm are different from those of the mortal realms because they specifically lack most of their memories, and the drive to find what was lost propels them. Newly born shades are difficult to distinguish from ghosts, but most settlements in the Shadow Realm are familiar enough with the phenomenon to recognize a new shade when they stumble into town with no recollection of where they came from.
	The city of Soriglass has become a haven for various undead, and shades congregate there in large numbers. It is often called the City of Shades. And a small community of shades have set up camp near the River Styx in hopes of preemptively finding and guiding the unfortunate individuals who wander out of its waters. This growing community is dedicated to helping shades of the Shadow Realm and to gathering resources to help its members discover who they once were.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Spirit and Flesh</name>
      <text>A shade possesses a physical body that looks, acts, and feels similar to a living member of their original race, at least superficially. Shades must breathe, consume food and drink, and require shelter from adverse weather. Despite the functional similarities to a living body, a shade isn't composed of flesh and blood. Their bodies are a memory of who they once were, inhabited and quickened by the presence of their soul. Exhaustion, deprivation, and injury take their toll on a shade's body, disrupting their body's ability to maintain the connection to their soul. Food, drink, and air aren't necessary to nourish their bodies but merely to help them maintain the sense of being a living, breathing creature. Similarly, shades appear to sleep, but they do not require it.
	The more injured or exhausted a shade, the less corporeal they appear. The colors of their body wash out to pale, desaturated tones, and light begins to pass through them. Blood from their wounds starts out as red and vibrant as any humanoid's, but closer to death, their wounds cease to bleed and seem to evaporate at the edges.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Living Memory</name>
      <text>The strength of a shade's memory of themselves and their place in life is the core of their being. Newer shades are almost impossible to distinguish from their prior, fully-living selves. Like anything exposed to the gnawing ravages of time, however, memory fades. The older a shade gets, the memories that keep them tethered to the living world begin to fray. They might grow forgetful, losing track of where they are or what year it is. Their memories might drift together, causing them to see people around them as figures from their past.
	Many shades keep detailed memoirs, tending to them with the same devotion that any living creature shows seeking out food and water. Shades can theoretically live forever, but in practice, the memories that tether them to life can't hold out indefinitely. Journals and other personal mementos help shades keep hold of themselves and allow them to last longer, sometimes for centuries.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Shade Adventurers</name>
      <text>Because they can arise from any people, shades come from all corners of the world and from all walks of life. Station and wealth are no guarantee to help one linger on after the body's death either. It's not unheard of for a person to die only to rise as a shade with little understanding that anything changed. Some even hide or dispose of their original remains, sometimes suppressing or deeply denying the act at all, and resume their life with no disruption. Anyone could secretly, sometimes even to themselves, be a shade.
	Some traveling shades leave their old lives behind, particularly those who were alone in life with no one to mourn them or fuel their memory. Such shades make up the majority of adventurers. Other more established shades might set out on a quest for the means to restore their true life or to protect loved ones from a threat.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Few races in Midgard live amid so much rumor, suspicion, and outright falsehood as the ravenfolk. They make their rookeries in every major city. Depending on whom you ask, they might condemn the ravenfolk as solitary wanderers bearing misfortune or praise them as messengers from the gods. Ravenfolk are loyal comrades and treacherous thieves, brave warriors and contemptible cowards. They are despised for their strange and secretive culture, and criticized for having no true culture of their own. The ravenfolk are a study in contradictions. These truths, half-truths, and lies conceal a greater mystery that few outsiders know.
	If the ravenfolk have a homeland, it is in Beldestan to the east; or a branch of Wotan's tree to the North; or on a high cliff of Horus' hidden temple in the South. They have settlements in Trollheim, Vidim, Domovogrod, Nuria Natal, and the Dragon Empire. None of these are large, but in Nuria Natal at least, they serve honorably as temple guards and as defenders of the faithful of Horus.
	Ravenfolk have no wings, but they do have tail feathers that sometimes flare out when they're angry.

You are a ravenfolk mysteriously drawn to an unknown source within the Shadow Realm, which sets you apart from most other ravenfolk.

A growing proportion of ravenfolk have joined a mystery cult in the Shadow Realm; some claim this cult is new and others that it has ancient roots and is just now being revived. These ravenfolk call themselves Seekers of the Sublime and reportedly are drawn by a mysterious psychic song. Their numbers are still few, but more arrive along the shadow roads from the mortal lands regularly, waiting for the unknown singer to reveal their intentions. This network is highly secretive about the details of their mission, but so far, they have not conducted open hostilities against the other peoples of shadow.

      <name>Of Gods and Men</name>
      <text>The ravenfolk of Midgard (also known as the huginn) are wily scoundrels, tricksters, assassins, spies, and thieves. The oldest tales say that the god Wotan the Rune Father brought the clever ravenfolk into being when he plucked the feathers from his two pet ravens, Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory), and let the feathers drift down to Midgard. The feathers became ravenfolk, and they spread across the world as Wotan's spies.
	In truth, the ravenfolk are a bridge between everyday life on Midgard and the realm of the gods. They share Wotan's secret knowledge of the branches of Yggdrasil the world tree. In the far northern reaches, the huginn are both the embodiment of the gods' will and a symbol of inevitable death in battle.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Thieves, One and All</name>
      <text>No matter what trade, role, or profession a ravenfolk takes up, they are all thieves. They build their rookeries from found items, and much like normal ravens, have a great fondness for shiny baubles. Beyond physical thievery, they live to steal secrets. Ravenfolk are naturally adept at being unobtrusive, and they use that trait to feed their insatiable curiosity. The Tsar of Vidim employs a great flock of huginn as his personal spies and assassins.
	Aside from their larcenous instincts, ravenfolk are scrupulous about keeping their word. That's not to say they don't lie; ravenfolk lie as much as anyone else, and maybe a bit more when the pressure's on. But if a promise or a vow can be extracted from one, it's as reliable as gold-which may be why ravenfolk seldom make promises or vows. Otherwise, their personalities are as varied as those of other races. They adapt readily to whatever environment they occupy, from remote wilderness to big cities-although their presence in cities is not always welcome. They frequently take on local customs, traditions, and beliefs to fit in with the community.</text>

      <name>Sublime Ravenfolk Names</name>
      <text>As with many other races whose native language is difficult for more humanlike vocal organs to deal with, ravenfolk tend to use different names among humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoids than they use among their own kind. When choosing human-friendly names, ravenfolk borrow liberally from local traditions, mythology, and popular songs and poetry. They prefer evocative names (like Starshadow, Moonglow, and Rainshimmer) over more prosaic labels, but that's as much consistency as it's possible to define. Since these aren't their real names, ravenfolk have little attachment to them.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The satarre call themselves the "devourers" or "those who end the world" due to their association with Nidhogg, the World-Eater. Others call them "Children of Nidhogg" to avoid drawing their direct attention and, frankly, out of fear for the attention. The satarre are rarely kind or compassionate; they are, at best, devoted, zealous servants of the gods of death and oblivion. More often they function directly as servants of Nidhogg, the dragon gnawing at the roots of the World Tree. Some believe the satarre have a distant connection to the dragonborn, though both sides deny any such affiliation.

You are a satarre with a tendency for plane-hopping that sets you apart from most other satarre.

Satarre are renowned planar travelers, and visits to the Shadow Realm are no exception. As the populations of races grow in the various kingdoms of shadow, so the network of gateways feeding into their shadow roads also grows. None are more aware of this than the unbound satarre, a small faction zealously dedicated to unraveling barriers between the worlds.
	The unbound satarre are a curiosity even among their own kind since they have an instinctual sensitivity to places of transition. An unbound satarre is compelled to find such gateways and widen their influence through mundane or magical means.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Some Lazy, Some Striving</name>
      <text>The satarre are powerful and wise creatures often found serving dark cults or (less often) warning other races of the plans of such cults and seeking to prevent some disaster by prophecy, guidance, and cunning.
	Most of them strive to destroy the worlds of mortals and bring about the end of all things. They are relentless in the pursuit of knowledge, of the veneration of dark gods, and in their swift action to pursue any goal that might topple the World Tree and end a corrupt age. They are often advisors to cultists and evil priests.
	However, some of the satarre are simply in no such hurry to bring on the end of all things. Other satarre call these renegade satarre the latje, "the slothful ones. "Though not outwardly different from other satarre, the latje often see little purpose in destruction for its own sake, or they see their role as warning others of the dangers of the dark gods and the widening grasp of the cold, uncaring Void. Most latje are exiled from their communities or seek the company of other races, rather than remaining close to the world-ending ambitions of most of their kind. Their numbers have always been small.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Planar Travelers</name>
      <text>The satarre know the many worlds and their connections, and they are familiar with shadow, planar doorways, and similar arcana. They are comfortable speaking with demons, devils, and heralds of darkness, for their people have long been those who turn grand and maleficent visions into plans suitable for action.
	All satarre have a deep hatred of the volmar (also called the Children of Yggdrasil [see Creature Codex]) and the ravenfolk (see Midgard Heroes Handbook), for these two have long opposed the satarre's efforts on behalf of darkness and destruction.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Strong Void Speakers</name>
      <text>The satarre are speakers of Void Speech, the language of the Great Old Ones and of creatures that live in the darkness between stars, and the whispers and invocations of dark gods that drive others mad seem not to trouble the satarre. The satarre are a friend to the darakhul, tieflings, and vampires, and satarre and derro always seem to understand one another.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Unbound Satarre Names</name>
      <text>Like other satarre, unbound satarre names often resemble names of the cultures where they are raised, though satarre raised on the planes or in cults of darkness or death tend toward names common to those planes or that invoke the cult's tenets. Names in Void Speech are also common and are presented below.
	All satarre are given cult names, indicating which dark god their lives were dedicated to at their naming day. Such names preface the name of the cult or god with ai- and sometimes shorten the cult or god's name to two or three syllables. Most continue to serve or at least pray to these gods as adults, with varying degrees of piety.

Example Male Names: Aggorret (eater), Denahrek (servant), Medloss (binder), Mörkothr (darkness), Narkot (gnawer), Pälsore (slaver), Vessar (blooddrinker), Rabefress (slayer).

Example Female Names: Atlessa (jewel), Binulett (scout), Frizel (scribe), Ixa (blade), Miskra (maggot), Respy (builder), Unskappa (wisdom), Unterra (doom).</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

Wyrd gnomes are accomplished arcanists and have a preferred status as servitors to shadow fey, having come with them to the Shadow Realm. Wyrd gnomes possess physical traits typical to the type of gnomes to which they are born, but they are born with two different colored eyes: the right one always blue, the left one always green. Wyrd gnomes possess an innate prescient ability that grows stronger in proximity to other wyrd gnomes. Some gnome communities find their powers a blessing while others find it disturbing. Over generations, wyrd gnomes have gathered together in small communities of their own kind. However, wyrd gnomes don't always birth more wyrd gnomes, and their communities and families have gnomes of other varieties within them.
	Given the collective prescient power of wyrd gnome communities, they can be fascinating places to visit. Travelers may enter an inn to find the food and drink they wished to order already in place on a table. Conversations may start with wyrd gnomes giving answers before the questions are asked.

      <name>Vibrant Expression</name>
      <text>A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.
	A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Delighted Dedication</name>
      <text>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see.
	Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.
	Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they're just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkerers, and inventors. They're willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.</text>

Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.
	Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkerers. Some human families retained gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.</text>
