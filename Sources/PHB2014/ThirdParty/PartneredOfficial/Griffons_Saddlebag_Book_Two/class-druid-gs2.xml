        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of Dragons (HB)</name>
        <text>The Circle of Dragons is an old order of druids steeped in rigid tradition. These honor-bound wardens of nature and draconic heritage are members of a secret society that have influenced governance, war, and culture across the world. High-standing members of this Circle have ties to royal bloodlines that date back generations, a connection that's subtly showcased in royal family crests and insignia.
	Druids from this Circle know that dragons, and draconic magic, are as connected to the world as plants or beasts, and utilize that connection to transform into a unique and powerful draconic form all their own.

        <name>Draconic Lore (Circle of Dragons (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to draconic history or lore, you can add your proficiency bonus to the check. If you are already proficient in the History skill, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check instead.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Dragon Shape (Circle of Dragons (HB))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature as a bonus action to transform into a unique form: your dragon shape. You become a Medium dragon while in this form, standing on all fours, but retain your normal character statistics and senses. Your dragon shape's AC is equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2) and has a walking speed and climbing speed of 30 feet. In addition, when you take this form, you gain temporary hit points equal to your hit point maximum. When you return to your normal form, you lose any remaining temporary hit points.
	You can remain in this form for a number of hours equal to half your druid level, rounded down. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
	When you use your dragon shape, you determine what type of dragon to transform into. The type of dragon determines your scale color and breath weapon's damage type, as shown in the table below, but your appearance is otherwise up to you. Your wings aren't yet fully formed at 2nd level, but grow stronger as you gain levels in this class.
	You can't cast spells while in this form, but gain a different set of actions you can use on each of your turns: 

Bite. When you take the Attack action, you can use your dagger-like teeth to make an unarmed strike. You can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls with your bite. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength or Wisdom modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

Breath Weapon. You can use an action to exhale a plume of powerful energy from inside of you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 2d6 damage of your dragon's damage type on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Once you use this feature, it can't be used again for 1 minute.
	Your breath weapon improves at certain levels. At 6th level, your breath weapon deals 3d6 damage and extends in a 20-foot cone. At 10th level, it deals 4d6 damage and extends in a 25-foot cone, and at 14th level it deals 5d6 damage and extends in a 30-foot cone.

Dragon Shape Type:
Dragon | Damage Type
Black | Acid
Blue | Lightning
Brass | Fire
Bronze | Lightning
Copper | Acid
Gold | Fire
Green | Poison
Red | Fire
Silver | Cold
White | Cold

        <name>Improved Dragon Shape (Circle of Dragons (HB))</name>
        <text>By 6th level, your control over your dragon shape has improved, granting you the following benefits while in that form:

	• Your AC is equal to 14 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2).
	• You gain a new way to attack:

	Claws. Your razor-sharp claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. You can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength, for the attack and damage rolls with your claws. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength or Wisdom modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

	• When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one attack with your bite and one attack with your claws. Your attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

	• You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet.

        <text>Starting at 10th level, you're able to cast certain druid spells while in your dragon shape. To cast a spell while in this form, it must use a druid spell slot level of 3rd or lower, and it can't require any material components. 
	In addition, your scales continue to toughen and your wings have become strong enough to carry you. You gain the following benefits while in your dragon shape:

	• Your AC is equal to 15 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2).

	• You have resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon shape.

	• You have a flying speed of 30 feet.

        <text>At 14th level, you can use your breath weapon even while you're not in your dragon shape. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
	In addition, you gain the following benefits while in your dragon shape:

	• Your AC is equal to 16 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum 2).

	• Your flying speed increases to 40 feet.

	• When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make three attacks: one with your bite, and two with your claws. 

Finally, when you take on your dragon shape, you can choose to become a Large dragon, instead of Medium. If you do, your bite has a reach of 10 feet, instead of 5.
