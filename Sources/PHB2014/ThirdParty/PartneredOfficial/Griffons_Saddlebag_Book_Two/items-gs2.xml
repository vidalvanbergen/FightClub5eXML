    <text>You can clasp or remove this metal bracelet around the wrist or ankle of yourself or a willing creature within your reach using an action. The bangle emits a ward of abjuration magic from it that has a 30 hit points. A creature wearing the bangle can use its reaction when it takes damage to speak the bangle's command word, causing the magical ward to take the damage instead. Any excess damage carries over to the creature when the bangle's ward is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point the bangle becomes a nonmagical bracelet.

	When you drink this wine, you can regain hit points by spending any number of Hit Dice, as if you'd finished a short rest. You regain 1 extra hit point for each Hit Die you spend in this way. The wine provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made in this way, the target also suffers from one of the following effects:

Bludgeoning Gust: If the mote of wind dealt bludgeoning damage, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or pushed 15 feet away from you (your choice). If the target is Huge or larger, it automatically succeeds on the saving throw.

Piercing Wind: If the mote of wind dealt piercing damage, you can immediately make another attack with the same mote of wind against a different creature that is within 15 feet of the original target. This attack deals piercing damage.

Slashing Tornado: If the mote of wind dealt slashing damage, each other creature within 5 feet of the original target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 slashing damage.

	The left side is locked by a metal clasp decorated with a sun. From dawn until dusk, you can open the left side of the box, which contains the same contents and functions identically to a healer's kit. Each day at dusk, the left side of the box magically closes and regains all expended uses of its healer's kit.
	The right side is locked by a metal clasp decorated with a moon smoking a pipe. From dusk until dawn, you can open the right side of the box, which contains three pewter steins, a flask, and a wooden pipe. While holding the flask, you can use an action to speak its command word followed by either "beer", "wine", or "whiskey". When you do, the flask magically fills with up to 4 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or 8 ounces of liquor, depending on the chosen drink, which can be poured out as an action, up to 1 gallon per minute. Once this property of the flask has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk. The wooden pipe is magically refilled with tobacco daily at dusk. Each day at dawn, the right side of the box magically closes, and anything removed from the box is magically returned to it.
	While attuned to the box, you are proficient in the Medicine skill and can open either side of the box at any time. If you're already proficient in the Medicine skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that skill.

    <text>This rounded amulet depicts a harrowing crescent moon with blood-red claw marks running through its center. The markings emit a dim red light on the day of a full moon.
	If you're not a lycanthrope, you can use a bonus action while wearing the amulet to assume a more bestial appearance, taking on the claws and defining features of either a bear, rat, tiger, or wolf (your choice). This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 hit points or use a bonus action to revert to your normal form. For the duration, you can use your claws as natural weapons when making unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell for the duration of the transformation. This property can't be used again for 12 hours or until the next dusk, whichever comes first. Alternatively, if it's within 24 hours of a full moon, this property can be used again after 6 hours, instead of 12.
	If you're already a lycanthrope and are wearing the amulet, your claw and bite attacks while in your animal or hybrid forms deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, your bite attack save DC increases by 3.

Curse: This amulet is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist becoming cursed by lycanthropy.

Alertness: When you roll for initiative, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

Protection: When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.

Vigilance: When one or more creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you are forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend 2 or more charges. For 2 charges, you grant one affected creature of your choice advantage on the saving throw. For each additional charge you expend, you grant one more affected creature of your choice advantage on the saving throw. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which is a monk weapon for you.

Dragon King's Wrath. As a bonus action, you can spend 4 ki points to channel the fury of a powerful dragon and enter a magical rage. While raging in this way, you gain the following benefits:

	• If you aren't wearing armor, dragon-like scales cover your body, granting you a +1 bonus to AC.
	• You can't be charmed or frightened.
	• You can make one attack with this weapon as a bonus action on each of your turns, and when you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make two attacks with this weapon instead of two unarmed strikes.
	• When a creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make an attack with this weapon against that creature immediately after its attack.

This rage lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you are knocked unconscious. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

	While holding the eye, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the identify spell from it.

In addition, if you cast legend lore and use the sphere as the material component for the spell while you're attuned to it, the 10 percent chance that the sphere is consumed by the spell isn't cumulative, and in the event that the sphere is consumed by the spell, it loses this property and can no longer be used as a component for the spell, but isn't destroyed

    <text>This massive wooden shield was made using the bark of an ancient treant. While holding it, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.
	While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as an action to create a wall of up to twelve trees on a solid surface within 120 feet of you. Each tree is 5 feet across at its base, up to 20 feet tall, and must be contiguous with another tree. Alternatively, you can create a ringed wall of trees up to 25 feet in diameter centered on your space. The trees grow tightly next to each other, preventing movement between them and providing total cover to anything behind them. A tree only grows a canopy if there is room for it.
	If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice), or half as much damage on a successful save. The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. Each tree has AC 13, 20 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage. A tree disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the effect ends. While you're within 30 feet of the wall, you can see through a tree's space (no action required) using your senses. When you make a melee weapon attack while within 30 feet of one or more of the trees, you can make the attack as if you were in one of the trees' spaces.
	When you do, the tree magically forms a wooden copy of you and any weapon you're holding to make the attack: duplicating any of its effects. The wall lasts as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute, or until it's dispelled by a dispel magic spell of 6th-level or higher, or until you are no longer holding the shield. Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Flight. While holding the bow, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cause small wings to appear on your feet that last until the end of your turn. For the duration, you have a flying speed of 90 feet. While the wings remain, you can choose to expend another charge from the bow at the end of each of your turns (no action required) to extend the wings' duration until the end of your next turn.

Healing Horn. While holding the bow, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to fire a magical arrow of pure light at a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you, causing that creature to regain 2d6 + 2 hit points.

Trampling Arrow. When you make a ranged attack with the bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the fired arrow to transform into a spectral, charging pegasus. On a hit, the target takes an extra 3d6 force damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target of the attack is already prone, you ignore the normal disadvantage imposed on ranged attack rolls against prone creatures and make the roll with advantage instead.

    <text>This pair of rich silk gloves is guarded by an enchanted mithral shell that sporadically releases arcane power. You can use the gauntlets as a spellcasting focus while wearing them, and when you cast a spell using a spell slot of 5th level or lower, you can choose to roll a d6.
	If you roll a number on the d6 equal to or greater than the spell's slot level, the spell draws on the magic within the gauntlets, instead of your own, and is cast without expending a spell slot. The slot must be of a level you can normally cast. The gauntlets can provide up to 5 levels worth of spell slots in this way each day, and no two slots can be the same level.
	If the number rolled on the d6 is less than the spell slot's level, you cast the spell as normal and expend the spell slot. If you don't have the spell slot to cast the spell, the spell fails and the slot is counted toward the gauntlets' daily provided spell slots.
	For example, a 9th-level wizard can use the gauntlets to provide either one 5th-level spell slot or a 4th- and 1st-level spell slot over the course of a day, but not two 2nd- or 3rd-level spell slots.

Spells. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it: comprehend languages (written language only) or illusory script.

When you do, a magical, spectral door slowly appears in front of you over the course of 1 minute, duplicating the effect of the magnificent mansion spell with the following change. The dwelling always includes a large library that magically includes copies of books, scrolls, maps, and more. The library does not count toward the total amount of space created by the spell.

A creature can visit the library and attempt to uncover a piece of knowledge, such as ancient poetry, the history of a forgotten kingdom, or the family lineage of a tyrannical king. The GM determines the checks and DCs needed to locate a given piece of information. For example, a book of foreign nursery rhymes may be easy to find, but a copy of necromantic research documents would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.
	When the spell ends, the key can't be used this way again for 24 hours.

    <text>This sculpted breastplate has a pair of small mechanical wings attached to its back. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The armor has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to magically unfurl the mechanical wings and fly up to 60 feet in a straight line toward a point of bright light that you can see (such as a torch, light spell, or the sun) without provoking opportunity attacks.
	The wings remain unfurled until you touch the ground, during which time you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round and gain a flying speed of 30 feet, which you can use to glide horizontally as you descend. While gliding in this way, you cannot fly upwards unless you use the armor to fly toward a point of bright light again. When you land on the ground while falling in this way, the mechanical wings refold themselves to your back, and you take no damage from falling.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This magic piece of ammunition weighs 1 pound but otherwise flies exactly like a normal arrow or bolt. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this ammunition, that creature must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is grappled by the arrow for 1 minute as the chain magically extends and wraps around the target. On a success, the creature's speed is halved until the start of your next turn instead. A creature grappled by the arrow in this way can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect and freeing itself on a success.
	After this effect ends, the ammunition clatters to the ground and becomes a 2-foot length of nonmagical chain.

    <text>As an action, you can spread these magic caltrops over a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. When this happens, the caltrops explode in a burst of extraplanar energy, destroying the caltrops and dealing 6d6 force damage to the creature and causing it to rise vertically up to 20 feet, as if by the levitate spell. The creature remains suspended in this way for 1d4 rounds, during which time its speed becomes 0. The effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.
	When the caltrops are spread on the ground, they become nearly invisible and float up to 1 inch off the ground. A creature notices the caltrops with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. You can reclaim the invisible caltrops for later use with 1 minute of careful searching and collecting. The caltrops stop floating and become visible once they're reclaimed in this way

    <text>This brass astrolabe has a glass back that sparkles softly when light shines through it. While looking through the glass at the night sky, the names and patterns of any constellation you can see appear alongside their stars on the astrolabe. At the GM's discretion, you may find one or more of the following constellations while looking through the glass. When you do, the astrolabe begins to glow, and you can use an action to speak the item's command word to gain the constellation's respective benefit:

The Drum. 3 stars appear on your back in the shape of a drum. When you roll for initiative, you can expend 1 of the stars as a reaction to grant you and any other friendly creature within 10 feet of you a +1 bonus to the roll. In addition, any creature that gains this bonus to initiative can use a bonus action on its first turn of combat to take either the Dash or Disengage action.

The Knight. 5 stars appear on your arm in the shape of a sword. When you hit with a melee attack, you can choose to expend 1 of the stars as part of the attack to cause the target to take an extra 1d4 radiant damage. Alternatively, if a friendly creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits a target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the stars and empower the attack with light, causing the target to take an extra 1d4 radiant damage.

The Seer. 4 stars appear on your forehead in the shape of an eye. You can use a bonus action to expend 1 of the stars and touch a creature. Once within the next 10 minutes, that creature can choose to add 1d4 to an ability check or saving throw that it makes. It can choose to roll the die before or after making the ability check or saving throw.

The stars remain until the next dusk, at which point any unused stars vanish and are lost. Once the astrolabe has granted a benefit in this way, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

While a badge is attached to the cover of your spellbook, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell of that badge's school of magic into your spellbook is halved. You can collect multiple of these plates and fit them onto the cover of your spellbook, allowing you to gain this benefit for multiple schools of magic at once. You can use an action to attach or remove a badge from a spellbook by expending a spell slot of a level equal to 1 plus the number of badges already on the book (a maximum of a 9th level spell slot).

While wearing the badge, you can recite its command phrase over the course of 1 minute to cast the plane shift spell using the badge. When cast in this way, the spell's destination can only be the Wayfarer's Respite on the Astral Plane, an inn and pub of legend that drifts throughout the astral sea.
	The inn has no doors leading outside and can only be entered using the badge. Inside, the Wayfarer's Respite is large, comfortable, and decadent. It's frequently busy, despite its exclusivity, but always seems to have enough room and beds available for the wayward band of adventurers. The inn is expensive and suited for an aristocratic lifestyle, but is known to be willing to barter or trade for treasure, information, and favors.
	Any creature that teleports to the inn is magically transported with their belongings back to their original location after 24 hours. You can use the badge to cast the plane shift spell again in this way to return to your original location early. Once you return from the Wayfarer's Respite, the badge can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
	The badge's command phrase and purpose is a closely-kept secret. While casting identify on the badge only reveals the fact that the badge is magical, a legend lore spell reveals the badge's command phrase and properties.

    <detail>common</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This Tiny, sentient pebble is covered in dirt and is likely a remnant of a charmed earth elemental. It rolls about on its own in search of new and unique sources of dirt. When it finds a patch of particularly rich soil, the ball rolls around in it to incorporate the dirt into its form. The ball carries captured moisture inside itself, allowing it to make its form either dusty or clay-like in texture, as well as hard or soft to the touch. A friendly ball of wild earth can magically reshape the dirt it's covered in to form a variety of shapes at will, such as a tiny figurine or a large die, provided that the dirt continues to cover the pebble at its center by doing so.
	The ball of wild earth is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a speed of 10 feet and can only move by rolling across the ground. It has AC 10, 15 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The ball regains all its hit points if it's left buried underground for at least 1 hour.

Sentience. The ball of wild earth is a sentient neutral item with an Intelligence of 2, a Wisdom of 6, and a Charisma of 4. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can't speak or read, but understands Common and Terran.

Personality. The ball of wild earth is most happy when rolling through rich, healthy soil. Most can be found, at least initially, in mountainous farmlands, but even urban ones can enjoy the dust and traces of weird, foreign dirt that are ever-present in well-traveled cities. The quickest way to make a ball of wild earth happy is to give it gemstone dust to roll in, whereas removing the dirt and mud that surround its central pebble is certain to upset it. By reforming the dirt covering its form, the ball can make vague facial expressions based on the emotions its seen other creatures make.

    <text>A ballista prosthesis is a magical weapon composed of numerous complex mechanical pieces that allow it to act as a functional prosthetic arm. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
	This crossbow has an internal magazine that can hold up to 20 bolts. While there are bolts in the magazine, the crossbow does not have the loading property. It takes 1 minute to reload the magazine.
	The prosthesis attaches to your arm at the elbow or the shoulder, and it can't be removed against your will as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your arm for the entire attunement period. While attuned to the prosthesis, you can use an action to remove or reattach it. As a bonus action, you can retract the crossbow's limbs to the side of your hand or extend them from there. While retracted, the crossbow is concealed and functions identically to a normal hand. A creature can use an action to make a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check, identifying its crossbow components and determining that it's a concealed weapon on a success. While extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.

    <text>A bartender's armistice is a magical coaster typically kept by wary tavernkeepers for cases of extreme danger. When found, a bartender's armistice comes in a set of 1d3 + 1 coasters. Each coaster is 4 inches across, and its weight is negligible.
	As an action, you can speak the coaster's command word and throw it at a point on the ground you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, the coaster becomes fixed in place at the point and emits a magical field in a 30-foot-radius, 15-foot-high cylinder that's centered on it. Each creature within the area must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw when the field appears or when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. A creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. On a failed save, a creature is charmed by you while it remains within the field.
	A charmed creature is indifferent about creatures it can see that it's hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell, or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. If you or your companions harm a charmed creature or its friends, the charm ends. When the charm or field ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.
	When a creature makes an attack or casts a harmful spell that either affects a target within the field or enters or leaves the field's area, that creature must first make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attack or spell fails and is expended, and the action is wasted.
	Each creature within the field has advantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check it makes to deescalate a violent situation. In addition, if a creature in the area is unconscious when the field appears, it immediately stabilizes if it has 0 hit points.
	The coaster has AC 15 and 25 hit points. The field remains for 10 minutes or until the coaster drops to 0 hit points, at which point the coaster is destroyed and the field ends. If the field ends after the full duration, there is a 10 percent chance that the coaster remains magical and can be used again. Otherwise, the coaster becomes nonmagical.

When you finish attuning to the cuff, 6 smaller, spherical beads appear and weave themselves into the hair nearby.
	When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to point the hair cuff at a target within range and speak its command word. When you do, the cuff magically retracts any hair pulled through it and fires 1 of the smaller beads through its exposed opening. Make a ranged weapon attack using the magic cuff, which has a normal range of 15 feet and a long range of 30 feet. You are proficient with the attack. When fired, the spherical bead magically grows to become fist-sized, and it deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit. After the attack, the retracted hair magically reappears through the cuff, and the fired bead is lost. 1d6 fired beads magically reappear in your hair daily at dawn. When not in use as a weapon, the item is indistinguishable from a normal hair cuff.

	In addition, while wearing this belt, you can use an action to release a hellish howl. When you do, you exhale a plume of flames from your mouth in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

	This spear contains a fragment of the moonless hunter, an ancient spirit that can be channeled to assume some of its powers. While holding the spear, you can use a bonus action to call forth and assume the spirit of the moonless hunter. While assuming the spirit, your eyes become pure white, and you gain the following benefits:

	• You ignore the effects of exhaustion.
	• You can't sleep or be put to sleep by magical means, and you can't take or benefit from finishing a long rest.
	• You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
	• You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, out to a range of 60 feet.
	• You can use a bonus action to cause the spear to fly back to your empty hand or land at your feet (your choice), provided that the spear is within 60 feet of you.
	• Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

You can assume the spirit in this way for up to 8 hours. The effect ends early if you release the spirit as a bonus action or if you're farther than 60 feet away from the spear for more than 1 minute. The spirit returns to the spear when you are no longer assuming it, at which point you gain 1 level of exhaustion for every 2 hours you assumed the spirit (minimum 1 level). Exhaustion gained in this way can only be reduced by finishing a long rest.

You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. In addition, while you remain cursed, the number of hit points you regain when healed by magical means (other than the sword's effect) is halved.

    <text>This shallow, ceramic drinking bowl is enchanted to repurpose spilled blood into new life. The bowl holds up to 8 ounces of blood. Once filled, the blood begins to slowly swirl on its own. If left to sit for 1 hour without spilling, the blood in the bowl becomes a gruesome tonic that pulses with a faint, internal glow. Drinking the entire bowl of still blood causes one of two effects. Roll a d12. On a 12, you take 12 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you are stable. On a roll of 11 or lower, you instead regain a number of hit points equal 4 + the number rolled. The blood is thick and sweet, but leaves a bitter aftertaste. The blood's magic fades if it's poured from the bowl without being drunk. Once the bowl has been used in this way, it can't be used again until 1d4 days have passed.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <weight>2</weight>
    <text>This gnarled wooden scepter from the Bloodmire is set with a strange, cracked opal at its head and can be used as a spellcasting focus. The rod has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dusk.
	While holding the rod, you can expend 1 of its charges as an action to create a magical tether of light between the rod and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The tether's color and effects depend on what kind of tether you create. You can only have one of each tether at a time.

Empowering Tether. This tether is a brilliant white. A creature affected by this tether regains 2d10 hit points when it's first affected by it, and while it's connected to the tether, it deals an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type to the first target it hits with a melee weapon attack on each of its turns. In addition, on each of your following turns while you maintain the tether, you can expend 1 of the rod's charges as a bonus action to send a surge of healing magic through the tether and cause the target to regain 2d10 hit points.

Withering Tether. This tether is a sickly red. A creature affected by this tether must make a Constitution saving throw when it's first affected by it, using your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 necrotic damage, and on each of your following turns while you maintain the tether, you can use a bonus action to deal 1d10 necrotic damage to the target automatically. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much necrotic damage, and the tether immediately ends.

The tether ends after 1 minute. It ends early if you sever the tether (no action required), are no longer holding the rod, the target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, the target has total cover from you, or if you or the target fall unconscious.

    <name>Bloodmire Soulflame Lantern (HB)</name>
    <detail>legendary (requires attunement)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This iron lantern is surrounded by six glass panels and has a sharp spike in its center where a wick would normally be. When you attune to the lantern, it suddenly springs to life with a crimson flame at the top of the spike, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The flame is magical and can't be extinguished by any means while it burns within the lantern. While the lantern is on your person, you can use a bonus action to mentally expand or reduce the lantern's light, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. As part of this bonus action, you can also cause the lantern's glass panels to magically turn black or clear, allowing you to choose whether the lantern's light is shed in a radius, a cone, or entirely hidden by the darkened glass.
	While the lantern is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

	• You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
	• You have resistance to necrotic damage and are immune to disease.
	• When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to spend one Hit Die to heal yourself. Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). This property can't be used again for 1d12 hours.
	• When a creature within the lantern's light (including you) reduces a living target to 0 hit points, that creature gains 1d8 temporary hit points.
	• You see anything within the lantern's bright light as if you had truesight.
	• Any fiend or undead creature within the lantern's bright light doesn't gain the benefits of any damage resistances it may have, and if it has an ability that would normally take effect when the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't.

Curse. This lantern is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. You remain cursed as long as you remain attuned to the lantern, which can only be ended with a wish spell or by the touch of a powerful fey creature. Even if you die, your attunement to the lantern doesn't end until 7 days have passed.
	As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the lantern, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you must continuously feed the lantern's flame using your own vitality. Whenever you gain or spend any number of Hit Dice, you must also sacrifice one Hit Die to the lantern (if you have any). Alternatively, you can use an action to open the lantern's door and hold your hand over the flame, sacrificing one of your Hit Dice when you do. If the lantern isn't given any Hit Dice for 24 hours, you die, and the flame goes out until the lantern is attuned to by another creature or you return to life while still attuned to it.

    <text>This magic trident has grooves in its obsidian surface that are used to channel blood in rituals of self-sacrifice. While holding the trident, you can use a bonus action to make a blood offering. When you do, choose a number of hit points to sacrifice. You take necrotic damage equal to the amount you sacrifice, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. For every 5 hit points you sacrifice, the trident creates 1 shard of magic obsidian, which floats alongside the trident's three prongs for 1 minute. You can have up to 3 shards in this way at a time. The trident deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage to any target it hits for each floating shard it has.
	When you throw the trident while it has at least 1 floating shard, the weapon flies back to your hand immediately after the attack.

	While you hold this magic sword, you have resistance to necrotic damage. When you take the Attack action while holding this sword, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to sacrifice your own blood. When you do, you take 1d6 + 3 piercing damage from the sacrifice. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. This self-inflicted harm empowers the sword, granting you a cumulative +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon that lasts for 1 minute, up to a maximum bonus of +3. While the sword is empowered in this way, it deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target it hits.

    <text>The typical bloody marilith, a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that fills your body with reactive energy. For 1 minute after drinking this potion, you can use a reaction even if you've already taken one since the end of your last turn. Once you take this reaction, the potion's effect ends. The potion is a deep crimson color with a thick consistency that vibrates softly within its bottle, sending ripples along its surface.
	It smells and tastes of freshly ground pepper, hot spices, and faintly sour tomato juice. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
	Drinking additional bloody mariliths before you finish a long rest leaves your body feeling worn. When the potion's effect ends, you can't move or take actions until after your next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over you.
	The following bloody marilith is a very rare variant with more powerful properties. It uses blood from a fiendish marilith, instead of a magical substitute, and pleasantly burns your tongue when drinking it. It also tastes better.
	When you drink this potion, you can take one reaction on every turn in a combat for 1 minute. Unlike its common variant, this potion's effect does not end when you use an additional reaction.

    <text>This magic book has only the basic outline of a humanoid drawn on each of its pages. When found, the book has 2d6 + 8 remaining pages inside. If you spend at least 10 minutes drawing a detailed set of clothes on the outlined humanoid, the page becomes charged with magic. A creature holding a torn-out sheet of charged paper can use its action to speak the book's command phrase, causing the drawn clothes to either magically appear on its body or transform any similar, overlapping garment it's already wearing to match the new appearance. The sheet of paper then turns to dust and is destroyed. If the creature isn't humanoid, the clothes fit as best they can as determined by the GM.
	A transformed garment loses any magical or nonmagical property it may have until it returns to its normal form, unless that garment's function is completely unchanged by the new appearance. For example, a set of plate armor that's transformed into a leather vest would no longer grant any benefit to AC, but a chain shirt that's been transformed to match the ones worn by the royal guard still would.
	The drawn clothes and transformed garments remain for up to 4 hours but magically disappear or return to their normal form if you remove them or use an action to speak the command phrase again. The drawn clothes are physical but offer no benefits to AC. Although the drawn clothes and transformed garments can duplicate the appearance of other magic clothes, they don't gain their magical properties.

When you throw this item, a playful animal spirit appears beside you and chases after it. Immediately after you throw it, the spirit returns the ball to you.
	You can attach the bounder's ball to the base of a weapon that does not have the heavy property by pressing it against the weapon for at least 10 minutes. Once you do, you can use a bonus action to speak the ball's command word to cause the weapon to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or stowing the weapon puts out the light. When you make a ranged attack with the glowing weapon, the ball's animal spirit appears and happily retrieves it. Immediately after the attack, the spirit returns the weapon to your hand or drops it at your feet (your choice).
	You can remove the ball from the weapon over the course of a short rest by gently tugging at it, as if from an animal's mouth. The spirit is ethereal and doesn't occupy any space. If you have a companion's band[1], the spirit can interact with the one created by the band.

	In addition, you can use an action to speak the bracers' command word. When you do, the bracers' iron and leather twist and writhe, falling off your arms. The bracers become a giant octopus at a point within 10 feet of you under your control that acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the bracers to their normal form in a space formerly occupied by the octopus.
	This octopus is made of leather and iron, is a construct instead of a beast, and has a +2 bonus to its AC. On your turn, you can mentally command the octopus if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the octopus takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.
	If the octopus is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its bracer form. The bracers then shatter and are destroyed. If the octopus reverts to bracer form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.

    <text>This twisting mass of tightly knotted thorns forms a functional buckler. Its thorny limbs move ever so slightly to defend against incoming attacks that might otherwise pierce it. When you don the shield, the vines grow harmlessly around the arm and hand that's holding it, preventing it from being unwillingly dropped or disarmed.
	As an action, you can speak the shield's command word and touch it to the ground at a point at your feet. When you do, you doff the shield as the vines release from your arm and rapidly grow across the ground, creating a visible line of thorns and brambles 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. The thorns recreate the effects of the spike growth spell within that area, without requiring concentration, and last for the spell's duration.
	When it ends, the thorns coalesce back into the twisted shield. You can speak the shield's command word again as an action while you're within 5 feet of the thorny area to end the effect early, causing the vines to regrow onto your arm as you don the shield again. Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>This javelin is protected by a tough carapace wrought from a slain bulette and can burrow through dirt and unworked stone in order to reach its mark. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
	When you make a ranged attack with this javelin, you can throw it into the ground instead. When you do, you can target either a creature you can see or space on the ground within the weapon's range. The space can be a place you can see or one you can describe by stating the distance and direction the javelin would travel through the ground to reach it, such as "100 feet northwest" or "30 feet straight downward." The javelin effortlessly burrows through the ground (if able) to reach the target of the attack, stabbing through the ground at its destination. After the attack, it burrows back to your location, jumping out of the ground and back into your hand. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made in this way, the target of the attack takes an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage and 1d6 slashing damage as the weapon viciously erupts from the ground, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must also succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone. Attacking a prone creature with this weapon doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.

Four of the case's compartments connect to an extradimensional space that allows it to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 7 pounds. You choose which compartment you access by holding one of the large star's five points whenever you open the lid. The smallest compartment can hold up to 7 flutes or similar small instruments. The midsize compartment holds up to 3 large instruments, such as a bagpipe, drum, or dulcimer. The largest compartment holds up to 4 small stools and a music stand. The fourth compartment doesn't have a defined size, but can hold and categorize up to 60 sheets of written music. If you don't choose a compartment, the case automatically opens to the fifth one, which doesn't connect to an extradimensional space. The fifth compartment has enough room to hold a lute inside it.
	Retrieving an item from the case requires an action. If you place something other than an instrument or musical object within one of the case's extradimensional compartments, it magically appears next to the case again when you close the lid.

	When you hit an undead with the glowing flail, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
	When you use your Channel Divinity while holding the glowing flail, hostile creatures in the weapon's bright light take radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier, and friendly creatures in the bright light regain hit points equal to the same amount. This damage is dealt before any other effects from your Channel Divinity. In addition, if your Channel Divinity forces a creature to make a saving throw, any undead in the flail's bright light that fail the saving throw are also blinded until the end of your next turn.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This hand mirror is roughly 1 foot tall and weighs 1 pound. While gazing into its reflective surface, you see a version of yourself that's ever-so-slightly different. For example, your legs may bend the opposite direction, your eyes may be pitch black, or your reflection simply takes a moment to match whatever it is you're doing. If you look at your reflection in the mirror while holding it and aren't attuned to the mirror, you are forced to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you are frightened of the mirror, are unable to look away from or let go of it, and your speed becomes 0 for the duration. You can repeat this saving throw at the start of each of your turns or whenever you take damage while frightened in this way, ending the effect on a success.
	If you can't see the mirror, you have advantage on the saving throw. On a successful save, you are immune to this effect for 24 hours. While attuned to the mirror, you can use an action to hold it out and force another creature within 30 feet of you that can see you to see its own reflection. That creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or suffer from one of the following effects (your choice):

Frighten. The creature is frightened of the mirror for up to 1 minute, is unable to look away from it, and its speed becomes 0 for the duration. The creature can repeat this saving throw at the start of each of its turns while frightened in this way, ending the effect on a success. If it can't see the mirror at the start of its turn, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Store Reflection. The creature's reflection is stored within the mirror. While stored, you can use an action to look into the mirror and cause your own reflection to become the stored one, simultaneously changing the appearance of your physical form as if you had cast the alter self spell (Change Appearance option). This version of the spell lasts until it's dispelled. You can have up to 3 stored reflections in this way. A stored reflection is lost after it's used to alter your form. An affected creature is aware that its reflection has been stored, but not its or the mirror's purpose.

These properties can be used a combined total of three times and regain all expended uses daily at dawn. Using a stored reflection to alter your appearance doesn't count against the mirror's total number of uses.

    <text>An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.
	This rod weighs 3 pounds and has an iron brazier at its top and spike at its base. You can use a bonus action while holding the rod to speak its first command word and create a magical flame at its top. While lit, this rod functions as a burning torch. You can use a bonus action to speak its command word again to extinguish the flame.
	You can use an action to place the rod's brazier upside down on the ground in an unoccupied space and speak its second command word. When you do, the spike at the rod's other end begins to glow from within, revealing its subtle design as a tent. Over the course of 1 minute, the rod expands and magically unfurls a canvas from its top, creating a 5-foot-square opaque tent in its space with an entrance large enough for a Medium or smaller creature to comfortably fit. You choose the style, color, and quality of the tent each time you use this property.
	Regardless of its appearance, the tent can't be anything but a tent. Inside the tent is a square extradimensional dwelling, 15 feet on a side and 10 feet high, with the enlarged camper's respite supporting it at its center. The walls and ceiling are made of the same canvas as the tent, but the floor is made of smooth stone. The rod's enlarged brazier functions as a magical fireplace that can be lit or extinguished by speaking the rod's first command word. This fire gives off light and heat like a normal fire, but doesn't require oxygen or create smoke. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.
	The tent is immobile and remains for up to 12 hours, until you use an action to speak its second command word again to dismiss it, or until the tent collapses. Dealing 20 damage to the tent (AC 13) causes it to collapse. The tent is immune to poison and psychic damage. The tent reverts to a rod at the end of its duration, and anything inside the tent is forced into the nearest unoccupied space. When the tent becomes a rod again, this property of the rod can't be used again for 12 hours.

When you move while wearing this cloak, small, tattered feathers drift from the cloak that vanish when they touch the ground. While wearing the cloak, your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, you have advantage on saving throws against disease and poison, and you have resistance to poison damage.
	In addition, while wearing the cloak, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to transform into a pair of sickly vulture wings for 1 minute. While the cloak is transformed, you gain a flying speed of 60 feet, and when you hit a creature that's missing any of its hit points with a melee weapon attack, that creature takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage. This property of the cloak can't be used again until the next dusk.

Curse. This cloak is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it worn at all times. The cloak gives you an insatiable hunger for flesh, and while traditional food can sustain you, you no longer enjoy the smell or taste of it. While cursed, whenever you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you're forced to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature is a construct, ooze, plant, or undead, you automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a failed save, you are overcome with the urge to tear into the creature's flesh and feast: sacrificing any additional movement, action, or bonus action you had left on your turn. You can repeat this saving throw at the start of each of your following turns, ending your need to feast on a success.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These leather gloves are fashioned from the hands of a slain chain devil. While wearing these gloves, an ethereal chain attaches itself to any weapon you throw that has the thrown property. The chain has a reach of 60 feet and breaks its connection to the weapon if the weapon is held by a creature or if you are ever more than 60 feet away from it. You can have up to 4 of these chains at any time.
	As an action, you can cause these chains to suddenly retract and pull any attached weapons with them.
	Any creature within the path of one or more of these weapons must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to the damage die of the thrown weapon. A solid object or wall blocks the path of the retracted chain and weapon. A retracted weapon lands harmlessly at your feet or in an open hand once it reaches you.

You must have a Strength score of 13 or higher to wield this bow. This bow's damage die is a d10, and when you make a ranged attack with this bow, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
	Once on each of your turns when you make a ranged attack with this weapon, you can use the bow to fire a javelin or spear, instead of an arrow, without affecting the bow's damage die. When you do, the bow's normal and long ranges are halved for the attack. If the attack hits, the target takes extra piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 1d4 lightning damage to any target it hits.

Electric Charge. If you are proficient with this weapon, when you move at least 20 feet in a straight line on your turn while holding this rapier, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to briefly disappear and transform into a bolt of lightning. When you do, choose an unoccupied space you can see within 20 feet of you that's along the same straight line and in the same direction in which you're moving. You form a 5-foot-wide line of lightning originating from yourself that extends to the unoccupied space. You reappear in that space as the bolt of lightning passes through anything in its path.

If there are any creatures in the line of lightning, roll a d20 and add 9 to the roll. If the total of the roll meets or exceeds the AC of any creature in the line, that creature takes 1d4 + 1 lightning damage as you pierce through it as the bolt of lightning.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This magic collar has three sections of sculpted metal bound by a strip of leather, with each section representing the head of a dragon, lion, and ram. You can place the collar on a willing Medium or smaller creature using an action. If the creature is a friendly beast companion or familiar (such as one summoned by the find familiar spell), you can speak the collar's command word as part of this action to create a magical bond between you and the creature. The bond remains until the collar is removed.
	You can use a bonus action to speak the collar's command word while you can see the bonded creature within 30 feet of you. When you do, the creature grows in size to become Large, provided there's enough space. When it becomes enlarged, the creature gains 2d10 + 4 temporary hit points, can understand Draconic (but can't speak it), and magically grows a second, identical head next to its own that lasts for the duration of the effect. Whenever the enlarged creature takes the Attack action, it can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action instead if it has that action. The creature remains enlarged for up to 1 minute, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you end the effect using a bonus action. Once this property of the collar has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
	If the beast or familiar wearing the collar is a transformed humanoid or other creature, such as by the polymorph spell or similar magic, the bond fails when you speak the command word and the collar has no effect. If the bonded creature is a familiar summoned by the find familiar spell, the collar and familiar disappear into a pocket dimension together whenever you temporarily dismiss it. If the bonded familiar is dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the collar behind. A creature can only gain the benefits of one magical collar at a time.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic weapon, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

Roll the damage dice separately, recording any 6 you roll.
	For each 6 you roll in this way, use the table below to determine which of the following effects apply.

Chromatic Obsidian Greataxe:
Damage Type | Effect
Cold | The target's speed is halved until the end of your next turn.
Fire | The target takes an extra 6 fire damage at the end of its next turn.
Lightning | The target can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.
Radiant | The next attack roll made against the target before the end of your next turn has advantage.

While holding the sphere, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing spectral clock hands to appear on its curved surface and indicate the current time. The hands remain on the surface of the sphere until you speak the command word again. This property only functions on the Material Plane.

Spells. While holding the sphere, you can use an action to cast either the haste or slow spell (save DC 18, no concentration required) from it. Once the sphere has been used to cast a spell in this way, it can't be used to cast that spell again. When the sphere has been used to cast both of these spells, it loses this property.

	While wearing the eyepiece, you can expend 1 charge as a reaction at the end of another creature's turn to speak either of the eyepiece's two command words to warp the flow of time around that creature. You must be able to see the target, and it must be within 60 feet of you.
	Past. If the target is willing, it is teleported back to the space it was at the beginning of its turn. If another creature or object is occupying the space, the target is teleported to the nearest unoccupied space instead. An unwilling target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be teleported in this way against its will.
	Future. If the target is willing, it can immediately choose to move again, up to half its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. After a target moves in this way, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

    <text>This iron circlet has a magical pearl at its center and can hold up to 4 gemstones. When found, the circlet has 2 gemstones. A gemstone worth at least 5,000 gp can be added to the circlet over the course of 1 minute as it's magically drawn and fastened into place. While wearing the circlet, you can take a special Attack action on your turn to summon a number of floating, spectral swords equal to the number of gemstones in the circlet and make one melee spell attack with each of them against a target within 10 feet of you. You are proficient with these attacks and use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for them. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier. The swords appear at your side and remain there until you dismiss them as a bonus action or until you fall unconscious or remove the circlet. While the swords are summoned, you can take this special Attack action once on each of your turns. The spectral swords shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
	You can replace one of these melee spell attacks with a weapon attack as part of this special Attack action. If you're able to make multiple attacks when you take the Attack action, you can instead replace a number of these spell attacks up to the number of weapon attacks that you can normally make as part of the Attack action. When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to make one melee spell attack with one of the summoned swords against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This Tiny, sentient piece of an enchanted gelatinous cube is harmlessly soapy, instead of acidic, and enjoys cleaning the surfaces it travels across. When found, the cleaning cube is a dehydrated, 2-inch cube. While dehydrated, the cube is inanimate and its weight is negligible. You can place the dehydrated cube in 1 or more gallons of water as an action, causing it to animate and grow in size to become a 1-foot cube that weighs 6 pounds. The rehydrated cube moves slowly while animated in this way, methodically cleaning objects and surfaces it comes into contact with. The cube remains hydrated for up to 8 hours, but can be squeezed as an action (as if it were a sponge) to dehydrate it again early.
	The cleaning cube is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a speed of 1 foot and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. The cube dehydrates when it drops to 0 hit points, but regains all its hit points when hydrated again.

Sentience. The cleaning cube is a sentient unaligned item with an Intelligence of 1, a Wisdom of 6, and a Charisma of 1. It has hearing and blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. It can't speak or read, but obeys your commands as best as it can understand them.

Personality. The cleaning cube is happiest finding and dissolving dirt and other grime, and enjoys the feeling of moving across clean, polished surfaces. It doesn't concern itself with combat, preferring to continue its cleaning instead of involving itself in confrontation. If the cube finds a stray coin, gemstone, or other similar small item out of place while it cleans, it will absorb and clean the item until it's removed by a creature as an action or until it becomes dehydrated once again.

1 | A delicious meal appears on the platter large enough for one creature and provides as much nourishment as 1 day of rations.

6 – 12 |  The cloche magically conjures a great feast, as if by the heroes' feast spell. This version of the spell can feed a number of creatures equal to the number rolled on the d12

Once the cloche has been used to conjure a meal in this way, it can't be used again until a number of days have passed equal to the number rolled on the d12

	Similarly, any small machine (such as a compass or hunting trap) left inside the closed toolbox for 1 hour is magically repaired. Any magical item with "clockwork" in its name regains all its hit points when left in the toolbox in this way. If the magical item has charges or additional magical properties, it regains 1d4 expended charges and the ability to use those properties again.

	• You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks you make that rely on hearing.
	• You can tap the earwig twice to record up to 1 minute of sound, tapping it twice again to stop recording early. You can tap the earwig once to replay the recording in your ear, tapping it a second time to stop it early. Pressing and holding your finger to the earwig while it's replaying the recording will pause the recording until you release your finger from it. Creating a new recording in this way erases any previous one stored.
	• You can speak the earwig's command word as an action to cast the comprehend languages spell from it. The spell ends early if you remove the earwig. This property of the earwig can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>This segmented mechanical caterpillar is 5 inches long, weighs 1 pound, and is made of copper. It has several tiny copper legs that give it a 5-foot walking speed. Within it are multiple containers filled with silk filaments, spools of thread, dyes, and an incredibly strong adhesive. Each of these materials is expelled through a tube in its mouth, and it is equipped with a transmutation lens in its head that allows it to change the adhesive to various kinds of wood, metal, stone, or crystal.
	As an action, you can speak the caterpillar's command phrase to cause it to repair a broken or torn object or area that it's set upon. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot across in more than 1 dimension, the caterpillar can create the material to repair it. The caterpillar then begins crawling over and repairing the object or area, taking 10 minutes for every cubic foot it repairs (minimum of 1 minute). The caterpillar can physically repair a magic item or construct, but can't restore magic to such an object. After the caterpillar finishes repairing an object or area, it stops moving and makes a soft chirping sound audible out to 30 feet. Once the caterpillar repairs 10 cubic feet of material, it can't be used again until 24 hours have passed.
	The caterpillar is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has AC 10, 15 hit points, and has resistance to all damage types. If the mending spell is cast on the caterpillar while it has at least 1 hit point, it regains 2d6 hit points. If the caterpillar drops to 0 hit points, it can't be used again for 24 hours, at which point it regains all its hit points.

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to move up to 30 feet in a line to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground, barreling through creatures no more than one size larger than you and objects that weigh no more than 400 pounds in the line. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks and ignores difficult terrain. Each target in the line you barrel through must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 3d4 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. If a target in the line is a structure or is too large or heavy to barrel through, it automatically succeeds on the saving throw and your movement ends early. Your movement also ends early if you attempt to move over a space in which you normally can't, such as over a gorge or up a wall.

A coldfire weapon is magical and deals an extra 1d6 cold damage to any target it hits, but is made fragile like ice.
	When you make an attack roll using a coldfire weapon and roll a 1, roll a d20. On a 9 or lower, the weapon shatters and is destroyed, releasing a biting burst of icy air that deals 2d6 cold damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the weapon. After 7 days, a coldfire weapon loses the enchantment and becomes nonmagical again. Once the anvil has been used to enchant a weapon in this way, it can't do so again for 1d6 + 1 days

Ranged attacks with this weapon deal bludgeoning damage, instead of piercing damage, and any target hit by it takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. In addition, the first time you hit a target on each of your turns with a ranged attack using this weapon, each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage.

At the start of your next turn, the ravens vanish, and you reappear in the space of one of the ravens (your choice).
	If all the ravens are reduced to 0 hit points, you reappear early in the same space as the last one that died. When you do, any excess damage dealt to the raven carries over to your normal form.

    <text>Each of this leather ring's three braided bands bears the design of a dark, winding serpent. You can use an action to submerge the ring in a potion of healing or similar healing draft. If the ring is left to sit in a potion for 1 minute in this way, the ring magically consumes it and any of its healing properties. For each potion the ring has consumed, one of its dark serpents glows with a faint red light. The ring can have up to 3 consumed potions at a time.
	Immediately after you take damage while wearing the ring, you can use your reaction to speak its command word and gain the healing effects of one of the ring's consumed potions (your choice). The consumed potion is then lost, and one of the ring's serpents becomes dark once more.

    <name>Cottage Chest (HB)</name>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This 1-foot-long chest looks like a replica of a woodland cottage and is magically locked. You can use an action to place this chest on the ground and speak its command word. The chest immediately unlocks and grows into a cottage that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the cottage is empty. When dismissed, the cottage returns to its normal chest form. If there isn't enough space for the cottage or there are creatures in its area when you speak the command word, the chest remains locked and the action is wasted.
	The cottage is a wooden, two-story building that's 40 feet wide and 65 feet long. Inside is a kitchen, a dining room, and a large parlor with an ever-burning fire in its hearth. A curling stairway leads to the second floor, which has 4 bedrooms equipped with furniture you'd find in a modest to respectable inn. The first floor has six windows, and each bedroom on the second floor has one. When activated, the cottage has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.
	The cottage's kitchen is filled with magical utensils that automatically stir, measure, and heat all manner of cuisine. Any check made using cook's utensils within the cottage has advantage on the roll. When left to its own devices, the cottage magically produces an array of baked goods for up to 8 creatures when the cottage appears for the first time each day and again each day at dawn until it is dismissed. Eating the food within the cottage provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. If any baked goods are left uneaten, they vanish at dawn as the new goods appear. Any baked good, furniture, or similar object vanishes when taken outside the cottage and immediately reappears inside. Further, fey and fiends can't enter the cottage unless you choose to let them, and creatures can't move or travel into it using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.
	The cottage is made of wood and plaster, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over or moved. The roof, the door, and the walls (including the windows) each have 60 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the cottage (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain all its hit points.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This crown was created by storm giants as a reward for a brave band of much smaller adventurers. While wearing this crown, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage. If you are subjected to an effect that deals lightning or thunder damage and allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no lightning or thunder damage if you succeed on the saving throw. If you are a giant, you can choose to wear this crown as a ring, instead.
	In addition, you can use a bonus action to take on the aspect of the stormbringer. When you do, you spark with electrical power and your eyes glow bright white. The aspect lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early using a bonus action. While the aspect persists, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. For the duration, you also gain the following benefits:

	• You can use an action to release a bolt of lightning at a point on the ground that you can see that's within 60 feet of you and at least 15 feet below you. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	• You can use an action to cast the thunderwave spell (2nd-level version, save DC 17). The first time you cast this spell each time you take on the aspect, it's cast at 4th level instead.

	• When an attacker within 30 feet hits you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to send out a bolt of lightning at the attacker. The attacker must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each time the attacker hits you again before the end of this turn, it must repeat the saving throw.

While wearing this crown, you can use an action to cast the telepathic bond spell from it.
	In addition, while wearing the crown, you can use an action to cast the dominate person spell using your spell save DC from it. On a failed save, a creature is affected by the spell for the duration, and for the next 24 hours after the spell ends, you have advantage on Charisma checks you make to interact with it.

    <text>This hefty, metal cube is about 6 inches on a side and weighs 3 pounds. One of the cube's sides looks like a metallic stamp, and is made of countless interlocking and shifting panels that reconfigure themselves to magically generate a new, unique sigil sequence daily at dawn, as described in the teleportation circle spell. Its five other sides are flat and blank, or, at the GM's discretion, have up to 5 different sigil sequences recorded onto them.
	If you find a permanent teleportation circle, you can place and hold one of the cube's flat sides against the circle for 1 hour, focusing on it for the duration (as if concentrating on a spell). If you hold and focus on the cube for the full duration, the circle's sigil sequence is recorded onto the cube's face. If a sigil was already on the cube's face, it's replaced by the new one.
	The cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you hold one of the cube's recorded sigil sequences on the ground face-down and focus on it for 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell), the cube expends 1 of its charges and duplicates the effect of the teleportation circle spell, using the sigil sequence from the cube's face to form the spell's teleportation circle on the ground below it.
	Alternatively, you can hold the stamp side of the cube on the ground and focus on it for 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell). If you hold and focus on the cube for the full duration, it magically applies its unique sigil sequence onto the ground in a 10-foot-diameter teleportation circle, provided that there's enough space to do so. This circle remains for 1 hour, and can only be used as a destination circle for the duration. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn, unless you use an action to expend 1 of the cube's charges to generate a new sigil sequence and regain the use of this property. Once you've placed a unique teleportation circle in this way, you can use this side of the cube as if it were a normal sigil sequence recording for the generated circle.

This aura extends from you in a 15-foot radius, moves with you, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or begin to suffocate. At the end of each of its turns, a creature suffocating in this way can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save or when it drops to 0 hit points, the creature can breathe again. A suffocating creature can't speak. A creature is immune to this effect if it doesn't need to breathe or has legendary actions.
	Release the Kraken. You can use an action to speak the trident's command word to open a 15-foot-radius eldritch gate centered on a point you can see on the ground within 60 feet of you, turning the ground in the area into difficult terrain. If you are underwater, the point doesn't need to be on the ground. The gate is one-way. When the gate opens, up to 3 massive kraken tentacles appear through the gate, forcing any Large or smaller creature in the tentacle's space into the nearest unoccupied space. Each tentacle is treated as a Large monstrosity with 60 hit points, AC 18, a reach of 30 feet, immunity to all conditions, and a +7 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws. A tentacle can move anywhere within the gate's area on your turn (no action required) without provoking opportunity attacks. You can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack with the tentacle. A tentacle remains until it falls to 0 hit points or the gate closes.

Shadow Form. When you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing this amulet, a shadowy version of yourself rises from your unconscious body. You control this form, which has your equipment and statistics. It has 100 temporary hit points and resistance to all damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant. The shadow form can't move more than 60 feet from your body.
	The shadow vanishes after 1 minute or when it loses all its temporary hit points. If the shadow survives for the duration, it returns to your body and causes you to regain a number of hit points equal to the shadow's remaining number of temporary hit points. If the shadow is defeated, the amulet is destroyed and you immediately fail 2 death saving throws.
	While your shadow form is defending you, your unconscious body is covered by an impenetrable veil of shadow. While covered in this way, you can't be interacted with: you are immune to all damage, don't make death saving throws, can't regain hit points, and can't be affected by spells or magical effects. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the covered body up to 10 feet on a success. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

When you cast speak with dead in this way, you can only ask the target 1 question, to which the target answers with either "yes," "no," or "maybe." If the question can't be answered in this way, the spell ends. In ddition, while you wear this crown, undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

Curse. This crown is cursed, a fact that is only revealed to you when you die. The first time that you die while attuned to this crown, its curse is extended to you, and you are immediately returned to life with 1 hit oint. While cursed, your alignment becomes evil, if it isn't already, and your utmost goal is to become an all-powerful lich. While cursed, your creature type becomes undead, in addition to your other existing creature types. A creature remains cursed in this way until targeted by a wish spell or divine intervention. Removing the crown fails to end the curse. While a cursed creature may not reveal that the diadem is cursed, its allies may be able to deduce its presence and effects based on the creature's behavior.

    <text>A rigid stone wand used by the arcane dwarves of the Direstone mines. The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to trace one of the following runes in the air to invoke its properties (spell save DC 15):

Algiz. You can expend 3 charges to grant 1 creature you can see within 10 feet of you resistance to fire damage for 1 hour.

Eihwaz. You can expend 2 charges to cast the arcane lock spell. When you use this spell to lock a second object, the spell ends on the first one.

Hagalaz. You can expend 2 charges to cast the shatter spell. Kenaz. You can expend 1 charge to cast the burning hands spell, or 2 charges to cast the heat metal spell.

Raidho. You can expend 4 charges to cast the stone shape spell. This version of the spell can alter the form of either stone or natural metal (such as iron or silver).

Alternatively, you can use the wand to cast the illusory script spell over the course of 1 minute by expending 1 of its charges, but can only use it to write on stone or metal surfaces.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into stone dust. If you are not a dwarf when this happens, you must also succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

	Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.

	Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
	The following djinn and tonic is a rare variant with additional properties. It also tastes better. When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 10 minutes (no concentration required) or until you end it early using an action. When the effect ends, your form rematerializes in a rush of air, forcing all Large and smaller creatures within 30 feet of you to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This dark, velvety lotus has tiny pinpricks of starlight in its petals and releases lofting, magical pollen. Once picked, a doom bloom withers and is destroyed after 1d6 + 1 days. As an action, you can inhale the magical pollen from a picked flower and speak the name of a creature or location that's on the same plane of existence as you, duplicating the effect of the scrying spell (save DC 15).
	If the target of the effect fails the saving throw, the spell succeeds and the flower explodes into a burst of pollen and is destroyed. If the target succeeds on the saving throw, you instead witness hundreds of brief, painful visions until the start of your next turn that show you untold ways that you might die. When the visions end, you take 6d6 psychic damage, but the flower isn't destroyed. Once this property of the flower has been used, it can't be used again for 24 hours.
	Doom blooms typically grow on their own, but can sometimes be found near others. When the flower dies or is destroyed, a new one grows after 1d6 + 1 days in the same place in which it last grew. If the flower was successfully used to duplicate the effect of the scrying spell, the new flower grows at the location where the spell's sensor first appeared instead. If the sensor followed a creature, there is a 10 percent chance that an additional flower will grow after 1d6 + 1 days at the sensor's location at the end of each minute of the spell's duration.

Each creature within 20 feet of the band other than you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the damage you deal with this weapon would reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose to magically cause it to fall asleep, instead of dealing the damage. The sleeping creature is unconscious for 10 minutes or until it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. When you cause a creature to fall asleep in this way, you can also force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you immediately learn its surface thoughts and can decide what dreams it has while asleep. Once a creature falls asleep in this way, it is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

	In addition, while wearing the hat, you can use an action to speak its command word and throw it on the ground within 10 feet of you. The hat becomes a giant scorpion under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the hat to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the scorpion.
	On your turn, you can mentally command the scorpion if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the scorpion takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.
	The hat remains in scorpion form for up to 8 hours. If the scorpion is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its hat form. Once this property of the hat has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

	You can use an action to swing the axe at an area of magical darkness within 5 feet of you, making an attack roll against the darkness (AC 10). If the magical darkness was created by a spell, add the spell's level to its AC. If you're inside the area of magical darkness, you ignore the disadvantage normally imposed on this attack roll as a result of not being able to see. On a hit, the darkness is dispelled. If the darkness fills a space that's larger than 60 feet on a side, the darkness in a 60-foot cube originating from you is dispelled instead. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>This large, silver tank is nearly 3 feet tall and produces its own magical ale. It has several knobs alongside it and a tapered hose attached to the bottom. The tank holds 8 gallons of ale and completely refills daily at dawn. When you attune to the tank for the first time, it immediately fills with the magical ale. The tank is supported with several leather straps, allowing it to be easily carried. Regardless of how much ale is inside the tank, it always weighs 10 pounds.
	You can dispense the magical ale as you would a normal keg, with the exception that this alcohol affects a creature twice as much as normal due to its magical nature. Alternatively, you can spend 10 minutes focusing on the tank and adjusting its various knobs to produce up to 4 special elixirs, expending 1 gallon of ale for each elixir you make. If you are a dwarf or are proficient with brewer's supplies, you can produce this elixir over the course of 1 minute instead. Each elixir contains one ounce of concentrated liquid. A creature can drink the elixir using an action, granting it advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage for 8 hours. If the creature is a dwarf, it gains 10 temporary hit points instead. If an elixir isn't consumed before the next dawn, it becomes a nonmagical, albeit strongly alcoholic, beverage.
	While carrying the tank, you can use an action to point its hose at a target you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you have a free hand. When you do, the tank expels 1 gallon of the ale in a powerful blast at the target. If the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried and weighs no more than 300 pounds, it is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you. If the target is a creature, make a ranged spell attack against it, using an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, is pushed 5 feet away from you, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of your next turn.

The platform can hover up to 60 feet in the air in this way, and can't be moved horizontally except by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if you were climbing.
	When the platform's property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, its magic ceases to function until the next dawn. When its magic ends in this way, the platform floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

    <text>This hardy, natural mail is made with leather and protected with the large outer shell of an elder sequoia seed cone. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. In addition, while wearing this armor, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a mighty evergreen tree. The tree is 5 feet across at its base and can be up to 40 feet tall. Its branches extend up to 10 feet away from its trunk and must be at least 5 feet above its base.
	The tree has hit points equal to 5 times your druid level, AC 20, and vulnerability to fire damage. While you're a tree, you magically retain your normal senses and gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet, but your speed becomes 0, and you can only use your actions to shuffle your limbs (as if by a breeze or rustling creature), revert to your normal form, or use your Wild Shape again.
	This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
	The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

    <dmgType>P</dmgType>
    <range>20/60</range>
    <text>This two-pronged weapon has a sickly connection to another plane of existence. While holding the bident, you can use an action to release 2 simultaneous beams of eldritch force from it, with each beam originating from one of the weapon's prongs. Make a ranged spell attack for each beam, using a spell attack bonus of +7, against either one or two targets that you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, a target takes 1d8 force damage.
	If you're a warlock, you are proficient with this weapon while you're attuned to it and gain the following benefits:

	• When you make an attack with the bident's eldritch beams, you can choose to use your warlock spell attack bonus instead of the weapon's normal one.

	• When you hit a target with one of the eldritch beams, you add your Charisma modifier to the damage dealt by each beam, which deal 1d12 force damage instead of 1d8.

	• When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with one of the eldritch beams against a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be shunted to another plane of existence occupied by eldritch horrors. While there, the target is incapacitated. At the start of your next turn, the creature takes 2d12 psychic damage and reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Additionally, if you're a warlock, you can use an action to cast the plane shift spell from the bident while holding it to transport yourself only to the plane of existence and location of your warlock patron. You remain there for up to 24 hours or until you use an action to return to your previous location on your original plane of existence. Once this property of the bident has been used, it can't be used again for one year.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

	In addition, you can use an action to touch a Medium or smaller willing creature with the staff to cast the enlarge/reduce spell from it without requiring concentration, targeting the creature with the spell's Enlarge option. While a creature is enlarged in this way, it deals double damage to objects and structures and gains 1d6 + 4 temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns, in addition to the spell's normal effects. The effect ends early if the enlarged creature falls to 0 hit points. When the effect ends, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

This fire damage ignores resistance and immunity. A wooden creature, object, or structure hit by this weapon takes the maximum amount of damage from the attack.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

To attune to this item, you must attach it to the end of your missing arm or leg, at which point the ice magically attaches to you and forms an icy copy of the appendage it's replacing. The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body and can't be removed against your will as long as you're attuned to it.
	While the prosthetic is attached, you have resistance to cold damage, and your unarmed strikes with the limb deal cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage. In addition, the prosthesis has 6 icy spikes protruding from its surface. You can use an action while the prosthetic is attached to launch up to 3 of the spikes at one or more targets within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for each spike, using an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 cold damage. 1d4 + 2 launched spikes regrow daily at dawn.

	A creature can use its action to uncork and apply 1 dose of the eyedrops to itself or another willing creature that it can see within reach, stoppering the eyedropper again once finished. A blinded creature that has eyes and receives a dose of the eyedrops ceases to be blinded. In addition, that creature gains darkvision out to a range of 30 feet and has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight for 1 hour. If the creature already has darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet for the duration.

    <text>These button-sized metal trinkets typically come in sets of two and resemble the fearsome visage of a one-eyed monster. As an action, you can place one firmly on a solid surface—such as a wall, table, or boot—where it remains until destroyed. While you're within 5 feet of one, you can use a bonus action to speak the command word to cause its eye to open. The opening is about the size of a keyhole, and by peering through it, you can open and see through another eye's opening of your choice. You choose which eye to look through the first time you peer into the hole and can change it again using a bonus action.
	The eyes you can choose to see through in this way must be a part of the set, be placed on a solid surface, and be on the same plane of existence as the one you're looking through. You can only see through one eye at a time, which operates both ways, and nothing can pass through the hole. If another eye attempts to look through one you're already using, the connection between the first two ends and is replaced by the new one. An eye closes when it's no longer being looked through.
	Each eye has AC 10 and 5 hit points. If it drops to 0 hit points, the eye is destroyed. If a target or area is immune to divination magic or can't be perceived through scrying sensors, it doesn't appear through the hole. If you find another eye of the beheld, you can connect it to an existing set by holding it against another eye from the set for 1 minute

    <text>This magic torch was harvested from a tree in the Safire Wood, one of the most beautiful and deadly fey forests.
	While holding the torch, you can use a bonus action to speak its first command word, causing eerie blue flames to appear above the head of the torch. The flames shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The flames are not extinguished when immersed in water and last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you stow the torch.
	You can use an action while holding the lit torch to speak its second or third command word. Speaking the second command word causes any illusion within the torch's bright light to be outlined in blue, green, or violet (your choice) for 1 minute. The torch can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
	Speaking the third command word causes the flame to fly from the torch and erupt at a point you can see within 60 feet of you, creating an explosion of blue flames and duplicating the effect of the faerie fire spell (save DC 15, no concentration required) in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. A creature also takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can choose to end the effect early as a bonus action. When the effect ends, the flame reappears above the torch. The torch can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

    <text>The grayed unicorn horn that rests at the top of this sickly spear is fractured and slowly leaks a silver, corrupting fluid. A failed purity spear is the rare version of a purity spear, a legendary weapon, that was made by a creature other than an elder fey. Its magic is a sad reminder that while unicorns are paragons of good, even their magic can become toxic when mistreated.

Corruption. This magic spear has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. You can expend 1 charge when you hit a creature with the spear to cause it to inject the target with its corrupting fluid. When you do, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 point of corruption, which last for 1 minute. A creature takes 1d4 poison damage at the start of each of its turns for each point of corruption it has, up to a maximum of 3d4 poison damage. This poison damage ignores resistance and immunity. A creature with at least 1 point of corruption can make another DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it removes 1 point of corruption. A creature is poisoned while it has 3 or more points of corruption.
	If you expend the spear's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the tip of the spear shatters, and the spear becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.

Charge. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with the spear on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage.

Curse. This spear is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the spear, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. While you're cursed, you have disadvantage on any saving throw against poison. However, while you are poisoned, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This Large, dark iron chariot weighs 300 pounds and can fit up to four Medium or smaller creatures. While you're in the chariot, you have resistance to fire damage.
	Two sets of floating, flaming reins appear when you stand in the chariot, which are harmless to you. As an action, you can crack the reins downward to summon two armored nightmares that are hitched to the front of the chariot. The nightmares have a +1 bonus to AC and exist until they drop to 0 hit points. You can use an action to dismiss them, which works only if you are standing on the chariot. The nightmares are friendly to you, fight only to protect themselves, and can't be unhitched from the chariot. The nightmares' hitches prevent them from being ridden.
	The nightmares regain all lost hit points when they are dismissed for 24 hours. When a nightmare drops to 0 hit points, it can't be summoned again until 1d4 + 1 days have passed. If the second nightmare drops to 0 hit points while the first one can't be summoned in this way, the second nightmare reappears at the same time as the first.
	The chariot is drawn where the nightmares pull it, which you control by holding the reins. If you have a good alignment, there is a 20 percent chance each turn you move the chariot that the nightmares ignore your command and stop in their tracks. While both nightmares are pulling the chariot, it shares their average movement speeds and stays upright when flying. While only one nightmare is pulling the chariot, the nightmare's speed is halved, and it has a flying speed of 0.
	While both nightmares exist, you can use an action while holding the reins to cause the nightmares, the chariot, and any creatures or objects inside it to magically enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.

Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. The spectral tree vanishes immediately after the effect. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the axe can still be used as a magic weapon.
	In addition, you have advantage on any ability check you make to cut down a tree when you're using the axe to chop it down.

    <text>This tiny seed has a glowing rune on its shell. While holding the seed against a weapon or similar held object, you can speak its first command word as an action to cause the seed to sprout and cover the object with green and purple vines. The vines form a comfortable grip with which to hold the object and also create a protective cover for it, such as a sheath or carrying case, that automatically stows the object while it isn't being held, unless you decide for it not to. You can use an action to speak the first command word again to cause the vines to retreat from the object and return to the seed.
	While an object is covered by the vines, you can't be disarmed of that object unless you are incapacitated. In addition, the object can be used as a spellcasting focus for you.
	While the vine-covered object is on your person, you can use a bonus action to speak the vines' second command word to cause them to lash out at a Medium or smaller target that you can see within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled for 1 minute. While grappled, the target is restrained and can use an action on each of its turns to make a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice), freeing itself and ending the effect on a success.
	The effect ends early and frees the target if you move more than 5 feet away from it. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

If that creature's next attack hits, the attack deals extra radiant damage equal to your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).
	In addition, you can use an action to cast the light cantrip while wearing these wraps.

	In addition, while holding the quarterstaff, you can speak its command word as an action to cause it to release a gout of flame from its end, duplicating the effect of the burning hands spell (save DC 13). This property of the quarterstaff can't be used again until the next dawn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This jewel-encrusted pauldron has the distinct appearance of a large conch shell. While wearing this pauldron, you can breathe underwater, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet.
	While worn, the pauldron releases a thin veil of illusory water, creating a small, watery cape behind you. While wearing it, you can use an action to speak its command word to cause the water to become real. When you do, the water pours from the shell in a flooding torrent that extends from you to form a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of water that moves with you and remains centered on the ground beneath you.
	The cylinder lasts as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 10 minutes. However, if you move in such a way that causes you to leave the cylinder, such as by swimming upward and climbing out of it, the effect ends.
	Any creature other than you in the cylinder when it appears must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is pushed away from you to the nearest unoccupied space outside of the cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. Once this property of the pauldron has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>Forged during the Upheaval, these brutish weapons were given to members of the guard to quell any arcanist uprising. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature concentrating on a spell with this weapon, runes start to glow on the weapon's head, and that creature makes the resulting Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration with disadvantage. As an action, you can speak the weapon's command word and hold it aloft, causing the metal book adorning the head of the maul to wildly turn its pages and shatter. When it does, any spell or magical effect within 60 feet of you is dispelled, as if affected by the dispel magic spell (5th-level version). A spell or magical effect cast using a 6th-level spell slot or higher is unaffected in this way. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again and the book disappears from the head of the weapon

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <name>Fool's Lamp (HB)</name>
    <detail>very rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This brass lamp is decorated with flowing patterns around a blue, glass chamber at its center. Swirling, magenta clouds drift within the lamp and billow eagerly whenever it's held. Created as a grim sculpture by a spiteful djinni, this lamp offers no benefit to those foolish enough to encounter it. An identify or legend lore spell correctly reveals the lamp to be empty, as well as its true nature. However, identifying the lamp by any other means will reveal that the lamp has a djinni trapped inside it, allowing it to function as a ring of djinni summoning while held and without requiring attunement. It also reveals that the only way to summon the djinni is to ask it for a wish (such as a wish spell or general command), treating the wish as a command phrase.
	When a creature holding the lamp speaks such a phrase using an action, the GM uses the table below to choose the outcome or determine it randomly:

Fool's Lamp:
d10 | Effect
1 | You're shunted to a harmless demiplane inside the lamp for 1 hour, during which time you can see as if you were in the lamp's space, but are otherwise incapacitated and deafened. At the end of each of your turns while you're in the demiplane, you can make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, ending the effect early on a success. At the end of the duration, you return to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the lamp.
2 | A fireball (5th-level version, save DC 16) erupts, centered on you.
3 | You're unintelligible for 2d6 hours, during which time you only speak in nonsensical sounds.
4 | You're under the effect of the faerie fire spell for 24 hours.
5 | A hostile air (40%), earth (20%), fire (20%), or water (20%) elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
6 | Your legs become unstable for 1d6 hours, during which time you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws, and if you move your full speed on a turn, you must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity check or fall prone.
7 | You're affected by the levitate spell for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, flip a coin and roll a d4. If it's heads, you float up a number of feet equal to 5 times the number rolled on the d4. If it's tails, you float down the same number of feet.
8 | You are under the effect of the suggestion spell for 1d6 hours. If you are asked to do something that isn't harmful, accompanied by the word "please" or a similar phrase, you are compelled to obey.
9 | You age 1d10 years, taking 5 necrotic damage for each year that you age in this way. Your age returns to normal when you finish a long rest. 
10 | Roll twice on the table and use both effects, rerolling any 10s. If a creature affected by the lamp is targeted by the greater restoration spell or similar magic, one of the lamp's effects on the creature ends

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>A lingering fragment of a fire spirit remains attached to this piece of coal, keeping it covered in harmless blue embers that are pleasantly warm to the touch.
	When surrounded by fire, the coal burns with a magical blue flame and the spirit within it emerges. The spirit remains until the fire goes out or is doused, at which point the spirit hides within its coal until immersed in flames once more. If removed from the fire, the spirit moves with the burning coal and remains for up to 1 minute.
	While the spirit is present, it helps tend to the fire it's placed in. The spirit can maintain a fire that fills up to a 5-foot cube. A fire tended to by the spirit gains the following benefits:

	• It can't be extinguished by strong winds.
	• It produces no smoke, unless you want it to.
	• It burns for twice the normal duration with the same amount of fuel.
	• Any food being cooked in the fire is kept at an ideal temperature.

In addition, you have advantage on any ability check you make that uses either cook's utensils or glassblower's, smith's, or tinker's tools to heat and craft items in the fire. If you roll a 15 or higher on the d20, the time it takes to use the tools in this way is halved.

Sentience. The forgekeeper's spark is a sentient lawful neutral item with an Intelligence of 1, a Wisdom of 6, and a Charisma of 1. It is immune to fire damage and has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can't speak or read, but understands Common and Ignan.

Personality. The forgekeeper's spark is happiest in the fires of a forge, but also enjoys maintaining campfires. It is strict with the boundaries of its fire, preventing it from spreading uncontrollably, and is resourceful with how it manages any fuel that it's given.It enjoys assisting with tasks, such as cooking and metalworking, and snaps and pops with excited sparks when given something new to heat up.

The shield has a metallic maw in the visage of a dragon forged into the face of the shield, and small plumes of flame occasionally leap from openings in the shield's plates.
	When a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to retaliate with the shield. When you do, a gout of flame erupts from the shield, forcing the attacker to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 fire damage and ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 1d10 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't ignite. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
	A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

	When you do, there is a 5 percent chance that the petal glimmers in a flash of light as a rune is burnt into it, recreating the effects of the augury spell. When it does, 1d6 new fortune's flowers grow at that petal's location after 30 days if the ground is suited for growth.
	The plant has no seeds and can't be repotted for travel. An unpicked fortune's flower regrows one flower every year. Once picked, the flower can survive up to 7 days before it withers and dies

    <text>This ebony charm is decoratively shaped into a fox's head and is always slightly warm to the touch. It measures 4 inches across and weighs 1/2 pound. If the charm is placed in a sufficiently hot fire, such as in a campfire, forge, or oven that fills up to a 10-foot cube, the charm begins to glow red-hot and creates a harmless, but comfortably warm, fire elemental in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the fire. The elemental is in the form of a fox and can't move farther than 100 feet from the fire in which its charm is kept. The elemental's singular goal is to supply this fire with fuel. If the fire begins to burn out, the elemental will search the surrounding area for fuel that isn't being worn or carried.
	The fox uses the statistics for a cat, except that it's an elemental instead of a beast, is immune to fire and poison damage, and understands Common and Ignan but can't speak. The elemental has advantage on ability checks to find fuel for its source fire and sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. It can carry fuel back to the fire as normal, provided that it's appropriate to the elemental's size. If the elemental drops to 0 hit points, touches fire, or its source fire goes out, it vanishes and the charm grows cold and dark again until it's placed in a new fire.

    <text>This magic spear harnesses both ice and fire to duplicate the natural destructive force of a remorhaz. Immediately after you throw the spear and it hits or misses a target, it flies back to your hand. While holding the spear, it becomes covered in icicles and sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. When you hit with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. You can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause the ice to melt and be replaced with flames, causing the bonus damage to become fire damage instead. You can speak the command word again to extinguish the flames and cause the ice to regrow from the spear, turning the bonus damage to cold damage once more. The ice or flames remain until you drop or stow the spear.
	While the spear is covered in ice, you have resistance to fire damage. While it's covered in flames, you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, while holding the spear, you can use an action to cast the fire shield spell from it. This version of the spell has a range of 30 feet, instead of self, and can target any creature you can see within range. Once this property of the spear has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

When it does, the basalt handle extends, giving the weapon both the reach and versatile (1d10) properties. In addition, while you're raging, the flail deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to any target it hits. You take 1d4 fire damage when the flail transforms in this way and again at the start of each of your turns if you're holding the flail. The flail returns to its normal form and cools if you are no longer holding it at the end of your turn or if your rage ends.

Volcanic Fury. You can use an action to smash the flail into the ground at a point within the weapon's reach. When you do, the ground erupts, spewing a mixture of earth and fire in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature other than you in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d12 bludgeoning damage and 2d12 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. It takes 1 minute to clear an affected 5-foot-square space of the rubble by hand. Once this property of the flail has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

	In addition, when you enter a rage or use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast, you can take on a special aspect, choosing one of the options below.

Aspect of the Dragon. Your skin hardens into plate- like scales, granting you 20 temporary hit points and resistance to fire damage.

Aspect of the Goat. You grow a pair of ram's horns. If you already have horns, this aspect causes them to grow larger and more powerful. When you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target no more than one size larger than you and immediately make a melee weapon attack against it, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Aspect of the Lion. You grow a shimmering mane that wreathes your head and neck, and your teeth become fangs. You have advantage on melee attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated. Each aspect lasts for 1 minute. At the end of the duration, you revert to your normal form or beast shape.

The ring expands into a 5-foot circular stone portal that's 1 foot thick in the space where it lands, floating 1 foot off the ground, where it remains for up to 1 minute.
	The portal duplicates the effect of the gate spell, creating another stone portal at the destination. This version of the spell can't target an individual creature, but can be used to target a precise location on the same plane of existence as you. You can end the spell and close the portal early by speaking the ring's command word again as an action while touching it with your hand. When you do, the ring returns to its normal size and reappears on your hand. If the portal remains for the full duration, the ring returns to its normal size and falls to the ground on a random side of the portal. Once the ring has been used, it can't be used again until 10 days have passed.

While the gauntlets contain a condition in this way, you can use a bonus action to touch a creature and force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers the effects of the stored condition until the end of your next turn, as the condition is passed from the gauntlets into it. Whether the creature succeeds or fails the saving throw, the stored condition is then lost from the gauntlets.
	The gauntlets can only hold one condition at a time. Any contained condition is lost if you contain another one in order to make room for the new condition.

When you roll a 1 or 2 on an attack roll made with this extra beam, you take 3d12 necrotic damage, and until you finish a short or long rest, your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage you take.

    <text>This elegant blade has a gently curved handle and a guard in the shape of a shield. Even if you aren't attuned to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and if you make an opportunity attack with the weapon and hit, the target takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage from the attack.
	If you're attuned to the weapon, the weapon's shield-like guard changes its design to match your family crest. In addition, the sword has 3 charges, which you can use only if you're attuned to it. When you're hit by a ranged attack while holding the sword, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to hold the blade in front of you. Roll a d6. A domed, spectral barrier appears from the blade's tip, granting you a bonus to AC against ranged attacks equal to the number rolled on the d6 until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack. The sword regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>When found, this gi is gray with a large tree design at its bottom hem. When you attune to the gi, its color and tree design changes to resemble the current season: Winter (blue, leafless), Spring (green, pink blossoms), Summer (red, green leaves), or Autumn (Yellow, red leaves along the bottom hem). While the gi resembles a season, it gains the following respective benefits:

Winter. You are immune to the effects of extreme cold, and whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, that creature's speed is reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum speed of 15 feet) until the start of your next turn.

Spring. When the gi changes to this season, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points. In addition, when you use your Step of the Wind, your jump distance is tripled, instead of doubled, and you ignore the effects of difficult terrain until the end of your turn.

Summer. You are immune to the effects of extreme heat, and whenever you hit a target with an unarmed strike, the target takes an additional 2 fire damage. If you are outside during the day, the target takes an additional 3 fire damage, instead.

Autumn. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws. When you use your Patient Defense, creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move within 5 feet of you until the start of your next turn. You can change the gi's season to another one of your choice by spending 1 minute in silent meditation.

Alternatively, whenever you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to spend 1 or more ki points, you can choose to shift the gi's season by one, moving in chronological order. When you do, you choose whether to gain the season's benefits before or after the action. For example,if the gi is in Autumn and you spend 1 ki point to use Flurry of Blows, the gi can immediately change to represent Winter and grant the season's benefits to your Flurry of Blows.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the weapon, you can speak its command word using a bonus action to magically enlarge it. When you do, the weapon grows to three times its normal size until the start of your next turn. While enlarged, this axe has the reach property and deals an extra 2d12 slashing damage to any target it hits. The axe's weight doesn't change. While the axe is enlarged, it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls due to its larger size. Once this property of the axe has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>This worn gladius has been used by numerous famed warriors over centuries. When swung, the sound of a valiant battlecry can be faintly heard. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding this weapon, you gain an additional use of your Second Wind and Action Surge class features, but can use Action Surge only once on a turn.
	As an action, you can speak the weapon's command word to transform it into a different simple or martial melee weapon of your choice. When you do, the weapon glimmers with a golden sheen and becomes mutable, allowing you to use a bonus action to mentally change the weapon's form again for the duration. The weapon remains mutable for 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to end the effect early. It reverts to its normal form when it's no longer mutable.
	While the gladius is transformed into a weapon with the thrown property, it flies back to your hand immediately after you make a ranged attack with it.

Sentience. The gladius of the everfighter is a sentient weapon of lawful neutral alignment with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
	The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a stern and commanding voice. Personality. The gladius of the everfighter is sworn to do battle for eternity. It grows tired of diplomacy quickly and believes that disputes are best settled through combat, either lethal or otherwise. It only finds comradery with its wielder after overcoming a powerful adversary together. It strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time, preferring instead to search out new tests of strength.
	If the gladius enjoys a fight that would normally end in the death of the opposing creature, it can choose to knock the creature out instead of killing it.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

    <text>This long-lost silver glaive once belonged to an elven king. Its impeccable elven make lets it be swung nimbly, despite its size. This weapon has the finesse property. In addition, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Sentience. The glaive is a sentient weapon of chaotic good alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
	The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Elvish and Sylvan.

Personality. The glaive is inhabited by the spirit of Kelren, the elven king of Imfe Mythse. His life's mission to rid his kingdom of demons, fiends, and other unwelcome ilk lives on inside the weapon. He seeks to rebalance the flow and seasons of nature, eager to destroy anything that threatens to change the natural ecosystems of the world.
	Kelren is stern, but honest. He may share stories of his kingdom from time to time if an anecdote serves to further his ambitions. A character who he deems unworthy of wielding the blade, such as a weak or evil creature, may be denied the ability to attune to the weapon.

Elven Kinship. You are considered proficient with this weapon if you are an elf or half-elf. In addition, while attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with fey creatures.

Energy Nullification. If you hit a target with this weapon that is either resistant or immune to cold or fire damage, that target loses that resistance or immunity until the end of your next turn.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>This magic dagger's edge is lined with a sharp, enchanted crystal that magically pierces through glass. While holding the dagger, you can use an action to cut a straight line up to 1 foot long into a piece of nonmagical glass no more than 1 inch thick. Each line emits a faint glow, allowing you to see any lines you've made. Making these lines requires you to focus, as if concentrating on a spell. Your concentration ends early if you are no longer holding the dagger or aren't within reach of the glass. When your concentration ends, any line you made with the dagger magically vanishes and repairs itself.
	You can connect these lines to form a cutout shape in the glass. As part of the action to complete this shape, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DC for this check is equal to 8 plus half the number of actions it took to form the shape. On a success, you silently remove the cutout glass shape. On a failure, the cutout glass shatters. Once the shape is removed in this way, either in one piece or as shattered glass, your concentration ends without repairing the glass.
	If the original glass shape is returned to the hole, you can spend 1 minute retracing the cuts made to the glass with the dagger to seamlessly repair the damage done to it, as if by the mending spell.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

	Alternatively, a creature can regain these additional hit points if you use a healer's kit to stabilize or restore hit points to it. Once a creature regains extra hit points in this way, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.

    <text>These brightly colored gloves extend a peculiar psychic magic to your hands and fingers. While wearing the gloves, you can use an action to cast the mage hand spell from them. In addition, you can use an action to cast the arcane hand spell from the gloves (save DC 16, spell attack +8). Once the gloves have been used to cast this spell, they can't be used to cast it again until the next dawn.
	The gloves have 5 charges for the following properties. They regain 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Applaud. When a creature other than you that can see and hear you rolls a Bardic Inspiration die, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the gloves' charges to clap your hands together and add your Charisma modifier to the total of the roll. You can choose to use this reaction after the creature rolls the die, but before the GM determines whether the roll succeeds or fails.

Barrier. When you're hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the gloves' charges and hold your hands out in front of you, as if you were pressed against an invisible barrier. You gain a +5 bonus to AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

Pinch. By holding your thumb and forefinger less than an inch apart, you can use an action to expend 1 of the gloves' charges to visually pinch a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. The creature takes 3d4 psychic damage and 3d4 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the creature was concentrating on a spell, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain its concentration.

Taunt. You can use an action to remove one of the gloves and expend 1 of their charges to visually slap a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you with it—as if you were challenging it to a duel. That creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d4 psychic damage and 2d4 force damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't suffer disadvantage on its attack rolls. Immediately after the effect, you replace the glove on your hand.

In addition, you gain a burrowing speed of 5 feet.
	While wearing the gloves, you can use a bonus action to invoke the might of a giant badger, granting the following benefits for 1 minute:

	• Your burrowing speed is doubled, and you can burrow through nonmagical, unworked stone.
	• You gain a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls whenever you make an unarmed strike with the gloves.
	• Your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

At the end of the minute, the lock is destroyed and forced open. If the lock's DC is greater than 15, the key has a percent chance to break before the end of the minute.
	The percent chance is equal to 5 times the difference between the lock's DC and 15. If the key breaks, the lock is instead jammed shut and the key is destroyed, but can still be seen protruding from the keyhole.
	While the key is destroying a lock, the sound of breaking tumblers and grating metal can be heard out to a range of 90 feet.

If you are a cleric or paladin, you and each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to half the radiant damage dealt in this way.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This magical gorget is imbued with the divine power of a planetar and has been passed down through multiple generations, manifesting a different power for each wearer. While wearing the gorget, you have resistance to radiant damage and gain the following benefits. If you have a feature that allows you to ignore class, race, or level requirements when you use a magic item, you can choose to gain the benefits of one of these properties. You make this choice the first time you attune to the item.

Investiture of the Planetar. If you have 10 or more levels in the barbarian class, your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 26, and while you're raging, any creature you hit with a melee weapon attack takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage.

Litany of Heaven. If you have 10 or more levels in the bard class, you gain the ability to speak and understand all languages. In addition, whenever you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, that creature regains a number of hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier.

Divine Judge &amp; Jury. If you have 10 or more levels in the cleric class, you always have the commune, dispel evil and good, and raise dead spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In addition, when you cast raise dead using a spell slot, you can choose to cast it as an action, instead of its normal casting time. When you do, the spell requires no material components and returns the target to life with half its maximum hit points. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Herald of Omens. If you have 10 or more levels in the druid class, the gorget becomes covered in vines and leaves. While wearing it, you always have the control weather and insect plague spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In addition, you can use a bonus action to summon a pair of white-feathered wings from your back. While the wings exist, you have a flying speed of 60 feet. The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.

Unstoppable Legionnaire. If you have 10 or more levels in the fighter class, you can't be charmed or frightened, and you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

Angelic Grace. If you have 10 or more levels in the monk class, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you have advantage on ability checks to resist being grappled. In addition, while you aren't wearing any armor, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC.

Caress of Life. If you have 10 or more levels in the paladin class, your Lay on Hands pool of healing power increases by 10 hit points. In addition, you can expend 10 hit points from your pool of healing to end the effects of blindness, deafness, or paralysis on a creature. Alternatively, you can expend 15 hit points from the pool to end a curse affecting a creature or object, as if by the remove curse spell.

Sight of the Celestial Warden. If you have 10 or more levels in the ranger class, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and gain truesight outto 15 feet. In addition, you can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty and are able to discern fine details as though looking at something from no more than 100 feet away.

Heavenly Messenger. If you have 10 or more levels in the rogue class, you can use a bonus action to cast the invisibility spell (no concentration required) from the gorget, targeting only yourself. Once the spell has been cast, it can't be cast again until you finish a short or long rest. In addition, you can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.

Luminous Soul. If you have 10 or more levels in the sorcerer class, you learn the light and dancing lights cantrips as well as the guiding bolt spell, which don't count against your number of cantrips or sorcerer spells known. You can cast guiding bolt by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points and hit a target, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the start of your next turn. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change its damage type to radiant.

Pact of Veracious Awareness. If you have 10 or more levels in the warlock class, you know if you hear a lie. If you hear a creature tell a lie, you can attempt to force that creature to tell the truth. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be compelled to answer the next question you ask it truthfully. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Celestial Wards. If you have 10 or more levels in the wizard class, your AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier (your choice). In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

    <text>This grotesquely carved stone staff is miraculously light but deathly cold and clammy to the touch. You have resistance to necrotic damage while you hold this staff.
	The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: arcane hand (5 charges), bestow curse (3 charges), chill touch (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level), inflict wounds (1 charge per spell level, up to 5th), mage hand (no charges), or vampiric touch (3 charges).
	The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to ash and summons 2d6 hostile tiny undead crawling hands within 10 feet of you.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: simple, staff, quarterstaff

When you take the Attack action while wearing this garment, you can replace one or more of your attacks with a special ranged spell attack using the cloak, expending 1 of its charges for each attack you replace. When you do, you flourish the cloak and release a barrage of magical feathers that fly toward the target. You have a +5 bonus to attack rolls made with the cloak, which have a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 + 3 force damage. After the attack, the feathers vanish.
	In addition, you can use a reaction when you fall to cast the feather fall spell from the cloak, targeting only yourself. Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These dark green adamantine and copper bracers are granted to devout warriors of the Infernal Court and are designed to match their army's signature tower shields. While wearing the bracers, you grow a sweeping pair of horns from your forehead if you are not a tiefling. If your attunement to the bracers ends, the horns crack and fall away after 24 hours.
	The bracers have a total of 7 charges and regain all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing them, you can expend 1 or more of their charges to use the following three properties:

"Brace Yourselves!" As a bonus action, you can expend 2 or more charges from the bracers to provide cover to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. For 2 charges, you summon a large, spectral shield that follows the creature for the duration, providing it with half cover. You can summon one extra shield for each additional charge you expend, targeting a different creature with each one. The shields fade at the end of your next turn.

"Press the Assault!" When you make an opportunity attack, you can expend 1 or more of the bracers' charges to embolden your nearby allies. For each charge you spend, one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you can use its reaction to make one weapon attack. The chosen creatures must be able to see or hear you.

"You Will Burn!" You can expend 1 or more charges from the bracers to cast the hellish rebuke spell (save DC 15) from them. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. The fire from this spell is a haunting emerald green.

Flaw. The Green Knight's vow makes its wearer tremendously loyal to royalty. While attuned to the bracers, you gain the following flaw: "I will stand by my sovereign leader, no matter what." You or your GM determine who your leader is. In addition, if you are attuned to the bracers for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty drives you to the brink of zealotry. You can't attune to the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise. If you are already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your sovereign leader, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the bracers

The prosthesis attaches to your arm at the elbow or the shoulder, and it can't be removed against your will as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your arm for the entire attunement period. While attuned to the prosthesis, you can use an action to remove or reattach it. The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body.
	While the prosthesis is attached, you gain a +3 bonus to saving throws. As a bonus action, you can touch a creature to transfer this bonus to it. When you do, the bonus remains on that creature, instead of you, for 1 minute, until it dies, or until you use a bonus action to return the bonus to yourself.
	In addition, the prosthetic has 10 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it: greater restoration (5 charges), lesser restoration (2 charges), protection from evil and good (1 charge), remove curse (3 charges), or warding bond (2 charges). The prosthetic regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Final Sacrifice. As an action, you can use the prosthetic to cast either mass heal or true resurrection.
	When you do, the prosthetic releases a massive burst of divine light as the bones inside it are destroyed. The prosthetic then loses all its properties, but it can still be used as a magical prosthetic that functions as a fully capable part of your body and no longer requires attunement.

    <text>This magic, twisting blowgun channels the air around it to create powerful blasts of wind. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d4 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away from you. Attacking at long range with this weapon doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with it. The blowgun has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
	As an action, you can expend 1 of its charges to blow through the weapon to create a line of wind 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Any Medium or smaller creature in the line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

    <text>This golden scepter has an empty basin at its end that's always hot to the touch, as if it had been left out in the sun. While attuned to the rod, you can walk normally on difficult terrain caused by sand and can tolerate temperatures as hot as 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
	The rod has 20 charges for the following properties. It regains 2d6 + 8 expended charges daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of sand.

Sandblast. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and send out a cascade of pressurized sand at a target you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll using the scepter with an attack bonus of +10. On a hit, the sand deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage and disappears after the attack.

Sandstorm. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 5 charges to cause a flurry of sand to whip up and swirl around you. The sand creates a blistering maelstrom that follows you in a 15-foot radius, 30-foot-high cylinder and makes the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles fly upward and automatically miss when they enter the area. Any creature that moves into the sandstorm for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You are immune to this bludgeoning damage. The sand disappears once the storm subsides. If you are standing on sandy ground while concentrating on a sandstorm, you can use a bonus action to teleport to another unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you that is also on sandy ground.

Sand Summon. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 3 charges to cause the ground in a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you to turn to shifting sands for up to 1 minute. You can end the effect early as a bonus action. For the duration, a creature must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves through the area.

Soul of the H'rethi. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 3 charges to summon a sand elemental in an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet of you that's covered in sand. Use the statistics for an earth elemental for this elemental, with the following changes:

	• The sand elemental can only move through areas of sandy terrain.

	• The sand elemental has advantage on any ability check it makes to grapple a creature. The elemental remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to a maximum of 1 hour, and disappears early if it drops to 0 hit points. It is friendly to you and your companions for the duration.

Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

    <range>20/60</range>
    <text>This dart doubles as a magical quill and is fletched with three iridescent crow feathers. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this magic weapon, it flies back to your hand. When you make a ranged attack with the dart, you can speak its first command word as part of the attack to cause the dart to release a splatter of ink. If the attack hits, the target is blind until the end of its next turn. A creature can use its action to clear away the ink on itself or another creature within its reach, allowing it to see again. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
	When used as a quill, the dart produces its own ink unless you provide it with a different one. You can choose what color ink the quill produces by speaking its second command word as a bonus action. In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak the quill's third command word to cause it to vanish and reappear as a feather-like tattoo on your body. You choose the design and placement of the tattoo each time. You can use a bonus action to speak the command word again while you have the tattoo to cause it to vanish and reappear as a dart in a free hand or at your feet (your choice).

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Charges. This armor has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at midday. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC, spellcasting ability modifier, and spell attack bonus:

	• 1 charge: cure wounds, inflict wounds
	• 2 charges: blindness/deafness, lesser restoration
	• 3 charges: bestow curse, remove curse
	• 4 charges: banishment, death ward
	• 5 charges: contagion, mass cure wounds
	• 6 charges: harm, heal

Curse. This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. This curse can only be removed by a wish spell or similar magic, removing the armor fails to end the curse. While you're cursed, you are blind, but have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet while wearing this armor. In addition, whenever you hit a creature with an attack or cast a spell that affects a creature other than yourself, you take 3 psychic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This colorful, frumpy hat contains the animated and sentient spirit of a wizard's old pet. While unworn and immobile, it is indistinguishable from a normal hat. When the hat is worn and spoken to or otherwise interacted with, it springs to life and pulls its seams apart to form a stitch-ridden mouth and toothless smile.
	You can use the hat as an arcane focus for your wizard spells while you're wearing it. In addition, you can feed one piece of paper to the hat using an action, destroying the paper. The hat happily accepts any paper it's fed and wiggles about as the page is chewed and swallowed.
	If you're wearing the hat, you immediately know any information that was contained on the piece of paper as if you had read it. If the paper or its contents were magical, it's immediately spat back out by the hat. If the paper contained a spell, such as a spell scroll or page from another wizard's spellbook, you also take 1d6 psychic damage for each level of the spell that was transcribed on the paper when it's spat out.

Sentience. The hat of osnomnosis is a sentient chaotic good item with an Intelligence of 4, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 6. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. It can't speak or read, but can communicate with you telepathically while you're wearing it. When the hat communicates with you in this way, it can only transmit simple emotions and images. While you are attuned to it, the hat understands every language you know.

Personality. The hat loves nothing more than being worn and eating bits of paper and is easily befriended by creatures who pet it. The hat's button eyes can't move, but it uses its cloth folds to change its expression at will.

    <text>This bullseye lantern magically creates its own light, which is always a brilliant red. It emits bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.
	While holding the lantern, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to release an intense burst of light from the lantern's lens. Each hostile creature within the lantern's bright light must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be marked for 1 minute. For the duration, marked creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. Marked creatures can't benefit from being invisible, and any attack roll made with disadvantage against a marked creature is made normally instead, provided that the attacker can see it.
	You choose the direction of the light when you use this property, which can't be used again until the next dawn

    <name>Heart of Damned Intervention (HB)</name>
    <detail>legendary (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This large infernal heart was torn from a powerful archdevil and is 1 foot tall and weighs 10 pounds. It still pulses, softly, and spews out small gouts of flame from an unquenchable fire within. The heart is hot to the touch and is wrapped by strange, writhing chains.
	There is a glimmer of good in this heart that can be used to purify it. While attuned to the heart, you have resistance to fire damage, and you can cast hellish rebuke as a 2nd-level spell at will.

Curse. This heart can only be purified and destroyed by a powerful celestial or deity, and attuning to it overwhelms your heart with its evil desires. The heart is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. When you attune to the heart, the heart's flames turn pitch black as it painfully sears into your body, taking the place of your own heart, and taints your connection to the gods. You take 15d6 necrotic damage, leaving chain-shaped scars across your torso, and your alignment becomes evil if it wasn't already. While cursed, you and other creatures within 100 feet of you are unable to magically communicate with any god, and any radiant damage you deal becomes necrotic damage instead. In addition, you can understand and speak Infernal, and you have disadvantage on attack rolls against devils and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
	If you die while cursed in this way, your soul is bound to the lower planes and can only be restored to life by a wish spell or divine intervention. Only a deity or a wish spell cast by a good-aligned creature can end this curse, destroying the heart of damned intervention and restoring your original heart and connection to the gods. In addition, while you're cursed, you can use an action to speak a devil's true name to summon it, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. The devil must have a challenge rating of 6 or lower. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can tell the devil what to do on its next turn (no action required). If you don't issue a command, the devil spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that's attacked it. The devil disappears and returns to its plane of origin after 1 hour or when it reaches 0 hit points. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
	While cursed, you lose your Channel Divinity feature, and you gain the Channel Damnation ability below instead:

Channel Damnation. As an action, you point your finger at a creature you can see within 120 feet of you and speak a powerful, damning curse. That creature and all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to 1d12 + your cleric or paladin level and is bound by searing, hellish chains. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much fire damage and isn't bound by the chains. A bound creature's speed is halved, and it takes 1d12 fire damage at the start of each of its turns for up to 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This metal ribcage pendant has 12 pairs of ribs that contain a single, roughly hewn ruby that rattles around inside. The pendant has 1d4 + 8 charges when found. When a charge is expended, a pair of the pendant's ribs magically rust.
	While wearing this pendant, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the pendant's charges when a hostile creature that you can see within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, causing the target to immediately die before any magical effects or traits can either restore it to life or prevent it from falling to 0 hit points. When you do, you gain 2d6 + 25 temporary hit points, and that creature can't be restored to life by any spell of 5th level or lower. A creature is immune to this effect if it has legendary actions. When you expend the pendant's last charge, the ribcage shatters and releases the ruby inside. When it does, the ruby crackles with necrotic energy and summons 12 skeletons that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 60 feet of you. The summoned skeletons are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the skeletons' statistics.
	A skeleton disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 24 hours.
	Once the ribcage shatters and the ruby summons the skeletons, the pendant and gemstone crumble into ashes and are destroyed.

    <text>This ornate dagger is made of multiple pieces that magically hover together, but move as if they were solidly connected. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to any creature it hits. This extra damage increases to 4d4 radiant damage if the creature is a fiend or undead.
	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a fiend, the target must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is banished, as if by the banishment spell. This version of the spell doesn't require concentration but ends early if you become incapacitated or die within the next minute. On a successful save, the creature is blinded until the start of your next turn and isn't banished.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, dagger

	The maul has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with the maul, you can expend up to 3 of its charges as part of the attack. When you do, the target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is launched 10 feet away from you for each expended charge, or half as far on a successful one. If the target hits a solid object by being launched in this way, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it had left to travel from the impact. If the solid object is a creature, that creature takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage from the impact as the target of the attack.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, maul

When a potion of healing (of any rarity) is poured into the cup, a cleric, paladin, or other creature with a magical connection to a celestial can spend 1 minute reciting a prayer over it. At the end of the prayer, the potion becomes sanctified and begins to glow with a calming blue light. When a potion of healing becomes sanctified, it creates a pool of hit points equal to the maximum number of potential regained hit points possible for that potion.
	When a creature drinks from a sanctified potion of healing, that creature can restore a number of hit points of its choice, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool. When the pool is reduced to 0 hit points, the potion is gone.
	A potion remains sanctified for 24 hours or until it's spilled or poured into another vessel. Once this property of the goblet has been used, it can't be used again for 24 hours.

    <text>This heavy set of plate mail is 5½ feet tall, weighs 100 pounds, and is reconfigured from the pieces of an iron golem. Despite the armor's larger size, a series of clever harnesses inside its chest piece comfortably support you inside it. While wearing this armor, your Strength score is 19, unless it's already higher, and you are considered to be a Medium creature. Magic currents run through the inside of the armor and connect to you, allowing you to control the metal limbs as if they were your own. This magical connection causes you to still take any damage you receive while wearing the armor.
	While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to force the armor to move more rapidly. When it does, you gain the effect of the haste spell (no concentration required), and the armor's joints creak and groan from the increased strain. At the end of each of your turns while you're under this effect, there is a cumulative 20 percent chance that the armor overheats. When it does, you take 1d10 fire damage from the armor, and the effect ends. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

If the wearer has a Strength score lower than 15, their speed is reduced by 10 feet.

Your scales twist into strange, fractal-like patterns tinged with otherworldly colors when you attune to this item. While wearing the helmet, you have resistance to psychic damage, and creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks against you. In addition, your breath weapon changes to be a plume of unearthly psionic energy, dealing psychic damage instead of its normal damage type. A creature in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw, instead of your breath weapon's normal save. On a failed save, a creature is also affected as by the bane spell for 1 minute as maddening whispers fill its mind. The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your breath weapon DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Curse. This helmet is cursed with gnawing insecurity and self-doubt. Attuning to the helmet curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While cursed, you are unwilling to remove the helm, and you gain the following flaw: "Whatever course of action I take, there is a voice in my head that screams at me to do the opposite. The voice is never silent."

When you do, you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be shunted onto a harmless demiplane inside the vase. A Large or larger creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw, but a willing Medium or smaller creature can choose to fail it. If a creature is already on the demiplane when you remove the lid, that creature reappears in the nearest unoccupied space, and you automatically succeed on the saving throw. Immediately after opening the vase in this way, the lid flies back and reseals the vase.
	While on this demiplane, you can't move and are blinded, but can hear everything outside of the vase as if you were standing in its space. You can leave this demiplane using an action to reappear in the nearest unoccupied space. When you attempt to leave the demiplane, a creature outside the vase can use its reaction to hold the vase's lid shut and make a DC 25 Strength check, preventing you from leaving on a success.
	The vase has AC 12, 30 hit points, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. The vase is destroyed if it drops to 0 hit points. If the vase is destroyed while a creature is on its demiplane, that creature is forced into the nearest unoccupied space. Once a creature leaves the demiplane, the vase's lid can't be removed again for 24 hours. You can remain on the demiplane for up to 8 hours or until the vase is placed inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item, at which time you are forcefully shunted out of it. If the lid is successfully held in place when you would be forcefully shunted from the demiplane in this way, the vase shatters and is destroyed.
	While holding the vase, you can use an action to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the vessel. The vase's weight doesn't change. Regardless of its appearance, the vase can't be anything but a vase.

Uncommon and rare carts have handles and a single wheel at their front and must be physically moved. Very rare versions have a flying speed of 10 feet, can hover up to 20 feet off the ground, and move according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of the cart.
	The cart has two command words. The first command word can be spoken using an action and causes the cart to shrink or enlarge, becoming as small as 1 foot long and 7 inches across or as large as 5 feet long and 3 feet across. Regardless of its size, the cart always weighs 5 pounds without anything inside it. Anything contained by the cart does not resize to fit its new size, potentially spilling onto the ground if the cart becomes too small.
	When you place a nonliving object in the cart, you can speak the cart's second command word as an action to cause the object to become locked in place. A locked object can't be removed or interacted with against your will, unless the cart becomes too small to contain it. A creature that attempts to remove an object locked in this way must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the cart for 1 minute. A frightened creature is unwilling to move toward the cart or interact with it for the duration. If the cart is a rare or very rare version, the creature also takes 0 psychic damage on a failed saving throw. A creature that succeeds on the DC 13 saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours. You can speak the second command word as an action again to unlock any number of objects within the cart.

The first command word can be spoken using an action and causes the cart to shrink or enlarge, becoming as small as 1 foot long and 7 inches across or as large as 5 feet long and 3 feet across. Regardless of its size, the cart always weighs 5 pounds without anything inside it. Anything contained by the cart does not resize to fit its new size, potentially spilling onto the ground if the cart becomes too small.
	When you place a nonliving object in the cart, you can speak the cart's second command word as an action to cause the object to become locked in place. A locked object can't be removed or interacted with against your will, unless the cart becomes too small to contain it. A creature that attempts to remove an object locked in this way must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the cart for 1 minute. A frightened creature is unwilling to move toward the cart or interact with it for the duration. If the cart is a rare or very rare version, the creature also takes 6d6 psychic damage on a failed saving throw. A creature that succeeds on the DC 16 saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours. You can speak the second command word as an action again to unlock any number of objects within the cart.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This piece of gnarled root has several bulbous openings along its twisted length. Enchanted by powerful druids, this root has a tiny door and a small, chimney-like protrusion from its larger end. While holding it, a tiny plume of illusory smoke emanates from the chimney.
	You can bury and plant this root in soil over the course of 1 minute. If the root remains buried for 1 hour, it then immediately grows underground to create a comfortable, wooden dwelling (provided that there's enough room to grow), and a stump appears from the ground where the root was buried. The stump has a simple round door carved into it that is large enough for a Medium or smaller creature to enter. The door appears and opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening. The door opens to reveal a tunnel 15 feet deep and lined with ladder-like rungs made of twisting roots.
	At the bottom of the tunnel is a large, circular room that's 30 feet in diameter with 10-foot-high ceilings. The room is brightly lit by bioluminescent fungi that grow along its wooden walls and ceiling. You can magically control the light in the room by touching the luminous fungi, allowing you to fill the room with total darkness, dim light, or bright light.
	A single hallway leads away from the room. Four doors line the hallway, which each lead to a room that's 10 feet in diameter with a 10-foot-high ceiling. Every room is decorated with various pieces of wooden furniture made from coiled roots and other magically occurring plant growth, such as tables, chairs, or a bed, depending on the needs of the creature who planted the root. At the end of the hallway hangs a single red root.
	You can use a bonus action to pull the root to cause the hallway to extend upward into a tunnel, complete with a root-like ladder, and create a second, temporary entrance to the dwelling in an unoccupied space 60 feet away from the entrance stump. The temporary entrance is well-hidden, noticeable only with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, and remains until the start of your next turn.
	A creature that casts the plant growth spell as an action can redesign the appearance and furniture in one of the dwelling's rooms. If the spell is cast over the course of 8 hours, the creature can redesign the appearance and furniture of the entire dwelling instead, except for the location of the entrance stump. A conscious druid or ranger inside the dwelling is aware of any Small or larger creature that comes within 60 feet of the dwelling's entrance, and magically knows only the creature's size and gait, such as the gallop of a horse or walk of a humanoid.
	The entrance stump has 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a plant growth spell cast on the stump can repair it, with each casting restoring 10 hit points to it, or all its hit points if cast over the course of 8 hours. If the stump is destroyed, the dwelling collapses and magically shunts anything inside it (other than the furniture) to the nearest unoccupied space next to where the root was buried. When this happens, the earth magically returns to the way it was before the root was buried.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These well-worn boots have an ever-changing arcane circle ingrained into their heels. While wearing the boots, you can use an action to speak their first command word to create an arcane circle, as per the teleportation circle spell, on the ground below you. The circle appears as a trail of dirt or similar muck from the bottom of the shoe, and is treated as a permanent one for the purposes of this spell. Speaking the first command word again destroys the first circle, magically cleaning the surface it was placed on, before creating a new one at your location.
	You can speak the boots' second command word as an action while wearing them to cast the teleportation circle spell, except that this circle is only 5 feet in diameter. This circle's sigil sequence matches the one created by the first command word and links to its location. When it's created, the circle appears under your feet, centered on your location, and you immediately teleport through it. Only a circle created in this way can connect to the permanent one created by the boots' first command word. If the permanent circle is washed away or otherwise cleaned or destroyed before you speak the second command word, the spell fails and the circle isn't created.
	Once you use the boots to teleport in this way, they can't do so again until 1d3 days have passed. In the meantime, you can still speak the boots' first command word.

    <text>This sea-tumbled glass bottle has a miniature sailing ship assembled inside it. The bottle weighs 1 pound and is magically sealed with red wax. Despite there being no wind in the bottle, the vessel's sails seemingly billow and turn on their own.
	You can speak the bottle's command word to cause the wax to come apart and open the bottle. When the open bottle is submerged in a large enough body of water, the ship inside it magically slips out, destroying the bottle, and becomes a sailing ship 50 feet long and 15 feet wide. A crew of 10 unseen servants remain on the ship at all times and can be commanded by you or any creature that is friendly to you while on board to adjust the ship's sails and direction. The ship's reduced size halves the vessel's normal creature and cargo capacity, but is otherwise treated as if it were a normal sailing ship.
	If you keep a similarly sized glass bottle aboard the vessel, the ship and its unseen crew magically reduce in size and appear inside the newly sealed bottle when the ship is run aground. The bottle must have been submerged in the ocean for at least 10 years, and anything onboard the ship when it is resealed falls to the water or ground below.

    <text>This large, spiraling warhorn has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 charge and blow the horn, summoning a war elk as if you had cast the find steed spell. A war elk uses the same statistics as a giant elk with the following changes: its size is Large, it has AC 14 (hide barding), and has 37 hit points. The steed disappears if your attunement to the horn ends. Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 1 of the horn's charges to speak its command word and then blow the horn. When you do, a spectral stampede of elk trample the area in a line 60 feet long and 15 feet wide that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
	When you blow the horn, it emits a deep, rumbling tone that is audible 300 feet away

    <text>These two magical weapons are bound by a powerful force. Despite there being two weapons, you only need to attune to one of them to use their properties. While holding one of the weapons, you can use an action to determine the distance and direction of the other paired weapon as long as you're on the same plane of existence.
	If you attune to one of the weapons while another creature is attuned to the other, you are each aware of the other creature's attunement and must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The creature that wins the contest remains attuned to the item, and for the next 24 hours, its attunement cannot be broken by another creature attempting to attune to the other weapon. The creature that loses the contest is no longer attuned to the weapon. While holding both weapons in either hand, you gain several benefits:

	• You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons.

	• Your perception of time is slightly quickened: allowing you to dodge attacks that would have normally hit you. You gain a +1 bonus to AC.

	• When you roll a 20 on an attack roll using Hour (the dagger) against a creature, that creature is subjected to the effect of the slow spell until the end of your next turn.

	• When you roll a 20 on an attack roll using Minute (the shortsword), you gain the effect of the haste spell until the start of your next turn. When the effect ends, you don't suffer the normal effects of the spell ending.

	• In addition, you can use an action to lay the two weapons down on the ground. When you do, they magically point north before spinning around to align and tell the current time. When they do, 12:00 is always facing north.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, dagger

    <text>This ebony and gold hourglass is filled with nebulous clouds of dreamy smoke instead of sand. The hourglass can act as a 1-minute timer, allowing the smoke to filter from one chamber to the next for the duration.
	The hourglass has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. While holding it, you can expend 1 or more of the glass's charges to turn it over and cast the sleep spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
	This version of the spell has the following changes:

	• The spell lasts until the hourglass's timer ends or is stopped, or until the hourglass is flipped again.

	• Each time a sleeping creature takes damage, it must make a Constitution saving throw, waking up on a success. The DC is equal to 20 minus half the damage dealt (minimum DC 10). After 3 failed saves, a creature automatically wakes up.

The aura affects creatures other than yourself within 10 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute. For the duration, when a creature within the aura attempts to speak or utter the verbal components of a spell, it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak or produce the verbal components of a spell until the start of its next turn, and any action, bonus action, or reaction it used to do so is wasted. This property of the ring can't be used again until the next dusk.

	• When you use your reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can make a second attack against that same target as part of that reaction.

	• You can make an opportunity attack, even if you've already used your reaction.

	• When you are forced to make a saving throw against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious, you can use your reaction to make the saving throw with advantage.

	• When you take more than 25 damage from a single attack or effect, you can use your reaction to regain 10 hit points. If this damage would reduce you to 0 hit points but not kill you outright, you drop to 1 hit point instead and do not regain 10 hit points.

	• When your head would be cut off by an effect, such as by a vorpal sword, you can use your reaction to negate the effect.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This set of midnight-colored gloves effervesce with slow wisps of smoke, and were famously worn by a royal assassin who had been freed of their bindings.
	At the hems are old, well-worn manacles that have been fastened to the gloves and magically clasp onto your forearms when worn. If you're missing any arms, hands, or fingers when you attune to the gloves, dark, smoky copies of the missing appendages magically rematerialize. The limbs are fully capable parts of your body and remain as long as you're attuned to the gloves.
	While attuned to the gloves, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. You can see normally in magical and nonmagical darkness within this range. If you already have darkvision, wearing the gloves increases its range by 60 feet, although you can only see within magical darkness within the first 60 feet of its range.
	The gloves have 7 charges which are used for the following properties while wearing them. They regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

"Allow Me!" When an attacker that you can see within 15 feet of you deals damage to a friendly creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the gloves' charges to immediately move up to 15 feet, and make one weapon attack against the attacker. On a hit, you have advantage on attack rolls against that target until the end of your next turn.

"By His Will!" You can use a bonus action to expend 3 of the gloves' charges to surround yourself with a dark, smoking aura of retribution. The aura extends from you in a 15-foot radius, creating an area of magical darkness. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. When a hostile creature enters this darkness for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 2d8 necrotic damage. If you roll an 8 on both of the damage dice for this effect, the creature becomes magically grappled by the aura's smoky tendrils. The creature remains grappled until it's no longer within the aura, or until it uses an action to make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice), escaping the grapple on a success. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you die, are incapacitated, or end the effect early using a bonus action.

"The Price of Freedom!" When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend 2 of the gloves' charge to magically take that damage, instead of the creature taking it. Alternatively, if a creature that you can see within this range becomes blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, you can use this reaction to suffer the effects of that condition instead of the target creature.

Flaw. The Indigo Stray's conviction compels its wearer to take swift, decisive action to prove themselves. While attuned to the gloves, you gain the following flaw: "I will do what I must to demonstrate my ability, and I won't stop until a job is done." In addition, if you are attuned to the bracers for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to prove yourself drives you to obsession, and even minor acts of kindness compel you to feel heavily indebted. You can't attune to the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise. If you are already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to the Violet King's promise becomes your sovereign leader, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the gloves.

When you attune to the chain, it magically coils up one of your arms (your choice) and secures itself in place. When you swing it, the chain magically extends from you before returning to coil around your arm once again. You must use a hand in order to swing and use the chain. When swung, the chain releases flames and billowing smoke. This magic weapon has the reach and heavy properties, and any target hit with it takes an extra 1d8 fire damage.
	You can choose to use this chain instead of your normal reach when you grapple a target on your turn. While a target is grappled by the chain, you can't use the chain to make a weapon attack, but you can use a bonus action to pull the target 5 feet toward you. At the start of each of its turns, a creature grappled by the chain takes 2d8 fire damage. A creature grappled by the chain doesn't have its speed reduced as a result of the grapple, but it can't move farther than 10 feet away from you until the grapple ends.

Curse. This chain is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unable to remove the chain from your arm, and at the start of each of your turns while a celestial is within 30 feet of you (that you are aware of), you must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to use your action to attack the nearest celestial. In addition, while cursed, you gain the following flaw: "I delight in exploiting my enemy's flaws and fears to make them suffer."

The tome is magical and devours any smaller nonmagical book or document placed next to it with rows of hidden teeth over the course of 1 minute. After the tome has eaten a book, you can use an action to speak the tome's command word, followed by the name of a book or document it's eaten, to cause the previously destroyed contents to appear on the blank pages of the book. The contents are magically printed on the tome's pages in the same language or cipher they were originally written in and remain until you speak the tome's command word again to erase them or replace them with another document's contents.
	The tome dislikes the taste of magic. Any swallowed pages containing spells, magical sigils, or arcane scrolls are harmlessly spat back out by the tome. However, any notes, spells, or magical sigils that are written in the tome (instead of having been eaten by it) can be recalled if they're either dated, labeled, or titled. Written commentary, notes, and other such addenda to documents within the tome are saved by it and appear whenever the document is recalled again.

When a creature with one or more Enervation dice that you can see makes an ability check or attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll any number of its Enervation dice, which are the same as your Bardic Inspiration dice, and subtract the result from the total of the roll. The Enervation dice are then lost. You can wait to use this reaction until after the creature rolls the d20, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. If the total of the roll is reduced to 0 or lower as a result of the Enervation die, the creature also takes 6d6 necrotic damage.
	A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 necrotic damage.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
	In addition, this weapon has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack with the weapon, you can choose to expend 1 of its charges. Hit or miss, the weapon explodes into thorny shrapnel after it reaches the target.
	The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creatures takes 1d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target was hit by the attack, it automatically fails the saving throw.
	Immediately after the weapon explodes, the seed reappears at your location and regrows the weapon into your hand.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>This silver spoon once belonged to a mystic with an unending appetite. It has three runes etched into the metal that perform various magical functions.

	• Ulm, in the bowl of the spoon, enhances the flavor of any soup or similarly spoonable dish by drawing out the more nuanced flavors that are often overlooked.

	• Tox, on the back of the spoon's head, causes the spoon to tarnish and dim when touched by a poison. The spoon remains this way until the next dawn, when its normal luster magically reappears.

	• Seera, on the handle, strengthens the power of certain psychic effects. While the spoon is on your person and you roll psychic damage, you can focus your attention on the spoon (no action required) to deal maximum damage on one of the damage dice. Once this rune has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you attempt to grapple a creature on your turn as part of the Attack action, you can use the tentacle to target a creature within 15 feet of you that you can see, instead of within your normal reach.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This small and rusted anchor charm is bound to a famous, lost ship: the Lady Phantasma. This ship and its crew was lost to the Ethereal Plane centuries ago, cursed to remain there for all eternity as punishment for stealing a powerful sea hag's treasured relic. However, this small charm can act as the ship's sole remaining tether to the Material Plane.
	As an action, you can call out to the ship while holding the charm aloft. If you're within 30 feet of a body of water on the Material Plane, a full-sized anchor appears on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the water. A wispy, green chain appears on the anchor that extends into nothingness for 1 minute. At the end of the minute, the Lady Phantasma emerges from the Ethereal Plane, pulled by the anchor's chain, and comes to rest in the water nearby. The ship is a longship 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. It's piloted by thirty-four crew members and five officers, all of whom are long-dead, ghostly remains of their former selves. They are formless and harmless, but are nevertheless visible and friendly to you and your companions. They can interact with the rigging, sails, and other equipment on the ship, but nothing else while they remain on the Material Plane. While the ship remains, you are considered the captain of the vessel while the charm is on your person. At dawn, the ship's crew is shunted back to the Ethereal Plane, leaving the ship behind, until the following dusk when they reappear on the vessel once more. The ship's anchor is immovable while the crew is on the Ethereal Plane, holding the ship in place until they return each night. While the ship can move, it moves at a speed of 10 miles per hour, even when there isn't any wind.
	If the charm is removed from the Lady Phantasma for 24 hours, the ship and its crew vanish and return to the Ethereal Plane until they're summoned again. You can speak the charm's command phrase "Until the tides call once more," to cause the ship and crew to return to the Ethereal Plane early. Any objects on the ship other than what was there when it came from the Ethereal Plane are dropped into the water below the ship when it disappears. If the ship is destroyed while on the Material Plane, the charm is destroyed and turns to flecks of nonmagical rust.

	The dagger has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. When you hit a humanoid with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to immediately recreate the effect of the disguise self spell (save DC 15), taking on the appearance of the target.
	When you do, the dagger's metal face changes to match the appearance. This version of the spell allows you to seem up to 3 feet shorter or taller when taking on the target's appearance.
	When you take on a creature's appearance in this way, that creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and all ability checks as long as it can see you while you share its appearance in this way.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

In addition, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier for any attack or damage roll made with it, instead of Strength or Dexterity.
	When a hostile creature within the whip's reach casts a spell, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack against that creature with the whip. On a hit, the target must make a saving throw using its spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you learn the level of the creature's highest remaining spell slot, and the creature takes extra force damage equal to that number. When a creature takes force damage from the whip in this way, you can choose to recover an expended spell slot of a level equal to or less than the force damage dealt, up to 3rd level. Once the whip has been used to recover a spell slot in this way, it can't do so again until the next dusk.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

When a creature that you can see within 120 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to speak the hourglass's command word and spin it, allowing you to immediately take an extra turn, interrupting the current turn. At the end of your turn, the dead creature returns to life with a number of hit points equal to your current hit point total (up to its hit point maximum), and you die.
	If the dead creature was prone, it can immediately stand up (no action required). Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until 1 year has passed.
	When you die as a result of using the hourglass, your body is enchanted by protective magic for 3 hours. During this time, if a spell, such as raise dead, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you. In addition, while you're protected by this magic, you are also under the effect of the gentle repose spell.

    <text>As an action, you can speak this magic sling's command word and hurl a tiny ball of light at a point or target you can see within 30 feet of you. The ball of light sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. On a hit, the ball deals no damage and sticks to the target for up to 1 minute, until the sling is used to hurl another ball of light, or until a creature within reach of the light uses its action to snuff it out (as if snuffing out a candle). If the target is an unwilling creature or an object being worn or carried by one, the creature must also make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the ball sticks to the target for the duration. On a successful save, the ball of light winks out.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

In addition, the first time you have advantage on an attack roll and miss using this weapon on each of your turns, the target takes 1d6 lightning damage as stray sparks leap from the blade to shock the target.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These hefty boots are miraculously light to walk in. As a bonus action, you can click your heels together while wearing the boots to hover 1 foot off the floor. You can move as normal while hovering in this way using your walking speed, skating above the ground on a plume of blue light. The light sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
	As an action, you can speak the boots' command word to cause their light to shine brighter, emitting bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for another 40 feet until the end of your turn. As part of this action, you can immediately move up to your walking speed across any horizontal or vertical surface, including walls or upside down along ceilings. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks and leaves a trail of blue light behind you. At the end of this movement, the trail of light solidifies, becoming a radiant blue wall that extends perpendicularly from the surface on which you moved, excluding your current space. The wall is translucent, 1/4 inch thick, and up to 10 feet tall. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).
	Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall lasts until the start of your next turn. Once you use this property, it can't be used again for 1d4 hours.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This flourished mask obscures your eyes and magically stays in place while worn. It once belonged to a wise spiritual leader whose name has been lost to time, but was said to have eschewed personal belongings.
	While wearing the mask and attuned to it, you gain the following benefits:

	• You have blindsight out to a range of 120 feet, and truesight out to a range of 60 feet. You are blind beyond this radius. Despite being blind, you can still see the moon, stars, and sun when they're in the sky above you.

	• Your Wisdom score changes to 21. This property has no effect on you if your Wisdom is already 21 or higher without the mask.

	• You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks.

	• You can spend 3 ki points as an action to cast the spirit guardians spell (save DC 16).

	• You can use an action to spend 2 ki points to cast the calm emotions spell (save DC 16). Alternatively, if you speak to a hostile creature for 1 minute, it must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or become indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward, as if affected by the calm emotions spell (no concentration required). If a creature succeeds on the saving throw in this way, it's immune to the effects of this property for 24 hours.

Curse. This item is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. You can't remove the mask while cursed in this way. You remain cursed until it's ended by a wish spell or similar magic. When you become cursed, your name remains known to only you but becomes lost to the rest of the universe, at the GM's discretion. You must choose a new name. This new name replaces every instance of your lost name throughout history, and becomes the only known name for you among all creatures who once knew your lost name. While cursed, you take 5d10 psychic damage whenever you attempt to speak, write, or otherwise share or communicate your lost name. Regardless of how you attempt to share the lost name, it always comes across as your new one.

    <text>The portrait inside this tiny golden locket transforms to depict the creature you love most (living or dead) once you attune to it. The love can be familial, romantic, or otherwise devotional. If your feelings change and you fall in love with a different creature while wearing the locket, the portrait transforms again to reflect your current feelings. While wearing the locket, you're immune to being charmed.

Curse. This locket is cursed, and if the creature you love most is dead while you're attuned to it, the curse is extended to you. Even if the attunement ends or the target of your love changes, the curse remains. While cursed, your dreams are riddled with forlorn whispers and memories from your lost love. If you die while cursed in this way, you must also make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw whenever you're targeted by a spell or other effect that returns you to life. On a failed save, your soul is lost forever as it joins the soul of your lost love. You remain cursed until you're targeted by the greater restoration or remove curse spell, if the creature you love is restored to life, or if a creature casts the dream spell and enters your dreams to dissolve the locket's illusions.

    <text>This plant is commonly thought to be a special kind of clover. However, a luckleaf is a separate, magical species that grows in random locations across the Material Plane and has 5 leaves. While a luckleaf is on your person, you can choose to expend any number of its leaves (no action required). When you do so, you gain a +1 bonus or take a –1 penalty to any roll you make for each expended leaf. This bonus or penalty can't change the total result beyond the highest or lowest number possible for the die you rolled.
	You can wait to use this property until after seeing the total of the roll, but before the GM determines the outcome of it. An expended leaf withers and turns to dust. When the last leaf is expended, the plant becomes a nonmagical stem.

    <text>This dark metal scythe bears a fiendish grin along its blade. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the scythe, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
	When you hit a creature with an attack using this scythe, you can spend 2 or more Hit Dice (maximum 4) to deal extra necrotic damage, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d6 for each Hit Die you spend. If the creature has cast a spell since the end of your last turn, the extra damage dice become d10s, instead of d6s, and that creature loses a total number of spell slot levels equal to the number of Hit Dice you spend. Starting with the highest spell slot level that creature has (up to 4th), subtract each slot level from the total, if possible, before moving on to the next remaining spell slot level.
	Alternatively, while holding the scythe, you can use an action to spend 5 Hit Dice to create a magical barrier around yourself. While the barrier exists, you can't be affected or detected by spells of 5th level or lower unless you choose to be, and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage of saving throws against spells and other magical effects. The barrier remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute, or until you drop or stow the scythe.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

	On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour. If the poisoned creature is a spellcaster, it takes an additional 4d6 psychic damage and can't cast cantrips until this poison ends. In addition, a poisoned spellcaster can only cast spells of 1st level or higher by using a spell slot at least 4 levels higher than the desired slot level, without the added benefits of using the higher spell slot level. For example, a poisoned spellcaster can cast the 2nd-level version of magic missile using a 6th-level spell slot. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much poison and psychic damage and isn't poisoned.

This version of the spell can visually alter a creature's height by up to 5 feet, although the creature's size does not change, and you roll on the table below to determine which random appearance the creature assumes:

Magnificent Pocket Vanity:
d6 | Random Appearance
1 | A hunched-over elderly gnomish woman with graying hair, missing teeth, and wearing a ragged, faded dress. 
2 | An intimidating half-orc man with deep green skin, black hair pulled back in a bun, and battle-worn hide armor.
3 | A regal and androgynous elf with a tan complexion and golden hair wearing fine leathers and a shimmering cape of red and silver.
4 | A dust-covered human boy of no more than 13 years with messy blonde hair wearing a flimsy cap and half-torn overalls. 
5 | A strikingly red tiefling woman with white hair wearing silver plate armor and wielding a polished longsword. 
6 |  A bald, dwarven man with a peg leg and scar-covered face wearing the garb of a well-traveled sailor.

When the last use of the makeup has been used, the vanity and its makeup become nonmagical.

    <text>This chitinous, two-pronged weapon still shudders with predatory instinct, magically biting down on creatures it hits. Once on each of your turns when you hit a Medium or smaller creature with this magic bident with a melee attack, you can force that creature to make a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, the creature is grappled by you and is held in place by the weapon. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from this grapple on a success.
	You can't use the weapon to attack another target while it's grappling a creature in this way, but you can choose to deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature automatically in place of any attack you'd make with it as part of the Attack action, as the weapon's pincers clamp down tightly around the target. You can release a creature from the bident's grapple on your turn (no action required). The weapon releases a creature from its grasp early if you let go of the weapon or are incapacitated.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

While wearing a hawk mask, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls. In addition, you can cast the feather fall spell at will, targeting only yourself.

While wearing a mule mask, your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks and saving throws against being knocked prone.
	In addition, when you hit a Large or smaller creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to force that creature to make a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

    <text>These dark ceramic and gold masks are fashioned after animals that are sacred in certain cultures. Each mask's appearance and properties are based on the sacred beast it represents. While attuned to a mask, you can end your attunement to it and attune to a different one over the course of 1 minute, instead of over the course of one or more short rests.

While wearing a jackal mask, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and immunity to necrotic damage.
	In addition, you can use an action to fire a beam of deathly green magic from your forehead at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property of the mask has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
	A humanoid killed by this necrotic damage rises at the start of your next turn as a mummy under your control. The mummy acts on its own initiative count. On your turn, you can mentally command the mummy if it is within 120 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated (no action required). You decide what action the mummy takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.
	The mummy remains until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until it's reduced to 0 hit points, or until you are no longer attuned to any mask of the sacred beast, causing it to turn to dust. You can only create and control one mummy at a time in this way.

	You remain petrified until you die or are targeted by the greater restoration spell, or until you regain any number of hit points, regaining consciousness and returning to your normal form when you do. While petrified in this way, you don't make death saving throws at the start of each of your turns, although you still suffer failures if you take damage. In addition, critical hits against you while petrified become normal hits, as your stone form offers some protection. When you regain consciousness, you also gain 2d6 + 3 temporary hit points that last for 1 minute as the stone form's lingering protection slowly fades. Once this property has been used 3 times, the ring turns to dust and is destroyed

    <range>30/120</range>
    <text>This crossbow once belonged to a savage gambler. Scoring a critical hit with this magic weapon doesn't double the weapon's damage dice, and when you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with it, the weapon jams and can't be used again until the end of your next turn.
	A target hit with a ranged attack from this crossbow takes 3d4 piercing damage, instead of its normal damage. When you hit with an attack using this weapon and roll three of the same number on its damage dice, use the matching number to determine what effect occurs using the table below. When this happens, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage.

Medzo's Crossbow:
Matching Number | Effect
1 | You can reroll one of the weapon's damage dice, even if it was a matching number. You
must use the new roll.
2 | The next attack roll made against the target before the end of your next turn has advantage. 
3 | The target has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes until the end of your next turn.
4 | If the target is a hostile creature, 30 gp magically appears at your feet.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: martial, hand crossbow

    <text>This short scarlet robe's interior and sleeves hold hundreds of arcane runes that have been embroidered with platinum thread. While wearing the robes, you can change your known Metamagic options whenever you finish a long rest. In addition, you gain the following three Metamagic options to choose from.

Delayed Spell. When you take the Ready action to ready a spell that targets a point within its range, you can spend 3 sorcery points to choose a point you can see within that spell's range. Readying this spell doesn't require concentration, can be released as a reaction within 1 minute, and when the spell is released, it targets the chosen point (even if you can no longer see it) and is cast as though you were in the same space as when you took the Ready action. A spell readied in this way fades and has no effect if it's not released within 1 minute. You can only have one spell readied at a time in this way.

Emergency Spell. When a creature hits you with an attack or you take damage, you can use your reaction and spend 6 sorcery points to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action or bonus action.

Expanded Spell. When you cast a spell that affects an area such as a line, cone, or sphere, you can spend 2 sorcery points to increase its area of affect. A line's length increases by 15 feet, a cone's size increases by 5 feet, a cube's size increases by 5 feet on a side, a sphere's radius increases by 5 feet, and a cylinder's diameter or height increases by 5 feet or 10 feet, respectively (your choice).

	This monocle has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

Spells. While wearing the monocle, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: arcane eye (4 charges), detect thoughts (2 charges), or telepathic bond (5 charges).

Mental Assault. While wearing the monocle, you can use a bonus action to expend 3 of its charges to attempt to break a creature's concentration on a spell. The target must be within 60 feet of you, and you must be able to see it. When you do, make an Intelligence check contested by the target's spellcasting ability check. If you win the contest, the target's concentration on the spell ends.

As a reaction when you reduce a Large or smaller beast or monstrosity of challenge rating 3 or lower to 0 hit points with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to try and capture it instead.

The creature returns to the sword after 1 minute if you're within 100 feet of it, or earlier if you touch the creature with the sword as an action. The creature ceases to be friendly to you and your companions if it's unable to return to the sword, or if you release control of it using a bonus action, or if it takes damage from you or an ally.
	While you're holding the sword and the creature is stored within it or within 30 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's command word and expend 1 or more of its charges to restore 10 hit points to that creature for each charge spent. A captured creature can only regain hit points in this way.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>This pair of dark, open-fingered gauntlets are made from mourningsteel, a metal whose ore has been steeped in the blood of countless fallen creatures. While wearing the gauntlets, you have resistance to necrotic damage. The gauntlets have 12 charges and regain 1d6 + 6 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the gauntlets, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from them using a spell attack bonus of +8: chill touch (no charges, or 1 to cast at 5th level), inflict wounds (1 charge per spell level, up to 5th), or vampiric touch (3 charges). Damage dealt by these spells ignores resistance to necrotic damage.
	In addition, if you spend a charge to cast chill touch from the gauntlets and hit a creature, you can immediately choose to expend additional charges to cast either the inflict wounds or vampiric touch spell from them as part of the action to cast the cantrip. When you do, the cantrip's skeletal hand delivers the spell to the target, instead of requiring you to touch it. If you were already concentrating on the vampiric touch spell when you hit a creature with chill touch in this way (after spending a charge to cast it), you don't need to expend any additional charges to deliver your vampiric touch spell to the target. Necrotic damage dealt by chill touch doesn't count toward the amount dealt by vampiric touch for the purpose of calculating the number of hit points you regain from the spell.

While the candle burns, ghostly hands reach out from the holder as if to warm their hands by the tiny fire.
	If you're holding the lit candle and its holder while attuned to it, will-o'-wisps are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. In addition, you can use an action to cast the blink spell from it. For the duration of the spell, whenever you vanish from your current plane of existence, a will-o'-wisp appears in your space there instead. The will-o'-wisp's turn is immediately after your own, and it obeys your mental commands (no action required by you). The will-o'-wisp vanishes when you return from the Ethereal Plane or when it's reduced to 0 hit points, at which point you return early to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from.
	Once the candle and holder have been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dusk.

    <text>This dark armor has been made from mourningsteel, a metal refined from ore found beneath the battlefields of particularly vicious wars. Steeped in the blood from relentless battles, this metal carries with it a magical aversion to all things holy. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and have resistance to radiant damage. While you wear it, you gain the following benefits:

Death Transference. Whenever you are subjected to necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to take no damage and instead gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dusk.

Spells. You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17) from the armor: bestow curse, divine word, or nondetection. Once the armor has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dusk.

The Battlefield Remembers. You can use an action to touch a weapon, piece of armor, or similar object that's seen blood and battle to recreate the effect of the legend lore spell, using the touched object as the subject of the effect. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Unholy Aura. As a bonus action, you can speak the armor's command word to sur round yourself with an aura of grim blasphemy. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. For the duration, celestials have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and the first time that a celestial moves within 5 feet of you on its turn or starts its turn there, that creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. In addition, once before the aura ends, if you fail a saving throw against an effect from a celestial (such as a solar's Slaying Longbow), you can choose to succeed instead. Once the aura ends, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This war standard is adorned with a tattered, bloodied banner of an army long lost to time. The standard is 6 feet tall and weighs 7 pounds, but can be collapsed down to 3 feet tall or extended up to its full length by using a bonus action. While the banner is on your person, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
	The standard has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the extended standard, you can use an action to speak its command word and plant it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach. While the standard is within your reach, you can use an action to remove it. Alternatively, another creature that can reach the standard can use an action to make a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check, removing it on a success. While the standard remains there, the space becomes difficult terrain.
	As part of the action to plant the standard, you can expend any number of its charges to magically summon one animated armor for each expended charge. When you do, the armors each appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 20 feet of the standard. A summoned armor remains for 1 hour, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until the standard is removed. The armor vanishes when the effect ends.
	The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the animated armors' statistics.

    <text>A hefty blowgun used by the inhabitants of the Murk: a series of deadly swamps whose waters are polluted with an uncanny poison. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magic blowgun, that creature takes an extra 1d4 poison damage. When you roll a 20 on a ranged attack roll made with the blowgun, the target must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. It is incapacitated while poisoned in this way.
	In addition, this blowgun can be wielded as a magic club.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Proficiency: martial, blowgun

    <text>This naturally-sourced armor is interwoven with fibers and caps from a resilient strain of violet fungus that grows when exposed to rejuvenating magic. While wearing this armor, your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and whenever a spell or magical effect causes you to regain hit points, you also gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the number of hit points you recover, up to a maximum of 15 temporary hit points. While you have temporary hit points in this way, you also have resistance to necrotic damage.

Curse. Once you don and attune to this magic armor, you can't doff it unless you die or are targeted by the remove curse spell: a side effect of the violet fungus' magical and parasitic effects. When your attunement to the armor ends, your Constitution score is reduced by 2 (to a minimum score of 1) until 2d6 + 6 days have passed or until you attune to the armor again.

	• You can use an action while wearing the glasses to cast the comprehend languages spell from them. The spell ends early if you remove them.

	• At the start of a long rest, you can place the glasses next to a book or stack of parchment, such as on a desk, to create a spectral copy of yourself. The copy appears after 10 minutes, sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and remains for the duration of the rest or until the glasses are moved or you move more than 30 feet away from them. It can perform light activity within the glasses' space, such as reading, writing, or copying spells into your spellbook, provided it has all the materials necessary to do so. You decide what the copy does at the start of the long rest. The copy can't speak, hear, or see anything outside of its space. When you finish the long rest, you learn any information the copy read or wrote about over the course of the rest.

    <text>This glass orb has a special funnel at its top that traps bad dreams. When you finish a long rest in which you sleep while the orb is on your person, there is a 25 percent chance that the orb is filled with a small amount of dark, swirling smoke: a visual representation of a collected nightmare. The orb can collect 1 nightmare every 24 hours and can hold up to 10 nightmares in this way.
	You can use an action to throw the flask at a point you can see within 30 feet of you, shattering and destroying it upon impact. When the flask shatters, each creature within 20 feet of the point must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be magically put to sleep. If a creature has less than half its hit points left, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage. Each creature that falls asleep is unconscious for up to 1 minute or until it takes any damage other than psychic damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. A creature that's asleep in this way takes 1d10 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns, up to a number of turns equal to the number of nightmares collected by the orb. This psychic damage can't reduce a creature's hit points below 1.
	Alternatively, the orb can be used as a preventative measure against the dream spell. When you're targeted by the dream spell, the caster of the spell must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the caster takes 1d10 psychic damage for each collected nightmare in the flask. The flask then cracks and is destroyed, and the spell fails. On a successful save, the spell takes effect, and the orb isn't destroyed.

Freezing Fog. While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to cast the gaseous form spell from it, targeting only yourself, with the following changes:

	• You take the form of a frigid cloud of fog, creating illusory frost on objects you touch.
	• You can take the Attack action while in this form. When you do, your attacks are unarmed strikes that deal 1d6 cold damage, instead of their normal damage.

	• Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

    <text>This engraved geode has been split apart into two equal halves. A labyrinth is carved into the rock's rough exterior and glows with a faint light.
	While holding one of the halves, you can use an action to speak the geode's command word, "unturned," and turn it over so the flat, gem-encrusted side is pressed against a solid stone, natural metal (such as iron or silver), or earthen surface such as a floor or wall. When you do, the geode becomes magically fixed in place against the surface and projects a 3-foot-spherical map above it, showing the area within 120 feet of it. The map shows all walls, floors, and other surfaces made of either stone, natural metal, or earth within range as translucent outlines and shapes. The map is entirely monochromatic, but shows the general location of any trap or gemstone within its range with a shapeless, red glow.
	The geode remains fixed in place until you speak its command word again using a bonus action, its surface moves, or it's forced to hold more than 100 pounds. A creature can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, moving the geode and causing the map to vanish.
	Once a half has been used in this way, that half can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>Novanite is a strong metal smelt from ore mined in the Astral Plane. Armor made from this metal absorbs more light than normal and gives off a strange, otherworldly aura. Glimmering cosmos can be seen in the armor's reflections at night. You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

Astral Leap. While wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to choose a space you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, you vanish into a planar tear and reappear at the chosen spot at the start of your next turn, remaining in the Astral plane until you do. If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you take 3d6 force damage and appear in the nearest unoccupied space.

This property of the armor can't be used again until 12 hours have passed.
	Disappearing and reappearing in this way creates vacuums and waves as space is pushed and pulled around you. Other creatures within 10 feet of you when you vanish or reappear must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and is pulled up to 10 feet toward the space you left from, or pushed 10 feet away from the space you reappear in. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much force damage and is not pulled or pushed.
	The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

	This star-shaped mithral buckler weighs 2 pounds and bolsters your sense of holy purpose. While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. The center of the shield is ornamented with a durable, glassy lens that can project your holy radiance. You can use a bonus action while holding this shield to cause it to emit bright light from the lens in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to extinguish it or until you drop to 0 hit points.
	Radiant Aura. When you doff this shield or by using an action, you can speak the shield's command word and choose to throw it to a friendly creature (if it has a free hand) or unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see, causing the shield to radiate with your holy resolve and light. The shield's light becomes suffused with divine intention, casting bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet instead of its normal radius. This holy light lasts for 1 minute, and any friendly creature within the bright light gains the effects of your paladin auras. Completely covering the affected shield with an opaque object blocks the light.

    <text>This glass orb has a miniature graveyard inside and has a base made from a hollowed humanoid skull. It's roughly fist-sized and weighs 1 pound. While the orb is on your person, undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you're holding the orb, you can use an action to speak one of its two command words.
	The first command word shunts a Medium or Small humanoid corpse that you can see within 5 feet of you into a special demiplane contained within the orb. A corpse within this demiplane doesn't age, effectively extending the time limit on raising it from the dead. If you shunt a second corpse into the demiplane while another one is there, the first corpse reappears in the space left behind by the new one.
	The second command word duplicates the effect of the animate dead spell, using a corpse stored within the orb's demiplane as the target of the spell. A skeleton or zombie created in this way appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 15 feet of you and turns to dust and is destroyed after either 24 hours have passed or it drops to 0 hit points. If you speak this command word again to create a second skeleton or zombie while the first one remains, the first skeleton or zombie turns to dust and is destroyed when the new one appears.

    <text>This glassy orb is 3 inches in diameter, weighs 1/2 pound, and is wrapped in a golden wire cage. Strange, wispy smoke drifts around inside the orb, creating cloud-like shapes that are almost recognizable as real-life objects.
	While holding the orb, you can use an action to speak its command word, priming the orb and causing the smoke inside to restlessly billow and swirl. You can gently squeeze the primed orb (no action required) to cause it to record that moment in time around you.
	When you do, the glassy sphere becomes perfectly clear over the course of 1 minute and reveals an exact duplicate of the area around you in up to a 30-foot radius as a miniature, illusory diorama inside it. While holding the orb, the scene inside soundlessly replays the next 6 seconds following the diorama's capture. An orb remains primed for 1 minute or until used to capture a diorama. Touching a primed orb of remembrance to one that already has a diorama creates a duplicate of the diorama in the primed orb. Speaking the command word again while shaking the orb causes the diorama inside to disappear into smoke, allowing it to be primed once more.

You can expend 1 of the weapon's charges when you make an attack with it to coat the fired bolt with a unique, self-generating venom.

7 | Static charge builds up on you. Touching or being touched by anything for the next minute causes a sharp shock of electricity to leap between you.
8 | Your skin, hair, and eye colors are inverted. In addition, roll a d12. You grow or shrink a number of inches equal to the result of the die, shrinking by odd numbers or growing by even ones. After 1 minute, your appearance returns to normal.

The drink is incredibly refreshing with notes of lemon, tea, and cherry, and has virtually no alcoholic bite to it. Regardless, due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>The typical Orostead iced tea, a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that creates harmless sensory effects with each sip. When made, a tea has enough for 6 + 1d4 sips before it's used up, instead of a single use. You can take a sip as an action.
	The following Orostead iced tea is a very rare variant with additional properties. It also tastes better.
	When you take a sip of this potion, roll a d8 and consult the table below instead to determine which one of the following benefits you gain. Once you've gained a benefit from the table, you can't gain that same benefit again until you finish a long rest.

Orostead Iced Tea:
d8 | Effect
1 | For 1 hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Strength ability checks and saving throws, as well as attack and damage rolls for weapons that use Strength.
2 | For 1 hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity ability checks and saving throws, as well as attack and damage rolls for weapons that use Dexterity.
3 | You gain 2d10 + 20 temporary hit points.
4 | For 1 hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence ability checks and saving throws. If Intelligence is your spellcasting ability, you also gain a +2 bonus to your spell attack rolls and spell save DC for the duration.
5 | For 1 hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Wisdom ability checks and saving throws. If Wisdom is your spellcasting ability, you also gain a +2 bonus to your spell attack rolls and spell save DC for the duration.
6 | For 1 hour, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma ability checks and saving throws. If Charisma is your spellcasting ability, you also gain a +2 bonus to your spell attack rolls and spell save DC for the duration.
7 | Choose a benefit from the table, even if you've already gained it since you finished your last long rest.
8 | You recover expended spells slots with a combined level that is equal to or less than 8, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. If you don't have any expended spell slots, you can use an action to cast the fireball spell once within the next 8 hours, casting the spell at 6th level and using a spell save DC of 16 when you do.

	The drink is incredibly refreshing with notes of lemon, tea, and cherry, and has virtually no alcoholic bite to it. Regardless, due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.

As an action, you can touch the tip of the shovel to a patch of loose earth within 5 feet of you and speak its command word. When you do, you can magically excavate up to a total of eight contiguous 5-foot cubes of loose, nonmagical earth, starting from where you touched the shovel. It takes 1 minute for these changes to take effect. Any dirt or stone removed in this way is destroyed, leaving behind any loose metals or gemstones within the excavated area. The shovel can only remove up to eight 5-foot cubes of earth in this way each day.

When the bomb explodes, each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes visible if it isn't already, and can't become invisible for 1 minute.

    <text>This slingshot requires two hands to attack and is adorned with coin-like designs. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, when you make a ranged attack with this weapon and use a coin as its ammunition, it deals extra damage on a hit based on the value of the coin you use:

Pennypuncher Slingshot
Coin | Damage Bonus
1cp | +1
1sp | +1d4
1ep | +1d6
1gp | +1d8
1pp | +1d12

Recovering coins fired in this way follows the normal rules for recovering ammunition. Depending on the nature of the battlefield, you may recover more or fewer coins than normal as determined by the GM.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, sling

    <text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic spear. When you make a ranged attack with this spear, you can speak its command word to cause the weapon to soar through the air straight toward the target and magically build momentum. Hit or miss, the spear flies back to your hand immediately after the attack. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet the spear flew before hitting it, up to a maximum of 12d4 extra damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

When you do, you can magically see through the rod and outside the far end as if the rod were a spyglass. While looking through the rod in this way, you can use a bonus action to mentally control the angle of the rod's ends, as well as its length. The rod can grow up to 5 feet long in this way, and returns to its normal size when your remove your eye from it.

	The bow has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack with this bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the arrow to slip partially into the Ethereal Plane. When you do, the target of the attack gains no benefit from cover, including total cover, as long as the cover isn't made of lead or more than 1 foot thick. If you hit, the target takes an extra 3d4 force damage. Any effect that blocks travel through the Ethereal Plane also blocks the arrow.
	Alternatively, you can speak the bow's command word as a bonus action to expend 3 of its charges and fire an arrow at a point you can see within the weapon's normal range. When the arrow hits a solid surface, you vanish from your location and reappear in an unoccupied space nearest to that point.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon.

    <text>This heavy, steel greatsword creates a powerful fan of flames from curious, whirring chambers mounted to the blade. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The sword has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.
	As an action, you can hold the sword out in front of you and speak its command word to expend up to 5 of its charges, causing a jet of flame to erupt from it. When you do, the sword emits a roar that's audible out to 100 feet, and you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 20 feet for each charge you expend.
	You can choose to fail this saving throw, whose DC equals 10 + the number of charges you expend. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Pointing the blade down and expending charges in this way launches you upward instead. If you do and you are not launched, the sword's flames spread out in a 15-foot-radius circle, centered on you.
	The jet of flame spreads out in a 15-foot cone and moves with you if you're pushed. Any creature in the area when the flame first appears or when it moves into the creature's space must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 fire damage, or half as much fire damage on a success. The fire damage increases by 1d6 for each additional charge you expend beyond the first. If you strike an object because of this forced movement, such as a wall or floor, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every charge you expend and are knocked prone. If you strike a creature, you and that creature take the same bludgeoning damage and must each succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 10 + the number of charges you expend) or be knocked prone.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

	While holding the dagger in one hand and a small enough object in another, you can use an action to speak the dagger's command word and twist it in the air as if it were a key. When you do, the object is shunted into a special demiplane, where it remains until you either twist the dagger in the opposite direction on your turn (no action required) or until you're no longer holding the weapon. If you have a free hand, the stored object reappears in it when the object leaves the demiplane. Otherwise, it reappears at your feet. The demiplane can only store one object at a time, which must be no more than 1 foot on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

While wearing the armor, you can expend 1 of its charges (no action required) to activate the cape, transforming it into a pair of insect-like wings for 1 hour. For the duration of the wings, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover.

Beekeeper's Commitment. While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the armor regains all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of 1d3, and gains the following benefit:

Pollinator. While the armor's cape is transformed, it releases a sparkling mist of enchanting pollen. For the duration, any insect or plant creature that targets you with an attack or harmful spell must first make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.

    <text>While wearing this pair of black-and-yellow striped pants, any flower you move within 5 feet of magically blossoms, as if by the druidcraft spell.
	The pants have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the pants, you can use an action to expend 1 of their charges to cast the speak with plants spell from them. This version of the spell only affects plants within the spell's range that have at least one flower on them. When you speak with a plant in this way, you do so by making a combination of somatic gestures and dance-like steps, rather than using your voice. These movements come naturally to you for the duration of the spell and magically convey your message.

Beekeeper's Commitment. While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the pants regain all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of 1d3, and gain the following benefit:

Sting. When you take the Attack action on each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to make a special unarmed strike against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d4 piercing damage from the attack. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this unarmed strike, the target takes an extra 10 poison damage from the attack and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.

    <text>This chitinous mask rests over your ears and can be raised or lowered using an action to sit on top of your head or in front of your eyes. The mask has two large, eye-like lenses that improve your vision and allow you to visualize scents. While wearing the mask over your eyes, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and smell.
	The mask has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the mask over your eyes, you can expend 1 of its charges as an action to cast the animal messenger spell from it, targeting a Tiny insect or similar creature within range, such as a centipede, spider, wasp, or scorpion. When cast in this way, the insect covers about 25 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 12 miles for other insects.

Beekeeper's Commitment. While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the mask regains all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of 1d3, and gains the following benefit:

Bug. When you use the mask to cast the animal messenger spell, you can direct the insect to surreptitiously follow the spell's recipient for the duration instead. When you do, you must also provide the insect with a trigger word or phrase. When the recipient speaks the trigger word or phrase, the insect magically begins to record the following words spoken by the recipient and any other creature it's speaking to. The insect can record up to 25 total words in this way, or up to 6 second's worth of other sounds. Once it has a recording, you hear it in your mind as the insect magically communicates it to you across any distance, provided that you're on the same plane of existence. The message replicates the sound of any recorded creature's voice. The spell then ends, and the insect makes its way back to where you cast the spell.

    <text>This spiked leather collar is adjustable in size and has a buckle on its side in the shape of a bear's head. You can place the collar on a willing Medium or smaller creature using an action. If the creature is a friendly beast companion or a familiar (such as one summoned by the find familiar spell), you can speak the collar's command word as part of this action to create a magical bond between you and the creature. The bond remains until the collar is removed. While the bonded creature is wearing the collar, its hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your character level.
	In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak the collar's command word while you can see the bonded creature within 30 feet of you. When you do, the creature gains the effect of the Enlarge option from the enlarge/reduce spell (no concentration required).
	Alternatively, if you drop to 0 hit points while the bonded creature is within 30 feet of you, it can use its reaction to gain the spell's effect instead. Once this property of the collar has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.
	If the beast or familiar wearing the collar is a transformed humanoid or other creature, such as by the polymorph spell or similar magic, the bond fails when you speak the command word and the collar has no effect. If the bonded creature is a familiar summoned by the find familiar spell, the collar and familiar disappear into a pocket dimension together whenever you temporarily dismiss it. If the bonded familiar is dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the collar behind. A creature can only gain the benefits of one magical collar at a time.

    <text>This halberd is a long-lost prototype from a now-dissolved military research facility. Electricity magically courses through the weapon along specially channeled grooves in its hollow haft. When you hit with an attack using this halberd, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.
	This halberd has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. While the weapon has at least 1 charge, you can use an action to load a crossbow bolt into its haft toward the bottom of the weapon. Powerful magnetic forces inside the hollow weapon stabilize the bolt and charge it with electricity. When you take the Attack action while holding this loaded weapon, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to make a special ranged attack with it by leveling and firing the halberd as if it were a crossbow. When you do, you don't make an attack roll for the attack, and the bolt is magically launched forward from the weapon in a 1-foot-wide line that's 10 feet long, plus an extra 10 feet for each charge you expend. Each creature in the line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage, plus 1d6 lightning damage for each charge you expend. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much piercing and lightning damage. After the attack, the bolt is destroyed.
	If you expend the halberd's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the weapon becomes overcharged and splinters into an explosion of shrapnel, destroying the halberd. Each creature within 10 feet of the weapon must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This ring grows and shrinks to fit its wearer, but always seems slightly large for the finger it's on. The ring has an extradimensional space inside it dedicated to carrying armor. You can magically bind one set of unworn light, medium, or heavy armor to this extradimensional space over the course of 1 hour by resting the ring on top of the armor. Only one suit of armor can be bound to the ring's extradimensional space. Binding a second suit breaks the bond with the first one, causing it to be forced from the extradimensional space and appear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the ring. While wearing the ring, you're considered to be within 100 feet of any armor stored inside its extradimensional space.
	While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word and touch a suit of bound armor, even if you're wearing it, to shunt it into the ring's extradimensional space. Speaking the command word again while the armor is in this extradimensional space causes you to magically don the armor, adjusting to fit you as needed, or causes it to appear at your feet (your choice). If you're already wearing a suit of armor when you don one in this way, the bound armor appears at your feet instead. If the armor would magically prevent you from doffing it, this property of the ring has no effect.
	You can create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect when you don or doff a suit of armor with the ring in this way, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
	When found, the ring has a 50 percent chance to have a set of bound armor in its extradimensional space. The GM can choose a suit of bound armor from the following table or roll a d12 to determine it randomly.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This quiver has a lid with 5 holes in it and has depictions of the Elemental Planes on its side. It has 4 buttons along its top that correspond to each of the four elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.

Elemental Ammunition. The quiver can have up to 5 arrows or bolts on display at a time, which appear through the holes in its lid. You can press one of the quiver's buttons using a bonus action to cause it to create and display 1 elemental arrow or bolt. The type of arrow or bolt depends on the button you press. The quiver can produce up to 5 of each type of ammunition in this way each day.
	Any arrow or bolt created by this quiver is magical and has the following properties based on its element. The ammunition is only magical for you, and any arrow or bolt removed from the quiver loses its magic at the end of the turn.

Air Ammunition. This ammunition is weightless and whistles softly as it moves. This piece of ammunition can be fired at its long range without disadvantage and deals an extra 1d6 thunder damage to any target it hits. In addition, any magical atmospheric effect that the arrow passes through cast at 3rd level or lower, such as a fog cloud or stinking cloud, is dispelled.

Earth Ammunition. This ammunition carries an uncanny force behind it and turns to stone at its end. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

Fire Ammunition. This ammunition has tongues of fire licking up its side and spews embers at the slightest movement. When shot, it erupts into a plume of white-hot flame. This piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. Hit or miss, the ammunition explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage.

Water Ammunition. This ammunition has a silky texture and glitters with watery reflections. A ranged attack made with this ammunition ignores the normal penalties of underwater fighting and deals an extra 2d6 piercing damage to any target it hits, or 3d6 piercing damage if the target is made of fire. In addition, any nonmagical flames within 10 feet of this ammunition's point of impact are extinguished when it hits.

Paraelemental Ammunition. You can press two compatible elemental buttons at the same time as a bonus action to create a paraelemental arrow or bolt: a hybrid piece of ammunition. Water and Air create Ice, Fire and Earth create Magma, Earth and Water create Ooze, and Air and Fire create Smoke. This ammunition appears from a special compartment in the quiver's lid. The quiver can create 1 of each type of paraelemental ammunition each day. A non-compatible combination, such as Fire and Water or Air and Earth, has no effect.

Ice Ammunition. This special piece of frosted ammunition is cold to the touch and casts off snowflakes when it moves. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra 3d6 cold damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. On a success, the target's speed is halved until the end of its next turn. A creature with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw. A paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect ends early if the paralyzed target takes fire damage.

Magma Ammunition. This special piece of glimmering ammunition is warm to the touch and flakes off in sooty pieces. When you hit with a ranged attack using this ammunition, the target takes an extra 3d6 fire damage. Hit or miss, the area in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact becomes unbearably hot until the end of the turn. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion from the sudden flash of heat. A creature with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeeds on the saving throw.

Ooze Ammunition. This special piece of sticky ammunition gives off a faint, alchemical odor. This ammunition creates a unique grease spell (save DC 15) at the point of impact. This version of the spell covers a 20-foot-square area, and any creature that starts its turn prone in the area takes 1d6 acid damage.

Smoke Ammunition. This special piece of black ammunition feels smooth like coal to the touch and releases a faint wisp of smoke. This ammunition duplicates the effect of the fog cloud spell (2nd-level version) at the point of impact, with the exception that this fog is pitch black.

If the target is a shapechanger or undead, this radiant damage is maximized.
	In addition, while holding the war pick, you can use an action to expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast the moonbeam (6th-level version) or sunbeam spell from it (save DC 16). Once this property of the weapon has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. You can use an action to speak the war pick's command word to cause it to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

    <text>This ancient stone axe hilt is intricately carved. At its center is a gap that houses a single, perfect diamond that's magically suspended in place and glows with an uncanny energy. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a wide blade of pure prismatic light to radiate from the axe's head, or make the blade disappear. The axe's blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.
	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals force damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an aberration or undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d12 radiant damage.
	While the blade persists, you can use a bonus action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.
	The light that comes from the diamond at the axe's center and forms the blade can be wrought to create powerful, destructive glyphs. Over the course of 1 minute, you can trace a glyph onto the surface of the axe, starting with the gem at its center, to recreate the effects of the symbol spell (save DC 17) with the following changes:

	• The glyph you create as part of the spell exists on the axe and moves with it.

	• The glyph can only be triggered when you hit a creature with the axe. Once that creature makes a saving throw against the glyph's effect, the spell ends.

	• The spell only affects the target that triggered the glyph.

	• Aberrations and undead have disadvantage on the saving throw to resist the spell's effects.

	• Once this property of the axe has been used, it can't be used again until 12 hours have passed.

You can only have one glyph on the axe in this way at a time.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>This brass, battle-scarred glaive was famously wielded by a tyrannical queen. You must have a Strength score of 17 or higher to wield this weapon. The queen's intensity still burns inside this weapon, making its handle always warm to the touch. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits.
	The glaive has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, a magical, illusory crown appears on your head. The crown is brass and has a number of horns equal to the number of charges the weapon has remaining. When you expend 1 or more charges from the glaive, the horns adorning the illusory crown burn away in a shower of embers.
	While holding the glaive, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to impose your will on the creatures around you, using the following commands:

"Cower." When you hit a target with the glaive, you can expend 2 charges to exude an imposing aura of dominance. All hostile creatures within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The target of the attack has disadvantage on this saving throw.

"Execute." Immediately after you make an attack with the glaive as part of the Attack action, you can expend 1 charge to command a willing creature other than you to use its reaction to make one weapon attack. The creature must be able to see and hear you. If the attack hits, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage.

"Survive." As a bonus action, you can expend 1 or more charges to grant a creature other than you a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times the number of charges you expend, plus your Strength modifier. The creature must be able to see and hear you. Alternatively, while holding the glaive, you can expend 2 of its charges at the start of your turn (no action required) to become an unyielding pillar of defense. When you do, your movement speed becomes 0 and you gain the following benefits until the start of your next turn:

	• You gain a +2 bonus to AC.

	• You can use your reaction up to three times, instead of once, before the start of your next turn. You can use no more than one reaction per turn.

	• When a creature within 10 feet of you makes an attack against you or another target, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the glaive against the attacking creature.

	• When you hit a creature with an attack using the glaive, that creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, its speed becomes 0 until the start of its next turn.

Flaw. The Red Queen's burden makes its wielder angry and untrusting. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I can only trust one person. Everyone else is either a subject, a threat, or both." You or your GM determine who you can trust.
	In addition, if you are attuned to the weapon for 24 consecutive hours, your hotheadedness leaves your mind open to weakness and distraction. You are vulnerable to psychic damage and have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks. These effects can be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the weapon.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

	In addition, when you expend a 1st-level spell slot to use your Divine Smite feature on an attack made with this bow, you can choose to not expend the spell slot instead. This property can't be used again until the next dawn

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This set of magic smith's tools from the dwarven Redsmith family includes a stone crucible that's been enchanted with minor transmutation magic. If you are proficient with smith's tools or are a dwarf, you can use an action to speak the tools' command word and lower a nonmagical weapon made of metal into the crucible and hold it there for 10 minutes. At the end of that time, make a DC 10 Strength check using the smith's tools. On a success, the weapon is magically reforged.
	A reforged weapon counts as magical, and when you pull the reforged weapon from the crucible, you can change it into another type of weapon that shares the same properties as the original one. For example, a light hammer could become a handaxe, or a longsword could become a warhammer. These benefits last for 24 hours, at which point the weapon becomes nonmagical once more and returns to its original form.
	Once this property of the tools has been used, it can't be used again for 24 hours. In the meantime, the tools can still be used as magic smith's tools.

    <text>This dwarven smithing hammer has runes running from end to end. When beaten against an anvil, the runes around the hammer glow a bright red and emanate heat, allowing a blacksmith to use the hammer to mold weapons and armor using only the hammer and anvil.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, light hammer

    <text>This roughly forged dagger of goblin make has somehow been enchanted with weak, planar magic. This magic dagger has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the dagger within 5 feet of a creature at least one size larger than you, you can use an action to expend 1 of the dagger's charges to create and slip through a brief, planar tear, reappearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature on the opposite side of it. When you do, you can immediately make one weapon attack with this dagger against that creature. If the attack hits, that creature takes an extra 1d6 force damage and can't take reactions until the end of your turn.
	If using the dagger in this way would cause you to move more than 20 feet, you are shunted out of the planar tear and reappear in your original space instead.
	When this happens, you take 4d6 force damage, and the action is wasted.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>This dark, wooden staff is actually a two-sided sheath for a pair of equally dark shortswords. While holding the staff with two hands, you can use a bonus action to twist the staff to sheath or unsheath the two swords from it. When unsheathing the swords, the wooden sheath is shunted into a special extradimensional space until you decide to sheath the swords again, at which point it magically reappears between the swords.
	The weapon has the following properties depending on whether the swords are sheathed as a quarterstaff or unsheathed as a pair of shortswords.

Quarterstaff. While wielded as a quarterstaff, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse property. While holding it, you can use a bonus action to speak the staff's command word to create a spatial rift around you that lasts as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. For the duration of the rift, other creatures within 15 feet of you must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot they move. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Shortswords. These magic shortswords have the thrown property with a normal range of 15 feet and a long range of 30 feet. Hit or miss, the shortsword vanishes in a mirage-like distortion and immediately reappears in your hand after the attack. When you hit with a ranged attack using one of the swords, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of the target. When you do, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against that target before the end of your next turn. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until 1 hour has passed.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: simple, quarterstaff

    <text>This magic ring is made of solid mercury that bubbles and flows freely around your finger whenever you cast a spell. While wearing the ring, you gain the following benefits:

Shift Spell. When a spell you are casting fails because of a counterspell cast by another creature, you can spend 3 sorcery points as a reaction to immediately cast a different spell of the same level or lower without expending another spell slot. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
	To be eligible, the new spell must have the same casting time as the first one and can't consume any material components.

Spell Surge. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to cast a spell no higher than 5th level that has a casting time of 1 action, even if you've already used your action to cast a spell on this turn. When you do, you can't move or take actions until after your next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over you. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>This intricate ring has various flowing designs that are both entropic and patterned in nature. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to create an area of gravitational force that extends from you in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder. The area moves with you and remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 10 minutes. You have a semblance of control of the gravity within this cylinder. A friendly creature other than you spends 1 foot of movement for every 2 feet it moves within the area, while hostile creatures must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved instead.
	For the duration, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to try and overwhelm a creature that you can see within the cylinder with a wave of intense gravity. Such a creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 2d10 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. In addition, you can use a bonus action on your turn to pull or push any water within the area up to 20 feet toward you or away from you, up to the outside of the cylinder. This effect lasts for the duration of the cylinder or until you use a bonus action to change the water's direction or end the effect.
	Once the ring has been used to create an area of gravitational force, it can't do so again until the next dusk. Alternatively, you can use an action to speak the ring's command word to cast the reverse gravity spell (spell DC 16) from it. Once the ring has been used in this way, it loses this property.

When you do, your illusory double is hit by the attack, instead of you, and you and the double can immediately move up to your remaining speed without provoking opportunity attacks. This version of the spell doesn't require concentration, but lasts until the end of your next turn, instead of 1 hour. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.

	In addition, when you cast the ritual version of a spell, you can use the ring as a material component of the spell in addition to its normal requirements. When you do, the ritual version of the spell's total casting time is reduced by 5 minutes. Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>This ring has a loose outer layer that's covered with illustrations of a person caught in various stages of running. If you spin the outer layer, the person appears to animate and run.
	If you aren't surprised while wearing this ring, you can use your reaction when you roll for initiative to spin the ring and speak its command word. You use this reaction after you know the initiative order, if the GM shares it with you, but before any creature takes its turn. Choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you that also rolled for initiative. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or swap the total of its initiative roll with yours. A willing creature can choose to fail this saving throw. Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

If the GM doesn't share the initiative order with you, you can choose up to three creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you as part of this reaction. You immediately learn whether each of those creatures acts before or after you in the initiative order. Afterward, choose one of those creatures to make the saving throw as normal.

In addition, you can concentrate on spells while raging, but have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain your concentration on them when you take damage.

	If you're concentrating on a spell of 3rd level or lower and wearing the ring, you can choose to cast another spell of 3rd level or lower that also requires concentration without losing concentration on the first one. While concentrating on two spells in this way, make a Constitution saving throw for each spell as normal whenever you take damage to maintain your concentration. When you do, roll the d20 for each spell's saving throw in the order in which you cast them. You are vulnerable to psychic damage while concentrating on two spells in this way.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These rings typically come in pairs but have been known to come in sets of up to four. Each ring is magically connected and can be attuned to by a different creature. While wearing one of the rings, you can use the following property even if you aren't attuned to it: When another creature that you can see who is also wearing one of the rings drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to cause that creature to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once this property of the rings has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
	If you find an additional ring of the true companions, you can add it to an existing set by holding all of the rings together for 1 minute. A ring can only be a part of one set at a time, and is removed from a set if it's more than 1 mile away from the other rings for 24 consecutive hours.
	If you are the only creature attuned to one of the rings, it gains 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action expend 1 of its charges to cast the cure wounds spell (spellcasting modifier +3). If the target of the spell is another creature wearing one of the rings, the spell's range increases to 30 feet.
	If additional creatures are attuned to rings from the set, the rings' collective strength grows and they share a pool of charges instead. For each attuned creature after the first, the rings gain an extra 2 charges and regain another 2 expended charges daily at dawn. The rings can share a maximum of 9 charges in this way (1d3 + 6). The following properties are shared among all attuned creatures who are also wearing one of the rings from the set. The effects are cumulative and are determined by the number of attuned wearers:

2 attuned wearers: When you use the rings to cast cure wounds on another wearer, you can choose to cast it using a bonus action instead, but can only cast it once on the same turn.

3 attuned wearers: When you use the rings to cast cure wounds on another wearer, its range increases to 60 feet, and you can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend, up to 4th level.

4 or more attuned wearers: When you use the rings to cast cure wounds on another wearer, you also gain 1d4 + 1 temporary hit points for each charge you spend.

The bolt creates a magical vacuum in a 20-foot-radius circle centered on that point, causing strange, spectral tides to pull creatures toward it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. A creature is pulled up to 15 feet toward the point on a failed save, or only 5 feet on a successful one. Until the start of your next turn, the area becomes difficult terrain.
	At the start of your next turn, the point erupts, sending out a powerful wave of water in a 20-foot radius that extinguishes all nonmagical flames within the area. The water then vanishes. Any creature in the area when the point erupts must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw.
	On a failure, a creature takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Proficiency: martial, heavy crossbow

	When you take the Attack action while holding this whip, you can use it to attack a target that's up to 5 feet outside your normal reach with the weapon. On a hit, the weapon's damage die changes to a d6 and deals thunder damage instead of slashing damage. Hit or miss, it emits the sound of a roaring lion audible out to 100 feet.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

While holding the rod, you can use your reaction when another creature hits you with a melee attack to expend 1 of the rod's charges to increase your AC by 1d6 for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. If the attack misses you as a result of using this property, the attacker must also make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 lightning damage and 1d10 thunder damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The connection lasts as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), or until the other creature chooses to close it or moves farther than 120 feet away from you. For the duration, you can communicate with it telepathically. In addition, as part of the action to open this connection or as an action on a subsequent turn while it remains open, you can choose to see through the creature's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the creature has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
	If the creature is unwilling, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have the mental connection be established anyway. The creature is aware of the effect when it makes the saving throw. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the connection is severed, and the effect ends. Once the rod has been used on an unwilling creature in this way, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

    <text>This hollow rod has a hole at its end and four sections that each magically hold up to 10 gallons of water. Each hollow section is capped with a ring of glass, allowing you to see inside the rod and know how much water is stored within it. The rod weighs 3 pounds, regardless of how much water is stored inside.
	While holding the open end of the rod underwater, you can speak its first command word as an action to cause it to begin absorbing water for the next minute. The rod can only absorb water. If the rod is submerged in this way for the full duration, it absorbs 10 gallons of water.
	The rod can hold up to 40 gallons at any time in this way, and can absorb up to 100 each day. While holding the rod, you can use an action to speak its second or third command words. When you speak the second command word, you cast the create or destroy water spell (Create Water only) from the rod.
	You can cast the spell at up to 4th level in this way. Each gallon of water you create as part of the spell is drawn from the pool of water within the rod. If you cast this spell from the rod and cause the water to fall as rain, the spell consumes 10 gallons of water for each of the spell's slot levels.
	Speaking the third command word causes 10 or more gallons of water to erupt from the rod in a torrent of water, up to the maximum amount remaining within the rod. This water is drawn from the pool of water within the rod. The water is shot in a line 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. Any creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 gallons of water used from the rod and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed.

    <weight>2</weight>
    <text>This sturdy antler rod is capped on either end with a plush leather handle. You can twist the two handles in opposite directions as an action, releasing an unearthly roar audible out to 100 feet and causing the rod to magically split apart and form a powerful, two-wheeled vehicle made of wood, with the rod's handles at its front.
	You can twist the handles again as an action to return the vehicle to its rod form. The vehicle can appear underneath you, with you standing astride it, or in an empty space within 5 feet of you (your choice). The vehicle is a Medium magical object, called a magicycle, and has the following properties:

	• The vehicle has AC 14, 40 hit points, and a speed of 60 feet. While moving, its AC becomes 17. When underwater, it ceases to function and immediately reverts to its rod form.

	• The vehicle weighs 200 pounds. If it falls prone, it can't right itself until a creature within reach pulls it upright as an action.

	• One Small or Medium creature drives and steers the vehicle. It can carry up to 300 pounds and comfortably fits either one Medium creature or two smaller ones.

	• If the vehicle moves in a straight line for 600 feet, its speed increases to 100 feet until the next time it makes a significant turn or until it slows down or comes to a stop.

	• For every uninterrupted period of 8 hours that the vehicle is in its rod form or goes unmoved, it regains 1d8 hit points. If it drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its rod form and can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

	• When you make a Dexterity saving throw while riding the vehicle, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. On a successful save, you can drive the vehicle up to 20 feet as part of the reaction. If moving in this way causes you to no longer be in the triggering effect's area, such as an ancient red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell, you instead take no damage, instead of half damage, from the effect. On a failed save, you and the vehicle fall prone.

    <text>This magic weapon is a favorite among infiltrators. Its firing mechanism has no string, unlike other crossbows. Instead, this weapon can only be loaded with rope. As a bonus action, you can load a length of rope into the crossbow. When you do, individual strands from the rope magically latch onto the weapon's limbs and pull the mechanism taut. You can make a ranged attack with the crossbow to fire the rope at a willing creature or an object within range that isn't being worn or carried.
	If it hits, the target takes no damage from the attack but is bound by the rope. If the rope is long enough, it magically wraps around the target in a single loop and securely ties itself, leaving the remaining rope to hang from the knot. If the target is a willing creature, the rope ties itself around the creature's chest or waist as a harness but does not restrain them. If the attack hits an unwilling creature, the rope falls harmlessly to the ground without being tied.
	A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check, releasing a bound object within its reach on a success

	This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d8 fire damage.
	You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.
	The staff has 15 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff erupts into a pillar of flame and is destroyed.
	The flames erupt in a 20-foot-radius cylinder that's 80 feet tall. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Protective Flame. When a creature that you can see hits you with an attack while you're holding the staff, you can use your reaction to expend any number of charges from the staff to reduce the attack's damage against you by an amount equal to 5 times the number of charges you expend. If the attacker is within 5 feet of you, it also takes fire damage equal to the amount of damage that was reduced in this way.

Spells. While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: fire shield (4 charges, warm shield only), fireball (3 or more charges), or scorching ray (2 or more charges). When you cast fireball or scorching ray from the staff in this way, you can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to cast the flame blade spell (4th-level version, no concentration required) from the gauntlets, using either your spellcasting ability or your choice of Strength or Dexterity for the spellcasting ability of the spell when you do.
	While holding the fiery blade, you can use an action to make a ranged spell attack with it instead. When you do, the blade becomes a fiery spear with a range of 30 feet. On a hit, the spear deals 4d6 fire damage. Immediately after the attack, the fiery blade reforms in your hand.

    <text>This miraculous, one-shouldered robe is made from fine fabrics that have been steeped in powerful magic and fastened with an ornate buckle. The sash has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
	When an ally that you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell while you're wearing this robe, you can use your reaction to expend 1 or more of the sash's charges to twist the spell with one of your known Metamagic options, without spending any sorcery points. The number of charges you expend is equal to the number of sorcery points the Metamagic option would normally cost. If using the sash would cause the spell to target a second creature, you choose the new target.
	In addition, when you use a Metamagic option on a spell while wearing this sash, you can change the style, color, and material of the garment and buckle. The sash's weight doesn't change. Regardless of its appearance, the sash can't be anything but a one-shouldered robe.

If a beast or monstrosity with a challenge rating of 2 or lower and an Intelligence of 3 or lower eats a serving of this food from your hand or similar outstretched vessel, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. While charmed, the creature regards you and your companions as friends, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) and Charisma checks made to interact with the creature.
	If the creature takes any damage from you or your companions for the duration, the charm ends early. If the charm lasts for the full duration, the creature remains non-hostile toward you until you threaten it.

	The whip siphons blood from creatures that it hits. Whenever you hit a Small or larger living creature with the whip that is not a construct, ooze, plant, or undead, the bone blade at its end absorbs some of its blood and gains 1 charge. The whip can hold up to 10 charges and loses its charges whenever you finish a short or long rest. While holding the whip, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to convert these charges into healing energy. When you do, the whip loses all its charges and you regain 2 hit points for each charge lost.
	For every 5 charges the whip has, the muscle fibers that hold it together loosen and add 5 feet to the weapon's reach.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

When cast in this way, find the path can only be used to find the route to a temple or other holy site. Once the rod has cast either of these spells in this way, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

	The following scroll of mapping is a very rare variant with additional properties. This map is in color and displays the names of large and small locations, depending on the map's scale, such as the name of the region, street, or nearby shop. In addition, you can use an action to touch the map and ask it where a familiar person or place is that you can name or clearly describe. If the person or place is somewhere that can be shown on the map, an X appears on it at the target's location. If there are multiple targets with the same name or description within the area, multiple marks appear. If the target is a creature that's in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, or can't be detected by divination magic or scrying sensors, the map doesn't display its location. If the target is moving, the X follows its movements for the duration. The marked target remains shown on the map for 10 minutes, after which time the X vanishes.

	Each creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much psychic damage and isn't frightened. At the GM's discretion, non-sentient creatures, such as some constructs, oozes, plants, and undead, are immune to this effect.
	Reading the scroll causes its script to flash and burn away as each word is spoken. Once the scroll has been used, it turns to ash and is destroyed, releasing a final wail as its magic is consumed.

    <text>Using an action to read this scroll, your appearance magically changes to become a jester. At the same time, 8 perfect illusions of jesters that are identical to you appear in random unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of you. When the jesters appear, each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you as if you had cast the enthrall spell (no concentration required).
	Each jester is indistinguishable from you and shares your AC, initiative, speed, and bonuses to saving throws. On your turn, you can mentally command each jester where to move (no action required). You can choose to see through a jester's eyes, hear what it hears, or speak through it in your own voice. A creature with truesight can determine which jester is you.
	The jesters remain as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute. A jester disappears early in a plume of confetti if it takes any damage, if it's more than 120 feet away from you, or if you choose to expend it in order to create one of the following effects:

	• As an action, you can expend 1 or more jesters to cast one of the following spells (save DC 15, no concentration required): charm person (1 jester), color spray (1 jester), confusion (4 jesters), greater invisibility (4 jesters), hideous laughter (1 jester), hypnotic pattern (3 jesters), levitate (2 jesters), or major image (3 jesters). When you cast a spell in this way, you can cause the spell to originate from you or from a jester that you can see.

	• As a bonus action or as a reaction when you take damage, you can expend 1 jester to immediately and imperceptibly teleport, swapping places with it. The jester disappears after it arrives in your original space.

When the last jester disappears, any effects or spells created by the scroll or its jesters end

As an action, you can touch this dagger to a creature you can see within 5 feet of you and speak its command word. When you do, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature from the pool, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.
	When you hit an undead creature with a melee attack using this dagger, you can expend a number of hit points from the pool, up to the maximum amount remaining, as part of the attack. When you do, you deal extra radiant damage to that creature equal to twice the number of hit points you expend in this way.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

While holding the coin, you can use an action to whisper its command word and toss it into a creature's shadow that you can see within 10 feet of you. When you do, the coin magically dissolves and tags the creature's shadow, causing a smoky, pitch-dark copy of the coin to appear in your hand instead.
	While you're within 1000 feet of the tagged creature's shadow, small points of light appear within the dark coin's eyes that look in the shadow's direction. If the dark coin's eyes are looking toward the shadow, you can grasp the coin and use an action to speak its command word again, destroying the coin and immediately teleporting you to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the tagged creature. Alternatively, when you destroy the coin, you can force the tagged creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature teleports to an unoccupied space on solid ground that you can see within 15 feet of you. A creature can choose to fail the saving throw.
	If the tagged creature doesn't have a shadow, such as if it becomes invisible, the dark coin's eyes disappear until the creature's shadow reappears. The dark coin remains for 24 hours or until you destroy it. If the dark coin lasts for its full duration, there is a 50 percent chance that the normal coin reappears and replaces it. If the coin doesn't reappear at the end of the duration, it's destroyed.

	In addition, this armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and when you attempt to hide in areas of dim light or darkness while wearing it, you gain a +5 bonus to the roll.

Shadow Shift. While in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use an action to turn invisible. You remain invisible for up to 10 minutes or until you use a bonus action to become visible again. You become visible early if you enter an area of bright light or if you attack or cast a spell. While you're invisible in this way, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant, and you can use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. In addition, while you're invisible in this way, you can't be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors against your will.

Once this property of the armor has been used, it shouldn't be used again until the next dusk. Each time it is used again before then, you must expend either 6 Hit Dice, rolling each one and taking force damage equal to the total rolled, or suffer one level of exhaustion (your choice). Force damage taken in this way ignores resistance and immunity.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

    <text>The typical shifter's shine, a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that causes your face to appear more glamorous. For 1 hour after drinking this potion, your skin's complexion clears, appears healthier, and grows more taut. Your face, while largely unchanged, is distinctly more attractive and exudes a weak aura of enchantment magic. When you make a Charisma check while under the effects of this potion, you can choose to forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die.
	Once you use this property, you can't use it again for the remainder of the potion's duration. The potion is a rich honey color and swirls lazily around, regardless of how it's handled. It can be found in any sort of vessel, though it is usually found in glass jars. The eye of a shapeshifter drifts along the potion's bottom, making it a daunting beverage for the average taverngoer to order.
	It has an extremely strong alcoholic taste with a hint of caramel. Due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage. The following shifter's shine is an uncommon variant with additional properties. It also tastes better. When you drink this potion, you gain the effects of the alter self spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action.

    <text>Tiny specks of starlight gleam from the dark surface of this magic longbow at night. The bow is strung with an invisible string that appears only when it's drawn.
	When pulled, the string emits a soft yellow glow as motes of starlight appear and float around the bow's frame. Drawing the bow without first nocking an arrow creates a magic arrow of pure starlight in its place and intensifies the bow's glow. The starlit arrow shines bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon when you use a starlit arrow, which deals radiant damage instead of piercing damage. Hit or miss, the starlit arrow disappears immediately after the attack.

Falling Stars. As an action, you can speak the bow's command word and fire a starlit arrow into the air above you, choosing a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The arrow immediately vanishes and creates a shower of tiny, magical stars that fall and land in a 30-foot-radius circle on the ground centered on the point you chose. Each creature of your choice within the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d6 radiant damage and 3d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, as a shower of magical stars slam into the ground around them. This property can't be used again until the next dusk.
	In addition, when you use a starlit arrow and roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, a tiny magical star appears and strikes the target. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 radiant damage and 1d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after a falling star hits the ground or a target, it disappears.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Proficiency: martial, longbow

    <text>This stony staff has been carved into the shape of a castle tower. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties, which use your spell save DC and spell attack bonus, and regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20.
	On a 1, a the staff crumbles into rubble and is destroyed.

Battering Strike. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. When you hit with a melee attack using this staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the target to take an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it's also pushed 5 feet away from you. In addition, when you attack an object with the staff and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

Fire Pot. While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast the grease spell from it. You can increase the size of the square covered by the spell by 5 feet for each additional charge you expend in this way (up to a 20-foot square). When you expend 2 or more charges to cast the spell in this way, creatures also take 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Trebuchet. While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 3 charges to magically create and fling a boulder at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Any target within 5 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage, and if it's Medium or smaller, it is also pushed 10 feet away from the point. On a successful save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed. Maximize the bludgeoning damage dice against any object or structure hit by the boulder. After it lands, the boulder disappears.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

	In addition, when a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack while you're wearing this armor, you can use your reaction to speak its command word. When you do, a pair of ghostly eagle wings appear from the back of the armor. The wings beat the air around you and push you back up to 10 feet away from the attacking creature, without provoking opportunity attacks. In addition, the sudden movement takes you out of harms way, reducing the damage you take from the triggering attack by 2d6.

Attacking a target within 5 feet of you with this weapon doesn't impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
	If you are attuned to Sir Varion's shield, you can wield this weapon with one hand, instead of two, while also holding the shield.

Special: You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, you can speak its command word to create a magical chain that extends from the spear to a point on the ground within 5 feet of you.
	When you do, the spear remains lodged in the target. Until the spear is dislodged, that target can't move farther away from the point, and at the end of each of its turns, the target is pulled up to 10 feet closer to the point. An object that weighs more than 4,000 pounds can't be pulled in this way. The spear is dislodged from the target after 1 minute, or when a creature uses its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, dislodging the spear from itself or another target within its reach on a success. When the spear is dislodged, it deals 2d8 piercing damage to the target it was lodged in and is immediately pulled back to the point. The magical chain then disappears. You can dislodge the spear on your turn by speaking its command word again as a bonus action.
	Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

In addition, the shield has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

If you land on the ground while falling in this way, you take no damage from falling. You can't Dash while using the shield to fly, and this flying speed can't be increased in any way. You can use the shield to gain altitude when flying in this way, but must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot you fly upward.

	• You summon a torrent of wind beneath your feet, propelling you upward. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover for 10 minutes.

	When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magic weapon, it takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage. In addition, when you roll a 20 on a ranged attack roll made with this bow against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. On a success, a creature takes an extra 6d8 radiant damage from the hit instead. A creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw if it is good-aligned or has legendary actions.

For the purposes of this item, this includes flying snakes, poisonous snakes, and constrictor snakes, although swarms and giant versions of such creatures have a 50 percent chance of being indifferent to you instead.
	You can use an action to play the flute. While you continue to play the flute each round as an action, any snake that comes within 30 feet of you and isn't under another creature's control must make a Wisdom check contested by your Charisma check. If you lose the contest, the snake behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the flute's music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the snake is swayed by the flute's music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the instrument. A friendly snake obeys your mental commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly snake, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly snake starts its turn and can't hear the flute's music, your control over that snake ends, and the snake behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the flute's music for the next 24 hours. Your control over a snake ends early if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you dies while you're wearing this necklace, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the pendant's charges and speak its command word. When you do, that creature's soul becomes trapped in the pendant for 24 hours or until you use this property of the pendant again as a reaction or you choose to release it as a bonus action on your turn. A nonliving creature or creature without a soul, such as a construct or undead, is immune to this effect. While a soul is trapped in the pendant, you gain a +2 bonus to Wisdom ability checks and Wisdom saving throws while you're wearing it.
	In addition, you can use an action to telepathically ask the soul a question, as if by the speak with dead spell, regardless of what the form of its physical body was. Once a soul has been asked 3 questions in this way, it's released from the pendant.
	While a creature's soul is trapped in the pendant, its body is under the effect of the gentle repose spell. If the creature is returned to life while you have its spirit trapped in this way, the spirit is released from the pendant and returned to its body.

    <text>This brass weapon was forged in the heart of the Elemental Plane of Fire. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the scythe, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing soul-rending flames to erupt from the holes in the blade. These flames are harmless to you and shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the scythe.
	While the scythe is ablaze, it deals an extra 3d4 fire damage to any target it hits. This damage ignores fire resistance and immunity, and it becomes necrotic damage when it hits a creature with the Fire Absorption trait.
	In addition, when you score a critical hit with this weapon against a creature that is not a construct or undead, the target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d4 necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much necrotic damage and isn't stunned.
	When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, its body and soul are immolated and destroyed unless it is a construct or undead. A creature whose body and soul have been destroyed by the soul-searing scythe can be restored to life only by a wish spell or divine intervention.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, halberd

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This unassuming leather satchel is embroidered with a floral pattern and is connected to a strange garden on a special demiplane. The garden produces 4 magical seeds daily at dawn, which automatically appear at the bottom of the bag each day. When you open the bag to retrieve the seeds for the first time each day, roll 4d6 and consult the table below to determine the nature of each seed. Any unused seeds turn to dust and are destroyed daily at dawn when the bag produces a new batch of seeds.

Sovereignseed Satchel:
d6 | Seed
1 | Binding Bur: You can throw this jagged bur as if it were a dart or use it as a sling bullet. A Large or smaller creature hit by the bur must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it for 1 minute, as the bur rapidly grows to form a series of entangling plants around it. A creature restrained in this way can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success. The bur withers and is destroyed once a creature succeeds on the saving throw or is no longer restrained by it. 
2 | Bouncing Bloom: You can use an action to plant this seed in the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach. When you do, a 5-foot-radius flower immediately grows in the space. A creature that jumps from the flower is propelled three times the normal distance, up to the creature's remaining movement, without the need for a running start. The flower withers away and is destroyed after 10 minutes or after it's been used to propel a creature in this way ten times.
3 | Cloaking Cotton: You can use an action to hurl this boll into the air at a point within 5 feet of you. When you do, the boll erupts into an opaque cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere, centered on that point. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The sphere does not move with you. The cloud remains for 1 minute, until it's dispersed by a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour), or until 5 or more fire damage is dealt to a target within the area.
4 | Fiddle-Ferry Fig: You can use an action to plant this seed in the ground or place it in a body of water in an unoccupied space within your reach. When you do, the seed immediately grows into a single, large leaf. A creature can break the leaf off its stem using an action. The leaf is 10 feet long and 5 feet across and can support up to 300 pounds. Creatures standing or sitting on the leaf while it's falling descend at a rate of 60 feet per round, or are supported by the leaf when floating in the water. If the leaf is carrying more than 300 pounds, it immediately falls or sinks as normal. After 1 hour, the leaf and stem wither away and are destroyed.
5 | Rose of Radiance"." While held, this seed emits a warm glow, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Alternatively, you can use an action to plant the seed in the ground at a point within your reach. When you do, a single, golden rose grows at the start of your next turn that sheds light twice as far as the seed. The effect lasts for 8 hours or until the flower is moved or destroyed.
6 | Spanning Sprout: You can use an action to plant this seed in the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach. When you do, a bridge made of twisting vines grows horizontally in a line that's 5 feet wide and up to 30 feet long in a direction of your choice. The vines are sturdy and can support up to 500 pounds at a time, provided that both ends of the bridge connect to a solid surface, such as a point on the ground or a wall. The bridge withers away and is destroyed after 1 hour, or if it takes 15 slashing or fire damage (AC 10).

    <range>150/600</range>
    <text>This richly polished wooden longbow is ornamented with a silver trim and bowstring. Even if you aren't attuned to the bow, it creates a special arcane arrow when you draw it back without nocking one. When you fire the bow using one of these arcane arrows, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals force damage instead of piercing damage.
	If you're attuned to the bow, you are proficient with it and can use it as a spellcasting focus. While holding the weapon, you gain a +3 bonus to any ranged spell attack you make, as the spell is launched through the bow. When you do, you perform any somatic component for the spell by drawing the bow. In addition, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that has a range of 5 feet or greater, its range increases by 30 feet.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>This item appears to be a shortsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to activate the sword, causing a blade of pure energy to spring into existence. The sword remains activated for 8 hours, or until you deactivate it early using an action. Once you activate the sword in this way, you can use it as a spellcasting focus, and you are proficient with the spellsword for the duration.
	You can use your spellcasting ability, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for your attack and damage rolls using this weapon, which deals force damage instead of piercing damage. If you activate the sword using a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, its damage die becomes a d8, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If you use a 5th-level slot or higher, its damage die becomes a d10, and the bonus increases to +2 instead.
	When you deactivate the weapon early using an action, the remaining magic stored within the blade erupts into a wave of energy. Each creature in a 10-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the sword was activated using a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, the force damage becomes 4d8, or 5d10 if it was activated with a 5th-level slot or higher.
	The blade emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, and disappears if the sword is no longer activated or if you let go of the weapon. While holding the activated sword, you can use a bonus action to cause the blade to vanish or reappear.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This writer's hand brace allows you to prepare four extra spells from your spellbook whenever you finish a long rest. The spells can be no higher than 5th level and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When you do, the prepared spells appear on the skin of your arm as abstract spell tattoos that represent them. You can prepare the same spell multiple times in this way, taking the necessary time in order to do so, to create multiple copies of the same spell tattoo.
	As an action, you can touch a willing creature and speak the brace's command word to transfer one of your spell tattoos to it, causing the spell tattoo to disappear from your arm and appear on the creature instead. You can only have one tattoo transferred in this way at a time. Transferring a second spell tattoo causes the first one to disappear.
	A spellcaster with a spell tattoo can expend a spell slot of the tattooed spell's level or higher, using its spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability to do so. Once the spell is cast, its tattoo disappears. Any spell tattoos created by the brace disappear when you finish a long rest or remove the brace.

    <text>This dark metal blade can slip between a person and their spirit to sever their connection to one another. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals slashing damage instead of piercing damage.
	While holding this weapon, you can use an action to cast the etherealness spell from it with the following changes:

	• While on the Ethereal Plane, you can attack targets that you can see on the plane you originated from with the spirit cleaver. These attacks are made with advantage. If a target has 75 hit points or fewer after taking Sneak Attack damage in this way and isn't a construct or undead, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.

	• The spell has a duration of 1 minute, but ends early if you attack a creature on the plane you originated from with the spirit cleaver. Once this property of the weapon has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

When you make an attack with this weapon, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
	You must use the same modifier for both rolls. While holding the sword, you can use a bonus action to cast the spiritual weapon spell from it (spell attack bonus +7, +4 spellcasting ability modifier), creating a spiritual duplicate of the scimitar in the air within range. Once this property of the scimitar has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>When you drop to 0 hit points while wearing this armor, your spirit leaves your body and appears as a floating, ghostly version of yourself. The spirit remains there for 1 minute or until you regain consciousness, at which point the spirit returns to your body. For the duration, you don't suffer a death saving throw failure as a result of taking damage, and you can only die from damage if the total damage you take on a turn equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. You still make death saving throws at the start of each of your turns while in this state; however, the number you must roll to succeed on a death saving throw increases by 1 for every 5 feet away from your physical body your spirit is at the start of each of your turns. Your spirit is tethered to your physical body and can't be farther than 30 feet away from it at any time.
	The spirit has your senses, a flying speed of 30 feet, and can hover. On your turn, it can only move and take the Help action. The spirit is immune to all damage and is incorporeal, but an effect that turns undead will automatically send your spirit back to your physical body and end the effect early. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>The protective panels that adorn this splint armor are made from carefully molded pieces of ironleaf lumber, a wood renowned for its remarkable durability. Even if you aren't attuned to the armor, you gain the following benefits:
	While you're wearing this armor, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. In addition, the first time each day you're struck by a critical hit, the armor's panels splinter into countless shards of painful, wooden shrapnel. Other creatures within 10 feet of you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this happens, the armor's wooden panels are cracked until the following dawn, at which point they magically regrow. Until the panels regrow, the armor can't be splintered again and suffers a –2 penalty to the AC it offers. The panels can't be repaired by magical or mundane means, but a plant growth spell can cause the panels to regrow early once before each dawn.
	If you're attuned to this armor, you're considered proficient with it, and you don't suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make as a result of wearing it. In addition, creatures hit by the armor's shrapnel when it splinters take 5d8 piercing damage, instead of 3d8, and you can choose which creatures in the area are affected by it when it happens.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

If the wearer has a Strength score lower than 15, their speed is reduced by 10 feet.

    <text>This tall decanter is filled with water from a miraculous oasis in the H'rethi Desert and is stoppered with a small, overgrown planter. You can pour the water out of the bottle on top of the planter as an action to create a magical oasis that fills up to a 100-foot-square space over the course of 10 minutes. The oasis has a pond filled with clean water and exotic, fruit-bearing trees that can nourish up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The area within the oasis is always under the effects of the alarm spell.
	A swarm of poisonous snakes appears to defend the oasis for each creature that sets off the alarm (maximum of 3), whose rattling tails act as the audible alarm.
	The swarms are friendly to you and your companions, but don't obey verbal commands. Roll initiative for the summoned swarms as a group, which have their own turns. A swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when there are no more hostile creatures within the oasis.
	The oasis remains for 24 hours or until dispelled by a dispel magic spell cast at 5th level or higher. The atmosphere within the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside the oasis. A friendly creature within the oasis can't be frightened and regains an extra 1d4 Hit Dice when it finishes a long rest.
	Drinking the water in the bottle has no effect, but tastes refreshing.

    <text>This staff has a perfect cube of blue crystal at its top that slowly drips with a viscous ooze. The staff has 10 charges. As an action, you can tap the head of the staff on the ground and expend 1 or more of its charges to create a 5-foot cube of a mysterious, gelatinous material for each expended charge. Each cube appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or adjacent to another cube you create as part of this action. The cubes are translucent objects that have AC 10, 20 hit points, and resistance to acid damage. Creating a cube in a space smaller than 5 feet across causes the cube to squeeze and fit the space. A cube remains for 1 minute or until it's reduced to 0 hit points, after which it dissolves into a puddle of slime and vanishes.
	You can climb or walk on the cubes. However, their sticky surfaces are considered difficult terrain.
	The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the gem on top of the staff shatters and is destroyed, creating a gelatinous cube in its place that's hostile toward you. When this happens, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

While the staff is within 5 feet of you, you can use an action to immediately fall asleep, but otherwise can't be put to sleep by magical means. While attuned to the staff, you regain 1 extra Hit Die whenever you finish a long rest.
	In addition, while holding the staff, you can use an action to summon a flock of spectral sheep. The sheep run in a line 20 feet long and 10 feet wide originating from you before disappearing. Each creature of your choice in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw and has 20 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it also falls asleep.
	Undead and creatures immune to being charmed can't be put to sleep in this way.

A creature within reach of the staff can use an action to eat one of the grapes, which duplicates the effect of eating a berry from the goodberry spell. 1d10 eaten grapes regrow on the clutch daily at dawn.
	While holding the staff, you can use an action to cast the entangle spell from it (save DC 13), causing twisting grapevines to sprout from the ground in the target area.

	When you hit a creature with this weapon and roll the maximum number possible on the weapon's damage die, the crystals rapidly grow and increase the weapon's damage die by one size, up to a d12. For example, when you roll an 8 on the weapon's normal d8 damage die, its damage die magically becomes a d10 after the attack.
	Immediately after you roll a 12 on a d12 damage die in this way, each creature within 5 feet of the greatclub (other than yourself) must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d12 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, as the weapon's crystals explode into shrapnel. Once the crystal explodes, the weapon's damage die becomes a d8 again.

    <text>This magic set of iron armor is forged from metals that fell from the sky. The armor has two parts that can be worn together simultaneously: a chain shirt and a set of half plate armor. You have a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to lightning damage while wearing this armor. While wearing the chain shirt, you can speak the armor's command word as an action to don or doff the starmetal nova armor's half plate, causing it to either magically assemble itself around you or release and fall to the ground at your feet. You must be within 30 feet of the half plate in order to don the armor in this way.
	In addition, you always know which way is north while attuned to the armor.

Polarity Repulsion. While wearing either part of this armor, when a creature that you can see that's holding or wearing a metal object (such as a metal weapon or suit of heavy or medium metal armor) moves within 10 feet of you for the first time on its turn, you can use your reaction to change the polarity of your armor's metal and repel yourself up to 10 feet away from that creature, without provoking opportunity attacks.

Supernova Burst. While wearing both the chain shirt and half plate parts of the armor, you can use an action to speak the armor's other command word to doff the half plate and cause it to explode from you, releasing a 30-foot-radius burst of bright light. When you do, you end any grapple condition on yourself and force all creatures other than you within the bright light that are not behind total cover to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 radiant damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. The half plate falls to the ground at your feet when doffed in this way.

    <text>This weapon's otherwise small blade is made larger by 3 sharp fragments of starmetal that remain magically connected to it. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you hit a creature with an attack using the head of this spear, you can choose to leave 1 of the fragments embedded in its body. As a bonus action, you can speak the spear's command word to cause all embedded shards to magically return to the blade of the spear, flying through the air and avoiding creatures and objects to do so. When you do, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage for each embedded shard as it leaves the body.
	If all 3 shards are embedded in the same creature when you speak the command word, the creature's speed is also halved until the end of your next turn. If the spear is ever more than 120 feet away from a shard, the shard magically returns to the spear without harming the creature it was embedded in. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the spear, the weapon flies back to your hand.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This slim blade was forged using strange, unearthly metals from a meteorite. When you use an action to toss this magic dagger into the air, it orbits your body at a distance of 1d3 feet. Another creature can use an action to grasp the dagger to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and either wield or stow the dagger.
	When you take the Attack action while the dagger is orbiting you, you can use a bonus action to cause the dagger to attack a target within 10 feet of you. The dagger uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls. Immediately after the attack, the dagger returns to orbit you.
	In addition, the dagger creates a small gravitational field that wards off harm. While the dagger orbits you, when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + 4. If the damage is reduced to 0, the missile slows to a stop without hitting you and falls to the ground at your feet.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers.

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Once on each of your turns when you attack with the spear, you can choose to make a special ranged attack with it, firing the spear head toward a target within 20 feet of you. This ranged attack uses your Dexterity modifier for its attack and damage rolls.
	On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet toward you. A Huge or larger target automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Hit or miss, the spear's head then reels back and reattaches to the top of the weapon immediately after the attack.

While holding this shield, you have resistance to lightning damage. When you take lightning damage from a hostile source while holding this shield, you can use your reaction to cast the thunderwave spell (save DC 15) from it. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
	In addition, while the shield is flat on the ground, you can perform a 1 minute ritual to cast the augury spell from it. When you do, the omens are represented by how the cyclone's design changes:

	• Calm clouds, for good results
	• Roiling clouds, for bad results
	• A flash of lightning, for both good and bad results
	• Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad

If the bracers have 5 charges when you hit a creature in this way, they unleash a burst of electricity and lose all their stored charges, dealing 1d8 lightning damage to the target of the attack and up to 2 other creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you.
	In addition, while wearing the bracers, you can use your reaction when you take lightning damage to reduce that damage by 1d8 + 4 and cause the bracers to gain 1 charge.

When you do, the familiar inhabits the form of the stuffed animal, whose appearance you can change as part of casting the spell in this way. The familiar is a construct, in addition to being either a celestial, fey, or fiend, but its statistics are otherwise unchanged from its normal form. The familiar's stuffed animal form must be appropriate to the statistics of its normal animal one. For example, a familiar within a griffon stuffed animal could use the statistics for a cat or hawk, but not a poisonous snake.
	The stuffed animal grows or shrinks to match the size of the familiar's normal form. While the familiar remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal stuffed animal. If you temporarily dismiss the familiar, the stuffed animal and familiar disappear into a pocket dimension together. If the familiar is dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the stuffed animal behind.

	Placing an object in one of the pants' pockets follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the pants requires an action as your hand rummages around inside for a few moments before finding the item it's looking for.
	If the pants are overloaded, pierced, or torn, they rupture and tear, scattering their contents in a 300-foot radius around you. Casting the mending spell on the pants daily for 30 days restores the pants' connection to the extradimensional spaces. If one or more pockets are turned inside out, their contents spill forth, unharmed, but the pocket must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the pocket can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.
	Placing the pants inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one way only and can't be reopened.

    <text>This book's magically charged pages are filled with detailed descriptions and illustrations that teach unique styles of combat. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, you gain one of the following Advanced Fighting Styles:

Advanced Simplicity. Your attacks made with simple weapons score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Crushing Blows. When you score a critical hit using a melee weapon that has the heavy property, the target takes extra bludgeoning damage equal to 5 + the ability score modifier you used for your attack and damage rolls.

Net Mastery. When you throw a net, its normal and long range is doubled. In addition, the first time that a creature attempts to escape from a net that you threw, the escape DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice), unless it's already higher.

Quick Shot. You gain a special reach with ranged weapons called a firing reach that's a number of feet equal to 5 + your normal reach. While you are wielding a ranged weapon, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move out of your firing reach.

Readied Bulwark. You gain a +2 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks while holding a shield.

Versatile Expert. When you hit with an attack using a weapon that has the versatile property, you can use the two-handed damage die even if you're only wielding the weapon with one hand.

You can't take an Advanced Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Once the book has been used to grant an Advanced Fighting Style, it loses its magic, but regains it in a century

If the added spell is a wizard spell and of a level for which you have spell slots, you can prepare this spell just like your other spells. If the spell is not a wizard spell, its notation is garbled and impossible to use. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until a number of days equal to the spell's level have passed.

Shift Knowledge. While using this book as your spellbook, you can replace up to 3 spells from your prepared list of spells when you finish a short rest. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Unknown Knowledge. While holding the book, you can use an action to channel its hidden knowledge.
	When you do, you gain proficiency in one skill or tool of your choice until the next dawn. If you're already proficient in the chosen skill or tool, your proficiency bonus is instead doubled for any ability check you make using that skill or tool. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Curse. This book is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the book, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you are compelled to use this book as your spellbook. Each time you prepare a spell from another spellbook, you take psychic damage equal to the spell's level.

    <text>This large, gilded mirror is 5 feet tall, 3 feet across, and weighs 20 pounds. While the mirror is against a wall or similar vertical surface, you can speak its first command word using an action to magically fasten the mirror to the wall. You can unfasten the mirror by speaking the command word again using another action.
	While the mirror is fastened to a wall, its reflective surface becomes oily and moves ever so slightly. If the fastened mirror is facing a room that's no larger than 40 feet on a side for 24 hours, the reflection stiffens and becomes a beautiful painting of the room's reflection.
	The painting remains until the mirror is removed from the wall. While the painting remains, a creature can use an action to touch its surface and speak the mirror's second command word to be magically transported to a special demiplane identical to the room the mirror is facing, including any of its furniture and decorations. Doing so again from within the demiplane transports you back to the nearest unoccupied space to the mirror in the original room. Any furniture or decoration created by the demiplane can't be removed from it, and if a piece of furniture or decoration was magical in the original room, the copy of it is not. Further, any doors or windows found in the original room don't appear in the demiplane's version.
	Anything brought into the demiplane is shunted back to the original room when the mirror is removed from the wall. While the painting remains, it is indistinguishable from a regular painting. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Investigation) check can reveal the true nature of the painting, but not what command words are required to use it.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This pair of gloves is matched with one dark metal gauntlet, which once belonged to a traitorous knight who was burned for his treason. While wearing these gloves and gauntlet, your unarmed strikes with your hands are turned into magic weapons that deal 1d8 necrotic damage.
	In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak the gauntlet's command word while holding a nonmagical melee weapon in the hand that's wearing it. When you do, the weapon becomes magical while you hold it in that hand. The weapon ceases to be magical if you throw, drop, or stow it. While the weapon is magical in this way, it's wreathed in dark flames that cause any target hit by it to take necrotic damage, instead of the weapon's normal damage, as well as an extra 1d8 fire damage.
	While unworn, the gauntlet can be magically altered to fit over either hand by speaking its other command word as an action.

Curse. This gauntlet is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the gauntlet, keeping it within reach at all times, and you can't remove the gloves. In addition, while you're cursed, you gain the following flaw: "Everyone has an ulterior motive, so I can only count on myself." While you have this flaw, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with friendly creatures, and you can't take the Help action.

    <text>This heavy crossbow carries with it the force of a raging bull. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic weapon, the bolt transforms into a spectral stampede immediately after it hits the target. When it does, the target and up to 2 other targets of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, and if it is Large or smaller, it's pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed. This bludgeoning damage is doubled against objects and structures.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>This industrial, hollow rod is 3 feet long and weighs 15 pounds. The rod has a tapered spike on one end and an open, tower-like chimney on the other. Three hinged legs unfold from the sides of the rod, allowing it to stand upright with its spiked end pointed downward. Standing or collapsing the rod in this way requires an action.
	The unfolded legs magically fasten the rod to the ground while it's standing, but a creature can use its action to try to push it over with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Once the rod is no longer standing, it magically deactivates and collapses itself again.
	As a bonus action, you can press a button on the standing rod to cause its mechanisms to churn and whir, repeatedly sending its spike into the ground below it. Pressing the button again deactivates the rod. The spike sends out loud, drum-like shockwaves every 6 seconds. The waves are audible out to 300 feet, or 1200 feet if a creature has tremorsense. If a creature has tremorsense, its range is halved while it's within 300 feet of the active rod. A creature can't perceive anything within 30 feet of the active rod using its tremorsense, but is aware that the disrupting shockwaves originate from that location.

While holding the axe, you can use a bonus action to rampage. While rampaging, you can move through the space of any creature of your size or smaller. When you move through a creature's space in this way while rampaging, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn. Once on each of your turns while rampaging, you can force a creature whose space you move through in this way to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, that creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. In addition, while you're rampaging, your weapon attacks with this weapon score a critical hit against objects, structures, and prone creatures on a roll of 19 or 20.
	Your rampage lasts for up to 1 minute. It ends early if you don't move through a hostile creature's space on your turn or if you drop to 0 hit points. This property of the axe can be used twice and regains all expended uses daily at dawn

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>This set of royal finery was worn by a noble necromancer with a unique appreciation for the quality of life that extends beyond death. Asphodel blossoms, representing life beyond the tomb, ornament this enchanted outfit. The lush flowers in its laurel crown are nestled among long-dead leaves.
	While wearing the regalia, you can cast the animate dead spell from it over the course of 1 minute. You can use this property a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain all expended uses daily at dusk. When you create an undead using a necromancy spell, the creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

Chthonic Command. As an action, you can issue a command of either dismissal or obedience to an undead creature within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature immune to features that turn undead automatically succeeds on the saving throw. On a failed save, you can impose one of the following effects on that creature for 1 minute:

	• The creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move into a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. This effect ends early if that creature takes any damage.

	• The creature is charmed by you. While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. Each time the creature takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If the saving throw succeeds, the effect ends.You can use this property a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. You regain all expended uses daily at dusk.

Ruler of the Dead. You are always under the effects of the sanctuary spell. This version of the spell only affects undead. If you make an attack or cast a spell that affects an undead creature, that creature is immune to this spell's effects for 24 hours.

    <text>This item appears to be a small cremation urn. While grasping the urn, you can use a bonus action to speak its first command word and cause its lid to unseal. When you do, a curved blade of dark smoke pours from the mouth of the urn. Speaking the command word again reseals the urn and causes the blade to disappear. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the urnblade.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals necrotic damage instead of slashing damage.

Shadow Ally. While holding the urn, you can use an action to speak its second command word to animate your body's shadow, transforming it into an undead creature. When you do, your body's shadow detaches from you and becomes a shadow in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. On your turn, you can mentally command the shadow if you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the shadow takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. The GM has the shadow's statistics. This shadow doesn't cause a new one to appear when a non-evil humanoid dies from its attacks.

The urnblade's bonus to attack and damage rolls becomes +2 while the summoned shadow exists. In addition, if you are the target of an attack and are within 5 feet of the shadow, you can use your reaction to command your shadow to become the target of the attack instead.
	The shadow disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, when it's farther than 120 feet from you, or when you use an action to dismiss it. When it disappears, your cast shadow returns. If the shadow drops to 0 hit points, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance that the urn turns to dust and is destroyed.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>This elegant brass rapier was originally wielded by a beloved king, whose empathy and care for his subjects lives on within the blade. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d8 fire damage. In addition, you can use this rapier as a spellcasting focus.
	The rapier has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, a number of gems inside the guard equal to the weapon's remaining charges glow red. When you expend a charge from the rapier, it releases a plume of dark smoke from one of the gems.
	If an attacker makes a spell attack against you or a target within 5 feet of you while you're holding the rapier, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses and was a spell of 1st level or higher, the rapier regains 1 expended charge.
	While holding the rapier, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to give one of three decrees that affect the flow of magic and battle:

"Clemency." When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a single creature, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to cause a different creature within 10 feet of the original target to regain 1d8 hit points per spell level. When you do, each creature has advantage on the next ability check or saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.

"Condemn." When you cast a spell that deals damage to a single creature, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to cause that target as well as a different creature within 10 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw using your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 fire damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much fire damage and makes its next attack roll as normal.

"Overrule." After you roll dice to restore hit points to a single creature or roll damage for a spell attack or attack using this weapon, you can expend up to 2 charges (no action required) to change the result of those dice. For each charge you spend, you can use the highest number possible for two of those dice instead of the numbers you rolled.

Flaw. The Violet King's promise makes its wielder empathic and reluctant to resort to violence. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I am slow to resort to violence, even if it's at the cost of my own safety." In addition, if you are attuned to the weapon for 24 consecutive hours, your soft-heartedness causes you to lose your ferocity and battle-readiness. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks and take a –5 penalty to initiative rolls. These effects can be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the weapon.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

    <text>This curved blade was carved from a large viper's fang. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a Large or smaller creature, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the start of your next turn.
	The poisoned creature is incapacitated. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much poison damage and isn't poisoned.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This cushioned leather and rope collar is easily adjustable to fit the necks of all manner of creatures.
	You can place the collar on a willing Medium or smaller creature using an action. If the creature is a friendly beast companion or familiar (such as one summoned by the find familiar spell), you can speak the collar's command word as part of this action to create a magical bond between you and the creature. The bond remains until the collar is removed.
	You can use a bonus action to speak the collar's command word while you can see the bonded creature within 30 feet of you. When you do, the creature grows in size to become Large, provided there's enough space. The enlarged creature gains a +2 bonus to AC (provided it isn't wearing armor), its speed increases by 10 feet, and is magically equipped with a bridle, reins, and saddle. The enlarged creature can understand the directions of any friendly creature that's riding it, and its carrying capacity magically becomes the same as a riding horse. The creature remains enlarged for up to 8 hours, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you end the effect using a bonus action. Once this property of the collar has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
	If the beast or familiar wearing the collar is a transformed humanoid or other creature, such as by the polymorph spell or similar magic, the bond fails when you speak the command word and the collar has no effect. If the bonded creature is a familiar summoned by the find familiar spell, the collar and familiar disappear into a pocket dimension together whenever you temporarily dismiss it. If the bonded familiar is dismissed forever or drops to 0 hit points, it leaves the collar behind. A creature can only gain the benefits of one magical collar at a time.

    <text>This cloak once belonged to an elven archer of masterful skill. Its shoulders are ornamented with furs and seasonal leaves, and it bears a clasp at its center made from intertwined branches. While wearing the cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. As a bonus action, you can use a free hand to break the cloak's clasp and transform the cloak into a +3 longbow that appears in your hand.
	While attuned to the cloak, you are proficient with this magical longbow, and your ranged attacks with it ignore half cover. While holding the bow, you can use a bonus action to speak its command phrase in Elvish, "The arrow's path was true." When you do, the bow transforms into the cloak again and appears draped around your shoulders or in your hand (your choice).
	While the cloak or bow is on your person, you can use an action to focus your awareness on the surrounding region. For 1 hour, you can sense if any of the following creature types are present within 1 mile of you: aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. You know the type of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. This property doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number. Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This golden wand is a classic royal family heirloom and has a delicate lily at its end that flowers when held. While holding the wand, you can use the following properties:

Enhance Beauty. You can use an action to point the wand at a living target you can see within 30 feet of you and magically enhance its beauty for 1 hour. If the target is a creature, its eyelashes may become thicker, its skin more radiant, and its hair more luscious. If it's a plant, it may grow more vibrant, smell more fragrant, and look visibly healthier.

Gild. As an action, you can touch the wand to a target no larger than 1 foot in any dimension to cause it to appear to be made of gold for 1 hour. Its appearance and texture change to reflect the new appearance, but its weight remains the same. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the effect is illusory. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dirt and is destroyed.

Spells. While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15): alter self (Change Appearance only), charm person (2nd-level version), enthrall, or hypnotic pattern.

Silver Tongue. While holding this wand, when you make a Charisma check or saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend 1 of its charges to make the roll with advantage.

    <text>This wand is made from a sprig of holly and exudes an unmistakable aura of cheer from it. It has 10 holly berries that each contain 1 charge and are used to fuel the wand's properties. When you expend a charge from a berry, it wilts away and disappears. The wand regrows 1d6 + 4 missing berries daily at dawn. While you're attuned to the wand, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma checks and saving throws.

Spells. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 16) from it: create food and water (3 charges), goodberry (1 charge), hideous laughter (1 charge), or irresistible dance (6 charges).

Dashing through the Snow. While holding the wand, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 of its charges to take the Dash action. When you do, you ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

Festive. As an action, you can wave this wand over up to 1 gallon of water and expend 1 charge to transform the liquid into a weak, but pleasant-tasting, alcoholic beverage.

If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, all but one of the wand's leaves and berry stems wither away and die. When this happens, the wand becomes a common wand that does not require attunement, but has only 1 charge. This common version of the wand retains only the festive property of its original form and regains the expended charge daily at dawn.

	While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15, attack bonus +7) blight (4 charges), finger of death (7 charges), inflict wounds (1 charge per spell level, plus 1 additional charge to make its range 30 feet), or ray of enfeeblement (2 charges).
	The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand explodes, destroying the wand in a flash of green light that duplicates the effect of the finger of death spell, targeting only you. If you become a zombie as a result of this effect, you are under the command of the nearest lich within 100 miles of you, if any.

    <type>WD</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This wand is made of wood and looks like the handle of a marionette. The wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to attach a number of magical strings equal to the charges spent to a humanoid that you can see within 60 feet of you. You can attach 1 string to each of the creature's limbs, including its head. For example, a humanoid with two legs, two arms, and only one head could have a maximum of 5 strings attached to it. The strings are invisible, but can be seen by a creature with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
	Dealing 10 slashing damage with a magical weapon attack to one of the strings (AC 10) causes it to detach and disappear. At the end of each of its turns, a strung creature can make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, breaking free of and destroying any number of the strings connected to it on a success. The strings break early if the creature is more than 100 feet away from you.
	While a creature has a string attached to one or more of its limbs, the following effects occur depending on the location of the strings:

Arm or Hand. A creature with a string attached to one of its arms or hands must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw each time it attempts to use it, such as making a weapon attack, climbing a wall, or using an item. On a failed save, the action, attack, check, or saving throw fails and is lost. If an action requires multiple arms and only one of the creature's arms has a string attached, it makes this saving throw with advantage. If the strung arm is holding a shield, the creature doesn't gain the benefits of holding it for the duration. In addition, you can use an action to force the creature to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, dropping any number of items it's holding with the strung arms or hands on a failure.

Head. A creature with a string attached to its head has disadvantage on Intelligence checks, Wisdom (Perception) checks, and Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell when it takes damage. You can use an action to force the creature to speak on your turn, saying a word or phrase no longer than twenty-five words.

Leg. A creature with a string attached to one or more of its legs (or similar limbs) has its speed reduced by 15 feet for each strung limb. If a flying creature's speed is reduced to 0 in this way, it falls to the ground at a rate of 60 feet per round and takes no falling damage when it lands. A creature with a string attached to each of its legs has disadvantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Dexterity saving throws.

Spell. Alternatively, you can expend 5 charges to cast the dominate person spell (save DC 16) from the wand. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand becomes nonmagical.

	The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand scatters into glittering dust and is destroyed.

Spells. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 15) from it: color spray (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), daylight (3 charges), hypnotic pattern (3 charges), light (no charges), magic missile (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), or prestidigitation (no charges).

Starlight Wayfinder. While you can see stars in the sky and are holding the wand, you can use an action to call out a cardinal direction and expend 1 of its charges.

When you do, stars in that direction appear brighter to you for 1 hour or until you use the wand again to call out a new direction.

    <text>This wand was made using the horn of a unicorn and feather of a pegasus for the queen for Orostead, a powerful mage whose skilled leadership made her a favorite among her city's citizens and military. The wand has 7 charges, which are used for the following properties, and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Spells. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): dispel evil and good (1 charge), find steed (a pegasus, 1 charge), guiding bolt (6th-level version, 1 charge, +10 to hit with ranged spell attack), or sacred flame (no charges, cast at 5th level).

Create Wings. While holding the wand, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge from the wand to summon a pair of magical pegasus wings from your back for 1 hour. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet.
	Alternatively, while holding the wand, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cause the wings to appear on the back of a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. When you do, that creature can immediately use its reaction to fly up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. At the end of your turn, the wings vanish.

Healing Light. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges from the wand to cause a beam of healing light to shine down on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature regains 10 hit points for each charge you spend and is cured of either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. If a creature regains hit points in this way that would take it above its hit point maximum, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to the number of restored hit points above its hit point maximum.

Each sculpture must appear in an unoccupied space on the ground you can see within range. Each sculpture is a delicate, thorned rose made of ice and is always a Medium object with 1 hit point and AC 12. A sculpture melts after 1 minute, or 8 hours if it's in an area of extreme cold. If a sculpture falls to 0 hit points, it erupts in an icy blast and is destroyed, causing all creatures within 20 feet of it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. An ice sculpture caught in this explosion erupts automatically, intensifying the blast. A creature takes 3d8 piercing damage and 3d6 cold damage on a failed save, plus an extra 1d8 piercing damage for each explosion it's affected by beyond the first. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much piercing damage and cold damage.
	The sculptures softly groan and crackle from the pressure they contain within them. A creature can determine the explosive nature of the sculptures with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Investigation) check. Spaces occupied by the icy sculptures are difficult terrain.
	The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into a puddle of water, and the frostrose at its center crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

    <text>This golden axe is enchanted with haphazard divination magic. Its split blade features a spade, club, heart, and diamond on each of its four faces. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a target with this weapon, you can choose to roll a second d20 before calculating the weapon's damage. If you roll an 11 or higher on the second d20, the blade magically seeks out and hits the weakest point of the target, turning the attack into a critical hit. On a roll of 10 or lower, the blade ricochets harmlessly off the original target and scores a critical hit against you, instead. When the axe hits you in this way, its damage ignores resistances and immunity.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, greataxe

    <text>This double-bladed spear is extraordinarily light and perfectly balanced for use with one hand. While holding this magic spear with one hand, it has the finesse property. Whenever you take the Attack action and make a melee attack with the spear using only one hand, you can use a bonus action to make an additional attack with the spear. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.
	Immediately after you use your bonus action in this way, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, though you can't move farther than your remaining movement would allow.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This platinum staff has a wide brazier on top with a small crystal orb that floats above it. While holding the staff, its brazier is lit with harmless, holy flames that shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage.
	A friendly creature within reach of the staff can use its bonus action to remove the crystal orb that floats above the brazier. While the orb is on their person, that creature is under the effect of the warding bond spell as if you cast it. The spell lasts until the orb is more than 60 feet away from you, until you're no longer holding the staff, or until you die or are incapacitated. You can also choose to mentally end the spell at any time (no action required). When the spell ends, the orb teleports back to the head of the staff.
	In addition, while a creature other than you that you can see is carrying the orb, you can use a bonus action to speak the orb's command word and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of that creature. Alternatively, a creature holding the orb can use its bonus action to speak the orb's command word and teleport to an unoccupied space that it can see within 5 feet of you instead. This property of the orb can't be used again until the next dawn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Eruption. The first time that the warhammer hits a target in combat, it starts to release a steady stream of embers and smoke. When this happens, and while the hammer is smoldering in this way, it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. At the end of each of your turns while the hammer is smoldering, its fire becomes increasingly unstable. At the end of the third turn, the hammer erupts, spraying lava and releasing a volcanic storm from it in a 30-foot cone in a direction of your choice (no action required). Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The lava then vanishes. The warhammer cools and doesn't erupt if combat ends or if you drop or stow the weapon before it erupts. Once the warhammer erupts, it loses this property until 2d6 hours have passed.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

While holding the rod or its batons, you can use an action to speak the rod's first command word to split it into the batons or recombine them again.
	While holding one of the split batons, you can use an action to speak the rod's second command word to cast the teleport spell from it, teleporting only yourself to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the other baton, even if it's on another plane of existence. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the batons have spent at least 12 hours recombined as the rod, at which point the swirling mist reappears within the orbs.

The next 25 words you speak within 10 minutes sound virtually indistinguishable from the voice you chose, though a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the voice is magically altered. If the voice you chose belongs to another creature, that creature automatically knows that the voice is altered.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This spinning metal sphere is 6 inches in diameter and weighs 5 pounds. You can tap the orb twice as an action to activate it. While activated, the orb records basic details about the space that it can see within 100 feet.
The orb has darkvision out to 100 feet, but can't see through heavily obscured areas or illusions. Tapping it twice again deactivates the orb. The activated orb can display its recorded maps. If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak its first command word, followed by a description of a location it's mapped. For example, you can command the orb to recall the entrance to a series of catacombs you explored 2 days ago, or the path you took to get through a twisting labyrinth. When you do, an illusory map appears in a 5-foot sphere centered on the orb that shows basic details about the recorded area, such as buildings, pathways, roads, signs, topography, and trees. While you're within 5 feet of the map, you can use a series of intuitive gestures to change the map's rotation, displayed location, or scale: showing as little of the recorded area as a 25-foot radius, or as much as a 1-mile radius. Speaking the command word again causes the map to vanish.
	If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak a second command word as an action to make the orb rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The orb hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 30 feet from the hovering orb, it follows you until it is within 30 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the orb sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive.
	You can speak a third command word as an action, followed by a location name, while within 30 feet of the floating orb to cause it to move on its own. If the named location has been recorded by the orb and is within 1 mile of you, the sphere moves on its own and floats up to 10 feet ahead of you, guiding you to the named location using any of its recorded maps of the area to guide you.
	Once you reach your destination or speak the command word again, the orb begins to follow you again.

The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Commend: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to touch a creature other than yourself with this weapon to restore 1d8 + 2 hit points to that creature.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, handaxe

On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

	A weapon of verdict has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn. You can use these charges to create the following effects:

Condemn: When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target.

Commend: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to touch a creature other than yourself with this weapon to restore 1d8 + 2 hit points to that creature.

A hoopak is a sturdy stick with a sling at one end and a pointed tip at the other.

Special: When you make a melee attack with this weapon, you ignore its ammunition property. You can use the hoopak as a martial ranged weapon. If you do, it uses the ammunition property, uses sling bullets, and deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Proficiency: martial, hoopak

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

    <text>This pair of dark, chiseled throwing needles are linked by a magical bond. A needle that hits a Large or smaller creature flies around it for 1 minute or until the creature falls to 0 hit points. If both needles fly around the same creature, they spin a magical thread that binds and restrains it. The creature is restrained until freed or until you take a bonus action to speak the needles' command word to release it. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Once the needles restrain a creature in this way, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
	In addition, you can use the needles as a set of weaver's tools. These magical needles can act on their own to either mend a simple tear or craft a simple garment given the proper materials in 1 minute or over the course of a short rest, respectively. As an action, you can speak the needles' other command word, followed by a description of the task, to cause them to spring to life and begin sewing and crafting. Uttering this command word again causes them to stop early and fall to the ground

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

    <text>This 8-armed bow uses the remains of a spindly spider's legs and maw. The bow has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack with the bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to lace it with sticky spider silk. On a hit, the arrow magically sheds the silk and releases it as a net-like web. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it and each Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained until the end of your next turn. If the target is a Large creature, only it must succeed on the saving throw instead. Huge and larger creatures are unaffected by the web.

Summon Spiders: While holding the weapon, you can use an action to speak its command word to summon 2 swarms of insects (spiders) or 1 giant spider, which appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 10 feet of you. The GM has the creatures' statistics. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, after 1 hour, or when you end the effect early as a bonus action. Once this property of the bow has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>These magic weapons were forged with lightweight metals and designed for speed rather than brute force.
	Whirling weapons have the finesse and light properties and whistle softly when swung through the air. When you take the Attack action and attack with a whirling weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make another attack with the same weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you're holding a different whirling weapon in each hand and engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make one attack with each weapon when you use a bonus action in this way.
	In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attacks.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>These magic weapons were forged with lightweight metals and designed for speed rather than brute force.
	Whirling weapons have the finesse and light properties and whistle softly when swung through the air. When you take the Attack action and attack with a whirling weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make another attack with the same weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you're holding a different whirling weapon in each hand and engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make one attack with each weapon when you use a bonus action in this way.
	In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attacks.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

	In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attacks.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

If you're holding a different whirling weapon in each hand and engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make one attack with each weapon when you use a bonus action in this way.
	In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attacks.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: martial, shortsword

	In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attacks.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

	Whirling weapons have the finesse and light properties and whistle softly when swung through the air. When you take the Attack action and attack with a whirling weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make another attack with the same weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you're holding a different whirling weapon in each hand and engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make one attack with each weapon when you use a bonus action in this way.
	In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attacks.

A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, yklwa

    <text>This dart feels cold and hefty in the hand, but flies effortlessly when thrown. As an action, you can throw this dart at a point within 20 feet of you and speak its command word to cause it to create a wild, spiraling whirlpool in a 15-foot-radius, 10-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature in the area excluding you must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 15 feet toward the center of the cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.
	In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the cylinder are automatically pulled 15 feet toward the center by this effect, and all nonmagical flames within the cylinder are extinguished. The dart's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the dart can still be used as a magic weapon.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>A whispergust mote is a sentient breath of air typically separated from a larger air elemental. When not invisible, its form resembles a dollop of blue whipped cream but is weightless and fluid to the touch. The mote can use an action to become invisible, but it typically only does so when it senses danger. When left to its own devices, the mote will gently tousle the hair of passing creatures or flip a fallen leaf. While it is a form that is defined by its wanderlust, it nevertheless enjoys the company and experiences of adventuring parties that travel to new and unique locations. Most owners of a whispergust mote are rarely so bold as to claim ownership of it at all.
	The mote is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover. It has AC 10, 5 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The whispergust mote regains all its hit points if affected by a gust of wind spell or similar magic.

Sentience. The whispergust mote is a sentient chaotic good item with an Intelligence of 1, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 7. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can't speak or read, but understands Auran and Common. Personality. The whispergust mote ultimately travels where it wants to go, but knows that companionship is often worth the limitations that come with it. In even the most dull of places, the mote will find ways to entertain itself—often to the panic or frustration of the creatures it travels with.

The malignant spirit of a hag lives within the teapot and corrupts the first cup of tea that it pours into one of the matching teacups. The first creature that drinks this cup of tea must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as the hag's spirit assaults it from the inside. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 poison damage and is paralyzed for 1 minute.
	On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a paralyzed creature can make another DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

    <text>This ammunition smolders while you hold it, sparking softly with simmering embers. When you use this arrow or bolt to make a ranged weapon attack, it vanishes in a scattering of sparks immediately after it's fired: disappearing into a special extradimensional space without hitting a target. The ammunition's flames burn hotter the longer it remains in this space and can stay there for up to 3 rounds.
	You can use a bonus action on your turn to speak the ammunition's command word and choose a point you can see within 120 feet of where you fired it from. When you do, the arrow or bolt reappears directly above the point and explodes, creating a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of searing flames centered on that point.
	Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 fire damage, plus an extra 2d8 fire damage for every round the ammunition remained in its pocket dimension. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
	If the ammunition remains in its extradimensional space for the full duration without its command word being spoken, it reappears and explodes above a random point within 120 feet of where it was fired.
	An arrow or bolt is destroyed when it explodes in this way.

You can seal or unseal a bottle, flask, jar, waterskin, or similar container with the stopper as an action. When you do, the stopper magically resizes to fit the container's opening (up to 6 inches in diameter). While a container is stoppered in this way, any nonliving liquid inside it doesn't age, decay, rot, or spoil. If the container has a tap or similar means of dispensing the liquid without unstoppering it (such as a keg), the effect on the liquid ends once it leaves the vessel.

	While wearing these boots, you can use an action to speak their command word to cast the gaseous form spell, transforming yourself into a swirling cloud of vapor and leaves. This version of the spell lasts for up to 1 minute, but only allows you to float vertically using your movement speed. Your horizontal movement speed while in this form is decided by the direction and speed of the wind. A wind of light speed (between 5 and 10 miles per hour) propels you 10 feet per round, whereas a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) pushes you 20 feet instead.
	Traveling somewhere while in this form where the swirling leaves are unable to follow you ends the effect early. Once the boots have been used to cast this spell, they can't do so again until the next dawn.

    <text>This pair of scimitars was forged in the Elemental Plane of Air and cut effortlessly through the air in tandem. Attuning to one of the scimitars automatically attunes you to both of them, which count as one attuned item.
	You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons, which have the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with one of the scimitars, it flies back to your hand. In addition, when you engage in two-weapon fighting using both scimitars, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
	As an action, you can speak the scimitars' command words and throw the two swords at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The two weapons spin wildly and create a sudden whirlwind in a 15-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on the point. A target caught in the whirlwind's area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the point in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. On a successful save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone. The scimitars fly back to your hands immediately after the effect. Once this property of the scimitars has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>This soft toy figurine is 5 inches tall and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to wind up the toy using a crank in the back, causing it to release a thin strip of parchment listing 3 magic items and their costs from the list below. The toy then whirs and animates slowly, walking and bowing slightly, and can't be wound up again until 24 hours have passed.
	Roll 3d12, recording each number rolled, to determine which of the following magic items are listed on the parchment. At the GM's discretion, reroll duplicate results.

Wind-Up Merchant:
d12 | Item Name | Cost
1 | potion of climbing | 25 gp
2 | potion of healing, common | 25 gp
3 | spell scroll, 1st level: comprehend languages (25%), detect magic (25%), feather fall (25%), or identify (25%) | 25 gp
4 | broom of flying | 50 gp
5 | dust of disappearance | 50 gp
6 | eversmoking bottle | 50 gp
7 | goggles of night | 50 gp
8 | immovable rod | 50 gp
9 | potion of growth | 50 gp
10 | potion of resistance | 50 gp
11 | restorative ointment, 2 uses | 50 gp
12 | ring of water walking | 50 gp

While the toy is animated, you can use an action to deposit any number of coins into the slot on the toy's belly and speak the name of an item listed on the parchment. If the value of the coins deposited in the toy is equal to or greater than the cost of the named item, the item magically appears in your hand or at your feet (your choice) and is removed from the parchment. The spent coins are then lost.
	The toy remains animated for 5 minutes or until each item has been purchased from the list. When the toy stops animating, any deposited coins that weren't spent on the listed items clatter to the ground below it, converting them into smaller denominations as needed, and the parchment turns to dust and is destroyed.
	An item purchased from the wind-up merchant disappears after 24 hours, or early if you attempt to sell or trade it to another creature.

	In addition, when you take the Attack action while wearing the wraps, you can use a bonus action immediately before or after one of your attacks to cause a piece of the wrapping to lash out at a target within 10 feet of you. Make a melee spell attack for the wrapping, using an attack bonus of +7. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage.
	The wraps have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can hold out your hand and expend 1 or more of the wraps' charges to release a blast of sand from it in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the start of your next turn, and for each charge you spend, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus 2d8 necrotic damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.

Curse. Once you don these cursed wraps, you can't doff them unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While wearing the wraps, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against undead and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities. In addition, while cursed, you don't recover as much from resting. When you roll Hit Dice to regain hit points, roll each one of the dice twice and use the lower result

    <text>This bracelet has 1d6 + 3 colorful, egg-shaped beads hanging from it. Ten types of beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the bracelet or determines it randomly. A bracelet can have more than one bead of the same type. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it into an unoccupied space that you can see up to 30 feet away from you. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead cracks open, destroying the bead, and summons a dragon wyrmling in the space. The type of wyrmling is determined by the bead's color.

1 | Black

3 | Brass
4 | Bronze
5 | Copper
6 | Gold
7 | Green

10 | White

A summoned wyrmling disappears after 1 hour, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when you summon another wyrmling. The wyrmling shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It is friendly to you and your companions until you threaten or harm it. The wyrmling obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. When the last bead has been used, the wristlet becomes nonmagical.

    <text>This bow is crafted with delicate dragon scales and strung with a fiber from a dragon's heart. While holding the bow, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word and channel the energy of the dragon within. When you do, the bow forms a draconic cowl of elemental energy around you. For the duration of the cowl, you gain the following benefits:

	• You gain 25 temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute.

	• You have resistance to damage of the same type as the elemental energy of the cowl. The type of energy is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the bow's scales, as shown on the table below.

	• On a hit, the bow deals an extra 1d8 damage of the same type as the cowl's energy. If the target is a dragon, this extra damage ignores any resistance or immunity it has against that damage type.

The cowl remains until you lose all these temporary points. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn or until the bow is used to slay or help slay a Large or larger dragon. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

When you hit a creature that is not a construct, plant, or undead with this sword, that creature takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage. If the sword has dealt necrotic damage in this way in the past hour, you can use an action to hold the sword aloft and speak its command word to summon a blood elemental, as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell.
	Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. A blood elemental uses the same statistics as a water elemental, with the following changes:

	• The blood elemental has resistance to necrotic damage in addition to its other resistances.
	• The blood elemental's alignment is neutral evil.

When you hit with an attack using this sword while the blood elemental is under your control and within 120 feet of you, the elemental regains a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt by the sword.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This pair of iron-toed boots is made with the rocky leather hide of a xorn. Each boot is secured with three golden buttons bearing the icon of an eye and has several claw-like spikes extending from its toe and heel. While wearing these boots, you can use a bonus action to speak their command word and click the boots' heels together. If you do, you gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet and a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.
	You can use this property for up to 10 minutes, all at once or in several shorter bursts, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. During this time, you can pinpoint the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within the range of your tremorsense. When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.

    <text>This burnt yellow armor is the mark of a royal scout. Its magical construction is unyielding to all but the most lithe and capable of scouts and huntsmen.
	While wearing the armor, you gain a +5 bonus to any Dexterity (Stealth) check you make. While you have more than half your Hit Dice remaining, you can choose to expend 2 of them as an action to extend this property to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you for 1 hour. When you do, each affected creature, including yourself, has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature only benefits from this effect if it remains within 30 feet of you.
	The armor has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to use one of the following properties:

"At Arrow's Length!" When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you uses its reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the armor's charges to summon a spectral arrow from the air above it. The arrow flies harmlessly in front of the attacking creature and disappears, distracting them from the attack and causing the roll to be made with disadvantage. If the attacking creature has blindsight, this property has no effect. If you're concentrating on the hunter's mark spell, you can choose to move your mark to this creature as part of your reaction.
	Alternatively, if a hostile creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to immediately move up to half your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.

"From Sky to Earth!" As an action, you can expend 4 charges from the armor to summon a volley of spectral arrows from the sky, choosing a point that you can see within 120 feet of you when you do. The arrows fall in a 30-foot radius, 60-foot high cylinder centered on that point and then disappear. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

"There Is No Escape!" You can use a bonus action to expend up to 3 of the armor's charges to cast the hunter's mark spell from it. If you choose to expend 2 charges, you cast the spell at 3rd level, or 5th level if you choose to expend 3.

Flaw. The Yellow Harbinger's path compels its wearer to be cautious and over-prepared. While attuned to the armor, you gain the following flaw: "I am duty-bound to lay out the perfect plan for every situation. Uncertainty is unacceptable." In addition, if you are attuned to the armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or your GM determine who this person is. You consider this person your field commander and put their plans ahead of your own and trust them implicitly. You can't attune to the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise. If you're already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your field commander, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the Red Queen's burden or Violet King's promise without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the armor.

    <name>Arista, Wand of the Spire (HB)</name>
    <detail>artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</detail>
    <type>WD</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This elegant silver and gold wand was crafted by the archmages that first arrived in Orostead centuries ago, well before the magical fallout of the Upheaval. It has been carefully used by only the extremely powerful or clever for generations. The wand has 7 charges for some of the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge and are not a wizard, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand vanishes and returns to a secret vault within The Spire of Aristaeus, the legendary wizarding tower in Orostead.

Variant Properties. Some properties of this artifact are locked behind layers of dormant magic. As you grow stronger and reach certain milestones, these properties may become available to you. This wand can have up to 3 of the following properties active at a time. When you attune to Arista, you can choose to activate up to 3 of its variant properties whose prerequisites you meet.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace any of the activated properties with another one. While holding the wand, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: create or destroy water, floating disk, fog cloud, gaseous form, identify, or sanctuary. Once the wand has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the magic missile spell. When you reach 9th level, this spell is cast at 2nd level instead, and is cast at 3rd level once you reach 13th.

(Prerequisite: 5th level) You gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and spell save DC. This bonus increases to +2 when you reach 9th level, and +3 when you reach 17th.

(Prerequisite: 5th-level wizard) While holding the wand, you can use an action to cast the unseen servant spell.

(Prerequisite: 9th level) While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 of its charges to create one of the following effects, using your spell save DC:

Drilling Gust. You harness the ever-present winds of Lake Ils and tighten them into a magic, twisting spear. The spear flies from the wand and forms a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide, piercing through any creature in the area. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 cold damage and is pushed 15 feet away from you. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage from the effect and isn't pushed.

Siphoning Vortex. You conjure the strange undercurrents of Lake Ils and create a magical whirlpool in a 15-foot-radius circle at a point on the ground you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 10 feet toward the point. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also knocked prone and spends its action on its next turn coughing and sputtering water. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pulled. The water spreads out across the ground, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area, and then it vanishes.

(Prerequisite: 9th-level wizard) While holding the wand, you can expend 3 of its charges to cast the banishment spell, using your spell save DC. In addition, you are always under the effects of the see invisibility spell.

(Prerequisite: 13th level) While holding the wand, you gain truesight out to a range of 10 feet.

(Prerequisite: 13th-level wizard) While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: arcanist's magic aura (1 charge), dimension door (2 charges), etherealness (5 charges), fog cloud (4 charges; 1 mile-radius sphere that remains for the duration of the spell), guards and wards (4 charges), private sanctum (2 charges), teleport (5 charges).

(Prerequisite: 20th-level wizard) You gain the benefits of all of this wand's variant properties.

Destroying Arista. The only way to destroy Arista, Wand of the Spire is to leave it in an antimagic field on the Ethereal Plane for 100 years, at which point it finally succumbs and becomes nonmagical, allowing it to be easily snapped in two.

    <text>This black iron axe was forged in the scorching fires of the Magmarath Caldera and has been the decisive end for countless mortal souls. Used as the mark of a Tribunal in the caldera's city, the weapon is an embodiment of anger and spite, and has been enchanted with blood magic that bubbles to the surface each time it's used to end a life. Glimmering veins of lava flicker from its dark metal surface, and roiling, volcanic sparks trail behind it in its wake when swung.
	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 2d6 fire or lightning damage (your choice) to any target it hits.
	When you reduce a living creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the fire or lightning damage dealt as part of the attack.

Explosive Rage. If you're a barbarian, the first time you enter a rage after finishing a short or long rest, up to 6 creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take 4d6 fire or lightning damage (your choice). In addition, while raging, any creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes 1d6 fire or lightning damage (your choice).

Fiendish Mind. You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal while attuned to this weapon.

Random Properties. Hatred, the Wrathful Edge has the following random properties:

	• 1 minor beneficial property
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 1 minor detrimental property
	• 1 major detrimental property

Volcanic Immunity. You are immune to fire damage while attuned to this weapon. In addition, you can stand on and walk across molten rock as if it were solid ground.

Sentience. Hatred, the Wrathful Edge is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.
	The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common and Infernal.

Personality. The weapon enjoys the sensation of anger. It sees all conflict eventually reaching the same violent conclusion, and encourages its wielder to seek out such hasty and bloody resolutions.

Destroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the axe is to dispel the malevolent spirit within it over time from the Upper Planes. Casting dispel evil and good on the weapon every day for 5 years while on an Upper Plane causes the wrathful spirit within it to eventually succumb and perish. When the spirit leaves the axe, it loses all of its properties except for its bonus to attack and damage rolls, but becomes no harder to destroy than a normal magic weapon.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>This torch-like scepter almost hums with necrotic energy and appeared when the first soul was returned to the Material Plane after its death. Since then, it has been lost and found throughout its gruesome, storied history.
	While attuned to the rod, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and you know the chill touch cantrip as if it were from your class's spell list. If you are a warlock, you also gain a +3 bonus to your spell attack rolls and saving throw DCs of your warlock spells while holding the rod.
	An eerie, green flame erupts from the head of this rod when you hold it, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While holding the rod, you can use a bonus action to mentally snuff out or relight the flames. While the flames are lit, you can use an action to make a ranged spell attack with it, using your spell attack bonus, out to a range of 30 feet. When you do, the flaming rod emits a phantasmal skull that flies out to attack the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. The skull disappears immediately after the attack.

Random Properties. Morath, Scepter of the Soul Vortex has the following random properties:

	• 1 minor beneficial property
	• 1 minor detrimental property
	• 1 major detrimental property

Spells. The rod has 8 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. When you reduce a humanoid to 0 hit points, the rod regains 1 expended charge. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell attack bonus and spell save DC: bestow curse (1 charge), circle of death (4 charges), confusion (2 charges), insect plague (3 charges), ray of enfeeblement (1 charge), or speak with dead (1 charge).

Bestow Greater Curse. When you cast the bestow curse spell while holding the rod using either the rod or a spell slot, you can choose to force the creature to make the saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the target is simultaneously cursed by all four of the spell's listed options. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Death Grip. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast the finger of death spell from it, using your spell save DC. Once the rod has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

Sentience. Morath, Scepter of the Soul Vortex is a sentient chaotic evil rod with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 13, and Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The rod communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common.
	While you are attuned to it, it also understands every language you know. It can choose to communicate with other creatures by manifesting the phantasmal skull above the rod and using it to speak.

Personality. The rod is possessed by Morath, the first human to ever die, and is an independent spirit from within the Thousand Voices, the largest collection of discordant lost souls found within the multiverse. Morath's time on the Material Plane was short, but filled with pain and confusion. As a result, Morath seeks to experience humankind's most base desires vicariously through the actions of the rod's wielder, often attempting to compel the wielder to give in to such urges in moments of weakness.

Curse. The rod bears a curse that affects any non-human that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. When you die while cursed in this way, you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spell save DC. On a failed save, or if the rod is more than 100 feet away from you when you die, your soul is immediately siphoned into and becomes a part of the Thousand Voices, leaving your body a vacant husk and unable to return to life by any means short of a wish spell. On a successful save, your soul leaves your body and enters the rod, as if you had cast the magic jar spell, using the rod as a container. You can only return to your body if it's holding the rod, but can otherwise gain the benefits of the spell as normal. If your soul returns to your body, you return to life with 1 hit point. While your soul is detached from your body in this way, your attunement to the rod is carried over to any other creature you possess for the duration.

Destroying the Scepter. The only way to destroy the rod is to destroy Morath while your soul is contained within the rod. When you do, use your original body's statistics and abilities for your soul, with the exception that your hit point maximum is halved. Use the archmage stat block for Morath's soul. From outside the rod, this combat resolves instantaneously, regardless of how much time passed within the rod during the battle.

If you die while within the rod in this way, your soul is lost to the Thousand Voices. If Morath dies, the rod is destroyed and you return to your body with 1 hit point, regardless of where your body is at the time.

    <text>This ancient staff was created when a piece of driftwood was struck by lightning, fusing it to a twisted length of glass made from the sand on which it laid. Revered by the Rocborne nomads and other worldly travelers, this one-of-a-kind crook carries with it the power of storms, tempests, and the wind spirits that control them. When it appears, it falls from the sky in the eye of a storm or a flash of lightning.
	This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, when you attack with the staff, you can choose to make a special ranged attack with it instead. This attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Wisdom modifier to its attack and damage rolls. On a hit, it deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage as a gust of magical wind batters the target.

Variant Properties. Some properties of this artifact are locked behind layers of dormant magic. As you grow stronger and reach certain milestones, these properties may become available to you. This staff can have up to 3 of the following properties active at a time. When you attune to Nimbus, you can choose to activate up to 3 of its variant properties whose prerequisites you meet.
	Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace any of the activated properties with another one.
	The staff can be used as a broom of flying.

(Prerequisite: 5th level) While holding the staff, you can use a bonus action to cast the shillelagh spell with it.

(Prerequisite: 5th level druid or ranger) The staff gains 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: create or destroy water (1 charge), fog cloud (1 charge), misty step (2 charges), sleet storm (3 charges), or thunderwave (2nd-level version, (2 charges). If you activate another property that causes the staff to gain charges, the total number of charges and regained charges are cumulative.

(Prerequisite: 9th level) Your bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon increases to +2, and the special ranged attack's damage die becomes a d8. When you reach 17th level, the bonus increases to +3, and the ranged attack's damage die becomes a d10.

(Prerequisite: 9th level) The first target hit by the staff on each of your turns takes an extra 1d6 cold, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice).

(Prerequisite: 13th level druid or ranger) The staff gains 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: lightning bolt (3 charges), shatter (2 charges), spirit guardians (3 charges), or wind wall (3 charges). If you activate another property that causes the staff to gain charges, the total number of charges and regained charges are cumulative.

(Prerequisite: 13th level) While holding the staff, you have resistance to cold, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice). When you finish a long rest, you can change this resistance to a different one.

(Prerequisite: 17th level) While holding the staff, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, as wind spirits help usher you forward.

(Prerequisite: 17th level druid or ranger) The staff gains 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: chain lightning (6 charges), cloudkill (5 charges), cone of cold (5 charges), control weather (8 charges), or fly (3 charges, or 6 charges to cast at 6th level). If you activate another property that causes the staff to gain charges, the total number of charges and regained charges are cumulative.

(Prerequisite: 20th level druid or ranger) You gain the benefits of all of this staff's variant properties. In addition, if you are a ranger, you can summon a roc to your location by spending 8 hours performing an ancient Rocborne ritual. The roc is friendly toward you and your companions, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until you dismiss the roc using an action or until the roc dies. If the roc dies, this property can't be used again for 30 days.

Destroying Nimbus. The only way to destroy Nimbus, First Staff of the Thunderbirds is to keep it in a vacuum for 10 years, depriving it of any air, at which point the staff cracks open to release the swirling storm inside it. If the force of the released storm causes the vacuum to end, the storm escapes and continues to rage above that location for 1 year.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This mighty longsword once belonged to Syre, the fey lord of the now fallen Syre Wood. This ancient blade was used to lead the charge against a legion of invading fiends, and still holds a power over such creatures. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse property.
	When you hit a fiend with an attack using this sword, that creature takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage.

Instant Attunement. If you pull Silverwind, the Cleansing Breeze from the body of Malfuriel the Betrayer, you are immediately attuned to it. When this happens, you can choose to immediately end your attunement to one of your other magical items, even if it's cursed (as if by the remove curse spell or similar magic). If you are already attuned to your maximum number of magic items, you must end your attunement to one of them in this way.

Variant Properties. Some properties of this artifact are locked behind layers of dormant magic. As you grow stronger and reach certain milestones, these properties may become available to you. This weapon can have up to 3 of the following properties active at a time. When you attune to Silverwind, up to the first 3 properties available to you are activated. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace any of the activated properties with another one.
	While holding this sword, you can use an action to cast the dancing lights, druidcraft, or minor illusion spell (save DC 13) from the weapon. In addition, when you reach 5th level, you can use a bonus action to cast the true strike spell from it.

(Prerequisite: Fey Ancestry trait or the fey creature type) You are immune to disease.

(Prerequisite: 8th level) Your bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon becomes +2, and any fiend hit by it takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage, instead of 1d6. When you reach 14th level, the bonus increases to +3, and any fiend hit by it takes an extra 3d6 radiant damage instead.

(Prerequisite: 8th level, Fey Ancestry trait or the fey creature type) You can use an action to touch a creature and magically know its current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 16 Charisma saving throw, you also know its alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.

(Prerequisite: 14th level) While holding this sword, you can use a bonus action to create an illusory copy of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. You choose what direction your copy is facing. The copy mimics your movements and attacks with this sword until the end of your turn, moving forward, turning, and attacking to match your actions relative to its position. The copy can't walk through walls or other solid surfaces. The copy uses your attack and damage rolls for any attack you make with this sword, dealing force damage instead of slashing on a hit. The copy vanishes at the end of your turn. If the copy is in an unoccupied space when it vanishes, you can choose to teleport to its space. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

(Prerequisite: 14th level, Fey Ancestry trait or the fey creature type) While this sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell (save DC 16). If you drop the sword, the spell ends.

(Prerequisite: Slay or help slay Malfuriel the Betrayer or similarly powerful fiend) When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be magically restrained until the end of your next turn. If the target is a fiend, it's petrified until the end of your next turn instead.

(Prerequisite: 20th level) You gain the benefits of all of this sword's variant properties, including those whose prerequisites you don't meet.

Destroying Silverwind. The only way to destroy Silverwind, the Cleansing Breeze is to melt it in the fires of the Magmarath Caldera, a raging volcano in the Lower Planes overrun with fiends. It must remain submerged in the magma for 10 years before it succumbs to the fire and is destroyed. When it does, the volcano erupts.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>These leather bags have the stylized face of a griffon on their front and appear across the multiverse in strange locations. One may be found in the belly of a dragon, while another in the limbs of a great tree. Regardless of where it's found, a Griffon's Saddlebag is typically discovered by an adventurer with a destiny.
	The saddlebags are made by a great, six-armed griffon on the Astral Plane. Believed by some to be a demigod of pocket dimensions and craftsmen everywhere, the griffon is a patron of artificers and creators across the multiverse. The griffon creates magical items in its great forge using materials collected from various planes of existence to add to its collection. While no one knows exactly how to contact the griffon, it has a knack for knowing what items are needed by whom.

Superior Holding. This 1-foot-wide bag always weighs 3 pounds, regardless of what's inside it. It functions as a bag of holding that can only be pierced by another artifact. Placing a bag of holding, handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item inside the extradimensional space created by the saddlebag, or vice versa, destroys the extradimensional item but leaves the saddlebag unharmed. Any item stored within the other extradimensional space is magically moved to the space within the saddlebag instead. If doing so overloads the bag, random contents from either space are scattered in the Astral Plane.

Magic Courier. At the GM's discretion, the saddlebag's beak opens up to reveal a letter. The magical script can be read by all creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. The note is a delivery request or similar that includes the name of an item as well as either specific or vague descriptions of a person or place. At the bottom of the letter is a price listed in coins or other form of payment, as well as a date or time depending on its urgency.
	If the saddlebag is brought to the described person or place within the allotted time, it dispenses the magical item into the hand of the appropriate recipient. If the payment isn't received by the bag within 1 hour of dispensing the magic item, the item vanishes and is lost.
	After receiving the payment for an item in this way, the bag's beak reopens to dispense a reward for the courier.

Sell Magic Items. The saddlebag has a connection to the griffon's forge on the Astral Plane. Depending on the magic item, you can sell a magic item to the saddlebag for half the cost of its base price.

Spells. The saddlebag has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the saddlebag, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it: detect magic (1 charge), identify (1 charge), or legend lore (5 charges).

Additional Spells. At the GM's discretion, such as after reaching certain milestones or completing Magic Courier quests, the saddlebag may offer the following additional spells that can be cast from it: blink (3 charges), dimension door (4 charges), divination (4 charges), etherealness (7 charges), fly (3 charges), magnificent mansion (7 charges), plane shift (7 charges), or secret chest (4 charges).

Sentience. The saddlebag is a sentient chaotic neutral bag with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The bag can speak, read, and understand Common. When in the presence of only creatures it trusts, the bag's beak moves when it speaks. Otherwise, the bag communicates telepathically with its wearer. The bag can speak and communicate with griffons.

Personality. The bag's purpose is to carry, collect, and deliver magic items. Different bags have different personalities, but they are for the most part largely pleasant to talk to. Their voices are bird-like and are filled with occasional coos and squawks, and their stitched eyes widen, squint, and move expressively.
	If the bag's wearer or allies fail to fulfill Magic Courier quests, it may stop offering its magic to them. If it does, their items may be lost or inaccessible within the bag, or potentially spat out. While the bag provides the names of item recipients and delivery locations, it doesn't know any more information than what was provided to it by the astral griffon. Regardless, it does its best to help its wearer and allies find the specified person or location on the letter.

Destroying the Griffon's Saddlebag. While there is no way to permanently destroy the saddlebag, piercing it with an artifact returns it to its place of origin for repair before it's returned to the multiverse in a new location. Placing a Griffon's Saddlebag inside the extradimensional space created by another Griffon's Saddlebag returns both items to their place of origin and sends all the items stored within them to the griffon's forge on the Astral Plane.
