    <text>Ammo: arrow

This metallic bow resembles the shape of a mighty cobra and is covered in spots of patina. When you fire an arrow from the bow, you can choose to coat the arrow in a thin layer of acid. A target hit with the acid-coated arrow takes an extra 1d4 acid damage. Hit or miss, a nonmagical coated arrow is destroyed after the attack.
	In addition, the bow has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the Attack action using this bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to replace one of your weapon attacks with a special attack. This special attack duplicates the effect of the acid arrow spell and uses the same attack bonus as your normal weapon attacks with the bow.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>Ammo: arrow

This gilded bow creates hazy illusions of the cosmos when drawn. Attacks made with this magic bow deal an extra 1d4 force damage to any target hit by it.
	When you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you while holding this bow, you can use your reaction to draw from your own life force and attempt to counter it. When you do, you take 30 force damage, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way, and fire a magical arrow of pure force from the bow toward the creature. If the creature is casting a spell of 5th level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. In addition, the target must make a DC 16 saving throw, using its spellcasting ability. On a failed save, the creature takes 30 force damage as the magic is ripped from it. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much force damage. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

This bow balances the positive and negative magics from the upper and lower planes of existence. Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with the bow as part of the Attack action, you can channel either positive or negative energy into the attack.
	When you do, you take a –5 penalty to the attack roll. If you channeled positive energy into the attack and hit, the target takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against it by a creature other than you before the start of your next turn has advantage. If you channeled negative energy into the attack, the target takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage, and the next attack roll the target makes before the end of your next turn has disadvantage.

    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt

Wrought from metal in the likeness of a brazier, this ranged weapon's grip has been covered in wax and has a simple candle positioned in front of where the arrow or bolt is fired from. The candle is magic and never runs out of wax, nor can it be removed from the weapon. You can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's command word to cause the candle to light itself, shedding light like a normal candle while ablaze. While the candle is lit, this magic weapon deals an extra 2 fire damage to any target it hits with a ranged attack. The candle's flame lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.
	If you roll the same number on both d20s when you make a ranged attack roll with advantage or disadvantage using this weapon while its candle is lit, the ammunition becomes wreathed in a conflagration of uncontrollable flames. The arrow or bolt flies toward the target and explodes, destroying the ammunition and dealing 4d6 fire damage to the target (instead of the attack's normal damage), or half as much damage if the total of the attack roll was less than the target's AC. This fire ignites flammable objects within 5 feet of the target that aren't being worn or carried. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: simple, shortbow

	• The creature gains a +1 bonus AC.
	• The creature can breathe air and water.
	• The creature gains a swimming speed equal to its walking or flying speed, whichever is higher.

If the weapon is a greatsword, Small creatures don't make attack rolls with disadvantage using this weapon as a result of its heavy property. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage to any target it hits.
	While holding the weapon, you can use a bonus action to magically store it in a special extradimensional space. While the weapon is stored in this space, you can use a bonus action to magically retrieve it again, causing the weapon to reappear in your hand. If the sword is ever more than 30 feet away from you, it magically vanishes into the space on its own.
	When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 3d8 radiant damage, and if the target is a creature, it is incapacitated and banished to a special demiplane until the start of your next turn, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. On a successful save, the target takes half as much radiant damage and isn't incapacitated or transported. If you are a cleric or paladin, you and each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to half the radiant damage dealt in this way.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>This magic weapon exerts dominance over certain creatures and was crafted by a culture known for its hunting and battling of monsters.
	This sword has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. As a reaction when you reduce a Large or smaller beast or monstrosity of challenge rating 3 or lower to 0 hit points with this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to try and capture it instead. The creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it disappears and is contained within the sword with 1 hit point. On a success, it resists the effect and falls to 0 hit points. Shapechangers automatically succeed on the saving throw. Only one creature can be captured by the sword at any time.
	As an action while holding the sword, you can speak its command phrase to release the stored creature. It reappears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The GM has the creature's statistics. The creature returns to the sword after 1 minute if you're within 100 feet of it, or earlier if you touch the creature with the sword as an action. The creature ceases to be friendly to you and your companions if it's unable to return to the sword, or if you release control of it using a bonus action, or if it takes damage from you or an ally.
	While you're holding the sword and the creature is stored within it or within 30 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's command word and expend 1 or more of its charges to restore 10 hit points to that creature for each charge spent. A captured creature can only regain hit points in this way.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

	This sword has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn.

    <text>This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.

This naturally-sourced armor is interwoven with fibers and caps from a resilient strain of violet fungus that grows when exposed to rejuvenating magic. While wearing this armor, your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and whenever a spell or magical effect causes you to regain hit points, you also gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the number of hit points you recover, up to a maximum of 15 temporary hit points. While you have temporary hit points in this way, you also have resistance to necrotic damage.

Curse: Once you don and attune to this magic armor, you can't doff it unless you die or are targeted by the remove curse spell: a side effect of the violet fungus' magical and parasitic effects. When your attunement to the armor ends, your Constitution score is reduced by 2 (to a minimum score of 1) until 2d6 + 6 days have passed or until you attune to the armor again.

    <text>This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

Novanite is a strong metal smelt from ore mined in the Astral Plane. Armor made from this metal absorbs more light than normal and gives off a strange, otherworldly aura. Glimmering cosmos can be seen in the armor's reflections at night. You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

Astral Leap: While wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to choose a space you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, you vanish into a planar tear and reappear at the chosen spot at the start of your next turn, remaining in the Astral plane until you do. If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you take 3d6 force damage and appear in the nearest unoccupied space. This property of the armor can't be used again until 12 hours have passed.
	Disappearing and reappearing in this way creates vacuums and waves as space is pushed and pulled around you. Other creatures within 10 feet of you when you vanish or reappear must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and is pulled up to 10 feet toward the space you left from, or pushed 10 feet away from the space you reappear in. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much force damage and is not pulled or pushed.

    <text>This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

Novanite is a strong metal smelt from ore mined in the Astral Plane. Armor made from this metal absorbs more light than normal and gives off a strange, otherworldly aura. Glimmering cosmos can be seen in the armor's reflections at night. You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.

Astral Leap: While wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to choose a space you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, you vanish into a planar tear and reappear at the chosen spot at the start of your next turn, remaining in the Astral plane until you do. If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you take 3d6 force damage and appear in the nearest unoccupied space. This property of the armor can't be used again until 12 hours have passed.
	Disappearing and reappearing in this way creates vacuums and waves as space is pushed and pulled around you. Other creatures within 10 feet of you when you vanish or reappear must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and is pulled up to 10 feet toward the space you left from, or pushed 10 feet away from the space you reappear in. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much force damage and is not pulled or pushed.

The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.

    <text>Ammo: arrow

This flexible bow is made from the chitinous legs of a phase spider and retains some of its ethereal properties. When you hit with a ranged attack using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d4 force damage.
	The bow has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack with this bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the arrow to slip partially into the Ethereal Plane. When you do, the target of the attack gains no benefit from cover, including total cover, as long as the cover isn't made of lead or more than 1 foot thick. If you hit, the target takes an extra 3d4 force damage. Any effect that blocks travel through the Ethereal Plane also blocks the arrow.
	Alternatively, you can speak the bow's command word as a bonus action to expend 3 of its charges and fire an arrow at a point you can see within the weapon's normal range. When the arrow hits a solid surface, you vanish from your location and reappear in an unoccupied space nearest to that point.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Proficiency: martial, longbow

    <text>This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.

This black and yellow armor has a billowing plume of soft fur around its neck and chest. Draped over its shoulders is a scalloped cape that's split into two translucent, wing-like ends.
	The armor has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can expend 1 of its charges (no action required) to activate the cape, transforming it into a pair of insect-like wings for 1 hour. For the duration of the wings, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover.

Beekeeper's Commitment: While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the armor regains all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of 1d3, and gains the following benefit:

Pollinator: While the armor's cape is transformed, it releases a sparkling mist of enchanting pollen. For the duration, any insect or plant creature that targets you with an attack or harmful spell must first make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.

    <text>This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

This armor is covered by a tabard that bears a cross-like symbol with an arrow at its top. While attuned to the armor, its symbol changes to represent the mark of your deity. You can benefit from the armor, as described below, even if you aren't attuned to it.
	While wearing this armor, you have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks, and you can use a bonus action to speak the armor's command word and touch a dying creature to magically stabilize them.
	While attuned to this armor and wearing it, you can use a bonus action to cast the spiritual weapon spell from it, using a spell attack bonus of +5 and spellcasting ability modifier of +2. This version of the spell causes the summoned weapon to take the form of a bow that shares your space and moves with you, as opposed to moving independently. The bow makes ranged spell attacks, instead of melee ones, with spectral arrows that have a range of 30 feet. Once the armor has been used to cast this spell, it can't cast it again until the next dawn. Additionally, when you stabilize a creature using this armor's command word, roll a d20. On a 20, the creature regains 1 hit point.

Curse: This armor is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell. While cursed, your legs magically change shape to become hooved and equine, unless they already are, and you take a –5 penalty to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In addition, while cursed, the distance you can jump without a running start is halved.

    <text>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.

This armor is covered by a tabard that bears a cross-like symbol with an arrow at its top. While attuned to the armor, its symbol changes to represent the mark of your deity. You can benefit from the armor, as described below, even if you aren't attuned to it.
	While wearing this armor, you have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks, and you can use a bonus action to speak the armor's command word and touch a dying creature to magically stabilize them.
	While attuned to this armor and wearing it, you can use a bonus action to cast the spiritual weapon spell from it, using a spell attack bonus of +5 and spellcasting ability modifier of +2. This version of the spell causes the summoned weapon to take the form of a bow that shares your space and moves with you, as opposed to moving independently. The bow makes ranged spell attacks, instead of melee ones, with spectral arrows that have a range of 30 feet. Once the armor has been used to cast this spell, it can't cast it again until the next dawn. Additionally, when you stabilize a creature using this armor's command word, roll a d20. On a 20, the creature regains 1 hit point.

Curse: This armor is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell. While cursed, your legs magically change shape to become hooved and equine, unless they already are, and you take a –5 penalty to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In addition, while cursed, the distance you can jump without a running start is halved.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, handaxe

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

When you take the Attack action using this axe, you can forgo one of your attacks to swing the axe in front of you and speak its command word. When you do, the axe emits a crashing wave of magical water. The wave is 10 feet tall and extends from you in a 30-foot cone, after which it spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in the area within 30 feet of it before the water vanishes. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>These polished wooden weapons are traditionally used by the clerics and paladins of a righteous order to punish evildoers and aid the needy. Each of these magic weapons is blessed by a powerful priest or celestial. A weapon of verdict has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn. You can use these charges to create the following effects:

Condemn: When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target.

Commend: As an action, you can expend 1 charge to touch a creature other than yourself with this weapon to restore 1d8 + 2 hit points to that creature.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

This 8-armed bow uses the remains of a spindly spider's legs and maw. The bow has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack with the bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to lace it with sticky spider silk. On a hit, the arrow magically sheds the silk and releases it as a net-like web. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it and each Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained until the end of your next turn. If the target is a Large creature, only it must succeed on the saving throw instead. Huge and larger creatures are unaffected by the web.

Summon Spiders: While holding the weapon, you can use an action to speak its command word to summon 2 swarms of insects (spiders) or 1 giant spider, which appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 10 feet of you. The GM has the creatures' statistics. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, after 1 hour, or when you end the effect early as a bonus action. Once this property of the bow has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    <text>These magic weapons were forged with lightweight metals and designed for speed rather than brute force. Whirling weapons have the finesse and light properties and whistle softly when swung through the air. When you take the Attack action and attack with a whirling weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make another attack with the same weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you're holding a different whirling weapon in each hand and engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make one attack with each weapon when you use a bonus action in this way.
	In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attacks.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

This burnt yellow armor is the mark of a royal scout. Its magical construction is unyielding to all but the most lithe and capable of scouts and huntsmen.
	While wearing the armor, you gain a +5 bonus to any Dexterity (Stealth) check you make. While you have more than half your Hit Dice remaining, you can choose to expend 2 of them as an action to extend this property to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you for 1 hour. When you do, each affected creature, including yourself, has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature only benefits from this effect if it remains within 30 feet of you.
	The armor has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to use one of the following properties:

"At Arrow's Length!": When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you uses its reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the armor's charges to summon a spectral arrow from the air above it. The arrow flies harmlessly in front of the attacking creature and disappears, distracting them from the attack and causing the roll to be made with disadvantage. If the attacking creature has blindsight, this property has no effect. If you're concentrating on the hunter's mark spell, you can choose to move your mark to this creature as part of your reaction.
	Alternatively, if a hostile creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to immediately move up to half your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.

"From Sky to Earth!": As an action, you can expend 4 charges from the armor to summon a volley of spectral arrows from the sky, choosing a point that you can see within 120 feet of you when you do. The arrows fall in a 30-foot radius, 60-foot high cylinder centered on that point and then disappear. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

"There Is No Escape!": You can use a bonus action to expend up to 3 of the armor's charges to cast the hunter's mark spell from it. If you choose to expend 2 charges, you cast the spell at 3rd level, or 5th level if you choose to expend 3.

Flaw: The Yellow Harbinger's path compels its wearer to be cautious and over-prepared. While attuned to the armor, you gain the following flaw: "I am duty-bound to lay out the perfect plan for every situation. Uncertainty is unacceptable." In addition, if you are attuned to the armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or your GM determine who this person is. You consider this person your field commander and put their plans ahead of your own and trust them implicitly. You can't attune to the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise. If you're already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your field commander, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the Red Queen's burden or Violet King's promise without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the armor.

    <text>This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.

"There Is No Escape!": You can use a bonus action to expend up to 3 of the armor's charges to cast the hunter's mark spell from it. If you choose to expend 2 charges, you cast the spell at 3rd level, or 5th level if you choose to expend 3.

Flaw: The Yellow Harbinger's path compels its wearer to be cautious and over-prepared. While attuned to the armor, you gain the following flaw: "I am duty-bound to lay out the perfect plan for every situation. Uncertainty is unacceptable." In addition, if you are attuned to the armor for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty extends to the person you trust most. You or your GM determine who this person is. You consider this person your field commander and put their plans ahead of your own and trust them implicitly. You can't attune to the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise. If you're already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to either of these weapons becomes your field commander, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the Red Queen's burden or Violet King's promise without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the armor.

    <text>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.

This burnt yellow armor is the mark of a royal scout. Its magical construction is unyielding to all but the most lithe and capable of scouts and huntsmen.
	While wearing the armor, you gain a +5 bonus to any Dexterity (Stealth) check you make. While you have more than half your Hit Dice remaining, you can choose to expend 2 of them as an action to extend this property to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you for 1 hour. When you do, each affected creature, including yourself, has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature only benefits from this effect if it remains within 30 feet of you.
	The armor has 7 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to use one of the following properties:

"At Arrow's Length!": When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you uses its reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the armor's charges to summon a spectral arrow from the air above it. The arrow flies harmlessly in front of the attacking creature and disappears, distracting them from the attack and causing the roll to be made with disadvantage. If the attacking creature has blindsight, this property has no effect. If you're concentrating on the hunter's mark spell, you can choose to move your mark to this creature as part of your reaction.
	Alternatively, if a hostile creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend 2 charges to immediately move up to half your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.

"From Sky to Earth!": As an action, you can expend 4 charges from the armor to summon a volley of spectral arrows from the sky, choosing a point that you can see within 120 feet of you when you do. The arrows fall in a 30-foot radius, 60-foot high cylinder centered on that point and then disappear. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

"There Is No Escape!": You can use a bonus action to expend up to 3 of the armor's charges to cast the hunter's mark spell from it. If you choose to expend 2 charges, you cast the spell at 3rd level, or 5th level if you choose to expend 3.
