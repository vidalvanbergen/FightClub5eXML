    <description>Kaybella is an old and experienced elf who has gained both of those traits by being cutthroat in an economic and literal sense. it is her cunning wit and iron fist that have allowed the Cartographer's Guild to rise to its current prominence without having their adventure-farming venture discovered. Most of the loot and treasure from those ventures are sold or put to use by other members of the guild, but the Cartoghrapher keeps a few tricks up her sleeve.

    <description>Chantelle Redcliff, as the current Guildmaster of The Mercantile Guild, is accurately described as the
most influential and powerful person in Antronec. The resources at her command within Antronec's
government branches and underbelly are considerable, and she is more than willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that her guild retains its control over the city. She is exceptionally resourceful, and not to be underestimated—she has risen to her current role by proving herself the most capable politician and mage in The Mercantile Guild.

    <description>In Antronec's sewers, these vile monstrosities roam, relishing in the abundance of waste and smaller prey. Some researchers presume that this unholy mixture of dung beetle and centipede was created by a mage or deity striving to inspire nightmares. It is uniquely adept at navigating the underground and often-poisonous sewer system, as many adventurers have discovered. In fact, some adventuring agencies consider slaying a scarapit to be the deciding factor between an adventurer and a thrill-seeker.

    <description>Out of all the strange plants across the Material Plane, perhaps the most insidious among them is the seed coin. Taking the appearance of a humble copper piece, or occasionally a silver, they easily pass from hand to hand in marketplaces. When they take root, they develop into their second stage of growth, infested pollinators that only appear human. These walking 'flowers' latch onto and collectively build the third stage, a germination stall, which coordinates the coins and pollinators to further expand their reach.

    <description>Once a seed coin has fully taken root in its host's mind, it begins to burrow into their flesh. From there, it begins to expand its vines through the veins of the deceased creature, utilizing the abundant moisture, nutrients, and direct access to the body's brain and lungs. Once it has spread, it puppets the form with these vines, though the bulk of it resides in the unmoving lungs and skull cavity.

This rapid growth strengthens the body's cell walls, making them heardier and more plant-like below the skin's surface. The appearance changes little, but the pollinator is most certainly a plant and not a humanoid.

A creature restrained by the vines can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check, freeing itself on a success. These vines disappear if the stall dies, or if it uses the action again.

    <description>It's not entirely clear how seed coin pollinators manage to coalesce and combine into a germination stall, as it's never been witnessed directly. What has been recorded is that by all indications, a germination stall looks like almost every other merchant stall around it. They often have their own quirks, based on the appearance of their staff members, which are their pollinators. They rarely make any sales, as their inventory seems deliberately unappealing. Instead, the pollinators channel energy from the stall to produce seed coins which can be slipped into pockets, left on the street, or offered as alms to the poor.

Those unlucky enough to draw a bloodmire treant's ire will face all of nature's wrath as well as the foul blood magic of Malfuriel, as these cursed treants possess the ability to animate pools of bloodwater into ooze-like forms as an additional means of defense.

    <description>The Crimson Legionnaires are a swift, decisive, and efficient unit of infantry. In stark contrast to typical imps, Crimson Legion imps are zealous and obedient followers, known throughout the Lower Planes for their stubborn devotion to Malfuriel. With invisibility and silvered tongues, the art of war is second nature to them, and ensures that any battlefield conflict is skewed in their favor. They make frequent use of their shapechanging, becoming rats, hawks, and centipedes in order to scout, spy, or conceal their true numbers.

Made larger by fiendish blood magic, these imps are otherwise similar in appearance to their lesser brethren. Red skin in various shades, poison-dripping scorpion tail, bat-like wings and unique patterns of horns upon their heads all serve as identifying features.

    <description>With translucent red skin, the giant blood eels of the Bloodmire are nearly impossible to detect as they traverse the deep pools of bloodwater. Naturalists are unsure of exactly how the eels came to dwell in the swamp, but attempts to research them more fully or retrieve a specimen has resulted in numerous vanished expeditions.

    <description>Empowered by the sheer volume of slow-moving blood present in the swampland formerly known as the Syre Wood, giant mosquitoes are a constant threat to travelers and denizens alike. The mosquitoes are one of the most frequent carriers of disease and with their size and numbers are capable of tremendous damage.

Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space of its choice outside the stream. On a failed save, the creature falls into the stream and takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. A creature that starts its turn in the stream must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become diseased (see the Bloodmire Diseases table).

- A pillar of unholy flame bursts from the ground. Each creature in a 5-foot radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point Malfuriel chooses within 60 feet of him must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
    </legendary>
    <description>Malfuriel was once an ardent enforcer of the heavens: charged with punishing bigots and heretics. But time's passing led him to take satisfaction—then pleasure— from inflicting pain. He became a sadistic torturer and was exiled from the Upper Planes: a fallen planetar.

When the forces of hell offered him the opportunity to lead a legion and inflict wanton suffering on his choice of targets, Malfuriel accepted the bargain, becoming a devil in the process. After several successful campaigns of slaughter and torture, Malfuriel's Crimson Legion became a renowned and unstoppable force of destruction. With bruised, pale green skin and a multitude of open cuts slowly oozing blood, Malfuriel's hulking form is appropriately intimidating and only subtly recognizable as once angelic. His once white-feathered wings are now stained and dripping crimson. Freed from Syre's cursed blade, his boundless fury is free once more to raze all opposition.

    <description>Druids of the Circle of Dragons typically take a supportive role while in combat, utilizing their spells to heal and empower their allies. However, if they become injured or face a truly imminent threat, they will wild shape into their powerful draconic form and unleash their full might with tremendous fervor.

These special druids are labeled in ascending order below by their strength and ranking within the Order.

      <text>The druid can use its action to magically polymorph into a Medium Dragon of any type of its choice (see the Dragon Damage Type table), or back into its humanoid form. When the druid polymorphs, it gains 120 temporary hit points, and it can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground, melds into its new form, or is worn by the new form (if possible). It reverts to its humanoid form after 6 hours, if it dies, or if it falls unconscious. Its statistics are the same in each form, other than its AC and speed, as noted.

When determining what dragon color and damage type a Crest City druid or similar creature should use when they use their Change Shape ability, use the table below.

Dragon - Damage Type
Black - Acid
Blue - Lightning
Brass - Fire
Bronze - Lightning
Copper - Acid
Dragon - Damage
Gold - Fire
Green - Poison
Red - Fire
Silver - Cold
White - Cold

    <description>Beneath a facade of haphazard scribblings and windswept hair, Vincent is a shrewd negotiator and keen observer. He is quite diligent in collecting and protecting the Circle's secrets, as well as keeping an eye out for potentially talented recruits.

While typically affable, the rare occasions that unleash his true temper and draconic might have rightfully earned him the nickname "Book Wyrm" amongst the Circle.

The wall is 20 feet high and blocks line of sight. Each creature in the area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 63 (14d8) piercing damage and is restrained in the wall. On a successful save, the creatures takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

The wall remains until the end of Lothrem's next turn, at which point it withers and disappears. A creature restrained in the wall or one that is within 5 feet of the creature can use its action to make a DC 19 Strength check, freeing the creature on a success. For the duration, the area is difficult terrain, and when a creatures moves into or within the area, it takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.</text>

      <name>Lair Actions</name>
      <text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Lothrem takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects: 
- Each creature of Lothrem's choice within 60 feet of them gains the effect of the sanctuary spell. This effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
- Lothrem casts wind wall, without material components. 
- Lothrem chooses a point on the ground that they can see within 120 feet of them, causing grasping weeds and vines to sprout from the ground in a 30-foot radius centered on that point. For 1 minute, the area is under the effects of the entangle spell. This effect ends early if Lothrem uses this lair action again or if they die.</text>
    </legendary>
    <legendary category="lair">
      <name>Regional Effects</name>
      <text>The region containing Lothrem's lair is warped by their draconic magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Each creature that has the ability to cast at least one spell can cast the druidcraft cantrip at will while within 6 miles of Lothrem's lair.
- The weather within 6 miles of the lair is substantially affected by Lothrem's current state of mind (see Lothrem's Mood &amp; Weather table).

Ivy and other vines are prevalent on stone structures within 1 mile of Lothrem's lair, reinforcing the structures and protecting them against the elements. In addition, while Lothrem is within their lair, grass and flowers continously growth underneath them, as if under the effects of the druidcraft spell.</text>
    </legendary>
    <description>Initially a frightened and orphaned hatchling, Lothrem has grown in a curious manner. Now a full-sized and fully capable ancient dragon, their wisdom and natural magic are mighty indeed, shaping their appearance and the very weather above their hidden Warrens lair.

More in tune with nature than a typical gold dragon, Lothrem has verdant green scales, and grass and flowers grow from their back and the outside of their wings. 

They have elk-like antlers that wrap around their head, seeming to form a natural and regal crown. When they beat their wings, the air smells sweet like a forest glen, and bits of leaves and grass swirl about. 

Unfortunately, the years of protection and isolation have not been kind to Lothrem, and for the last 500 years, they have been overcome with a bout of sadness and acute pain each day, resulting in a consistent drizzling rainfall above. Perhaps release, even a temporary one, from this gilded cage would resolve the matter, but the Circle is unwilling to break tradition and endanger the city.

This smoky black carriage pulled by horses dark as midnight is one with its headless driver. Within the carriage are countless wailing souls, but their screams go unheard. The legends claim that seeing the coach is to court misfortune, and hearing your name uttered by the coachman is an instant death sentence, as he instructs you to board the carriage with the other
damned passengers. 

Undead Nature. A death coach doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Those who have only recently begun to follow the teachings of Attiskin are referred to as initiates. These individuals have begun to open their eyes to the wonders and dangers of the Ethereal, but they are only fledglings. Some of these inexperienced monks feel the call to Walk the Liminal Path earlier than is typical—these brave souls are destined to accomplish greatness or fall to tragedy.

    <description>When Durheim monks have honed their soul to the point where the Walking the Liminal Path is the next stage of their destiny, they begin their journey as Guides.

Along the Path, they travel across the land and dutifully seek out struggling spirits. When they feel the time is right, they return to record their experiences. As the main body of the Monastery's membership, Guides are often someone's first introduction to the Order.

In this role, they give lectures and interpretations of Lightseer Attiskin's teachings and philosophies, and ensure that both the living and the dead can walk their respective paths safely.

The lightseer's gaze is a precious and heavily guarded artifact within Durheim Monastery, originally worn by Lightseer Attiskin. He left explicit provision that only in times of dire need should the mantle of Lightseer be taken up. Wearing the lightseer's gaze causes blindness, but the stars and celestial bodies in the heavens are still visible. The mysterious item also rewrites the Lightseer's history, forcing the bearer to select a new name—only the bearer is aware that they ever had a different name.

    <description>In pursuit of knowledge or power, occasionally the soul of a chromatic dragon will accidentally or willfully ascend from its mortal trappings to terrorize the Ethereal Plane. Most often, a slain dragon will follow a pattern similar to other mortal creatures, becoming so consumed by the desire for vengeance that their incorporeal essence lingers. These vicious creatures are not to be underestimated upon observing their single-minded fury, for their bone-chilling breath weapon and
life-sapping melee onslaught are truly formidable.

    <description>When an eminently-wrathful soul is murdered within view of a mirror, it can sometimes become trapped within. This haunted reflection can only interact with the material plane in a very limited fashion, but is dangerous nonetheless. With concentrated rage as it's weapon, it hunts those that it deems undeserving of life, that still possess the joy it no longer can. Those who wish to confront a reflection should be especially wary of using magic against it, lest they find themselves suffering from the rebounded spell. They should also take care to destroy other reflective surfaces nearby, lest
it escape.

    <description>These swirling and frothy, caramel-colored creatures smell of honey and hops. The existence of ale elementals has brought about hours of intense research and debate about the possibility of an elemental plane of alcohol or the like. Planar travel has thus far proved impossible, although these elementals are occasionally summoned by inebriated mages purposefully or accidentally. Regardless of their means of arrival, these creatures swarm towards areas with high concentrations of alcoholic beverages. As they pursue their murky agendas, they usually end up causing terrible havoc and general mayhem.

The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time.

A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a creature or object out of it by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check and succeeding. Any levels of drunkenness caused by this effect go away when the grapple ends.</text>

    <description>Taking the form of bubbling liquids of various colors, wine elementals are a more potent and rare version of the ale elemental. More intelligent and attuned to nature than their fellows, their appearance is usually in reaction to the destruction of nature. Bacchanalian parties that damage the environment often attract their ire, resulting in many party-goers getting far more than they reckoned. Whatever their perceived or actual motivations, these elementals are a formidable force and especially dangerous for those with a low tolerance for alcohol.

    <description>A small and yet pernicious ooze, the purple jam looks like a mushy globule of smashed grapes or dark berries. They mindlessly consume plantlife, leading some to speculate that they originated from a goodberry spell gone wrong. Their wanderings often lead them to spaces like taverns where their natural camouflage is uniquely suited, and food is plentiful. A persistent creature, it's surprisingly difficult to destroy—especially for the type of magical practitioners typically found in the small towns and cities they prefer.

    <description>Although most mimics are known for their ability to transform into innocuous items, mimic kegs are a
particular cousin that transform solely into alcohol-related objects. Scholars believe that long-term
exposure to alcoholic drinks gradually morphed a number of ancient mimics into this unique breed. Most mimics are ambush predators, but mimic kegs are particularly patient hunters. When plagued by these monsters, some taverns develop an almost religious inventory system to ensure their mugs, jugs, and kegs are safe for customers.

A vicious scavenger, it is willing to stalk living prey when the pickings are slim. In this instance, it shows a terrifying ability to rapidly putrefy organic material with its talons.

Each time the tipsy or its allies ask the target a question, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts for 1 hour or until the tipsy dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If the target successfully saves against the effect or the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this tipsy's Charm for the next 24 hours.

    <description>Most fey on the Material Plane take abundant joy in the manipulation of mortals and instigation of drama, but the tipsy in particular delights in the chaos of drunken romance. These small, pastel-colored fey flutter around bars to cause mischief. The tipsy can use its subtle magic to encourage confession of true feelings and impulsive action, whether they are long-repressed or new temptations. Invisible to sober patrons, they whisper sweet nothings and bold encouragement as necessary, then watch the scene unfold. Softened by inebriation, individuals find themselves unwitting participants, unable to smother the truth any longer.

    <description>While most plants within a grymclover forest can pose an ample threat to the unwary, archer flowers are notoriously dangerous. They grow parasitically on tree roots, with budding flowers aimed at the canopy. Doing so ensures that climbing or flying creatures can be knocked down by their highly caustic spit; landing directly into their flytrap-like maws.

These large plant creatures use their thorny vines to pierce and ensnare their prey, piercing and suffocating them into submission.

To make matters worse, paralyzing, toxic barbs grow on the tongues of these creatures, which they use as debilitating projectiles. For obvious reasons, the cloverback toad's acidic mucus and toxic barbs are also sought-after ingredients for use in deadly poisons.

Concentrated necrotic magic resides in the singular eye of a cyglops, which can be released as a focused beam of destructive force.

    <description>Hapless adventurers that meet their untimely end in a corrupted forest sometimes return as a geleton: a symbiotic, collective lifeform between ooze and skeleton. Of such geletons, most can probably be found in the dungeons and ruins of these forests.

As such, a geleton adventurer usually develops an almost preternatural ability to detect traps and defend themselves.

    <description>Taking the form of a harmless rabbit or hare, the creature known as a grymhare is actually a nightmarish aberration in disguise. Its true form resembles an oily cephalopod, whose far-reaching tentacle strikes are capable of lashing out against numerous targets at once. Although grymhares take their name from the grymclover forests in which they frequent, other reports suggest that these creatures are simply drawn to the corruptive magic there, rather than being a gruesome mutation of it.

When a creature becomes charmed by this effect, apply one of the effects below at random for as long as the creature remains charmed.

1. Hazy Sight. The creature is unable to see with any definition further than 10 feet from itself. The affected creature is considered to be blinded to any creature or object further than 10 feet from itself, as they appear to it only as blurry, amorphous blobs of color.

2. Confusion. The creature suffers the effects of the confusion spell, though the psybird doesn't need to maintain concentration on it. The affected creature can repeat its save at the end of each of its turns, ending the charm on itself on a success.

3. Stupefaction. The creature suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks it makes that use either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. The creature also temporarily forgets any languages it knows except for the one it has known the longest.

4. Dizziness. Any turn in combat during which the creature uses more than half of its movement speed, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone. Each time this happens, the creature can repeat its save, ending the effect on a success.</text>

    <description>When a grymclover forest mutates birds, they usually mutate into psybirds. These avian monstrosities grow remarkable and varied plumage, which they use to hypnotize their prey after luring them in with telepathic cries of pain and suffering. Individual psybirds will sometimes flock together in small groups (called nightmares), but scholars suspect that if enough were to ever
band together as a larger, permanent flock, the resulting carnage would be devastating.

    <description>With the head of a moose, body and wings of a raptor, alcetons wander the frigid skies of northern climes and the upper echelons of snow-topped mountain ranges. Their favored prey are humanoids, especially dwarves. Indeed, some dwarven legends (especially in Heavensteppe) claim that roving alcetons are one of the foremost reasons dwarves belong below the surface.

    <description>Found most often burrowing through the igneous rock of dormant, active, or extinct volcanoes, the lava wurm is a ferocious draconic creature that lives off the rock they tunnel through. Although highly dangerous, the movements of lava wurms are followed as closely as possible by smiths who value them as natural smelters of the volcanic rock. The wurm can expel the undigested, molten metal from their gullet when threatened or expel it as the highly sought-after slag leavings.

    <description>Occasionally, a lava wurm will live long enough and grow their vestigial wings large enough to become an elder. These creatures are an order of magnitude more dangerous than the young wurms, as their small but now functional wings allow them to more readily and swiftly follow their prey through molten rock and the open air. With their sheer bulk and love for fine granite,
elder lava wurms are an infrequent but greatly feared invader of Heavensteppe, usually requiring many Steel Hawk lives to drive away.

    <description>Experienced members of the Steel Hawks receive the rank of captain, typically signified by their receipt of a silver eagle weapon of their choice. With numerous battles and investigations under their belts, captains lead their platoons with valor and honor. Indeed, most captains lead their soldiers from the front line of battle, demonstrating the true prowess of a Steel Hawk in flight.

    <description>Giant antlions are the kinds of creatures that inspire nightmares. Like their smaller relatives, giant antlions hide in sand or other loose earth, and wait to ambush hapless passersby with their deadly jaws, which resemble a massive, chitinous bear trap.

Desert Trappers. Once it has found a suitable location, an antlion will then set its trap. Juvenile and adult antlions will even dig a steep, conical pit lined with loose sand, creating a hazard that prey can easily slip and tumble down, rolling directly into the beast's waiting jaws.

H'rethi Specimens. In stark contrast to other regions, giant antlions of the H'rethi Desert seem to roam the dunes and dig their traps by night, resulting in occasional night ambushes and making it impossible to track their ever-changing territory.

    <description>Giant antlions are the kinds of creatures that inspire nightmares. Like their smaller relatives, giant antlions hide in sand or other loose earth, and wait to ambush hapless passersby with their deadly jaws, which resemble a massive, chitinous bear trap.

Desert Trappers. Once it has found a suitable location, an antlion will then set its trap. Juvenile and adult antlions will even dig a steep, conical pit lined with loose sand, creating a hazard that prey can easily slip and tumble down, rolling directly into the beast's waiting jaws.

    <description>Spellcasters who are particularly attuned to the elemental planes or are inherently familiar with the desert's dunes may occasionally find and bind a desert cat familiar, especially those spellcasters who embody the desert cat's curiosity and propensity for chaos. A bound desert cat's behavior is erratic and varies greatly depending on its master's influence.

Desert cats also are exceptionally skilled at reaching otherwise difficult-to-reach locations to cause trouble, especially around precious gems and metals. A desert cat serving as a familiar has the following trait.

Familiar. At the GM's discretion, warlocks with the Pact of the Chain feature can choose a desert cat as their familiar, in addition to the forms listed in their class. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the desert cat senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. If its master causes it physical harm, the desert cat will end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.

    <description>Every traveler of the H'rethi Desert quickly learns to keep their eyes—and noses—peeled for sand lizards. Sand lizards are naturally camouflaged against the desert's golden sands, an evolutionary trait that allows them to easily catch prey with their deadly and venomous bite.

Preferring to lurk among the valleys of the dunes, these predators are faster than sand spiders, and a faint whiff of their carrion breath is all the warning you'll get before they strike.

    <description>Within the twisting, shifting rooms of the Desert Spire, the soul of the H'rethi itself abides. This manifestation of the landscape's sentience takes the form of a towering, crystalline structure within its lair. While the very few individuals that know of the H'rethi's physical form remain unendingly secretive about it, theories and legends still abound. Some ascribe the Desert Soul's birth to a fragment of some other deity's essence or a fragment of some legendary weapon of the gods. Regardless of the true origin, the fact is that H'rethi is present and powerful. Full of capricious whimsy and harsh judgment in equal measure, H'rethi is as likely to bless visitors as they are to demolish them.

    <description>According to legend, the very tapestry of fate warps when a three-headed ettin is born. Indeed, the birth of Dray was a time of calamitous upheaval and magical chaos. Since that time, the Butcher has gathered hundreds of followers among giant-kin and smallfolk alike, unified by their voracious hunger for war and ritualistic blood magic. Found most commonly in mountainous regions, the Three-Headed Ettin and his disciples collect and offer sacrifices for enhanced strength and powerful blood-wrought spells.

Poorly organized, followers of the Butcher are typically militant and quick to begin confrontation. The same magical boons that make them ferocious warriors also tend to amplify their emotional instabilities and push them toward the bloodiest solution. Despite all of this, the Three-Headed Ettin has numerous followers and is considered one of the most generous warlock patrons. Exceptionally gifted and skilled in his complex rituals and hemocraft, Dray fights with notorious ruthlessness.
Many of his abilities are empowered by the blood of his enemies, and recovery from the deadly wounds of his knife is incredibly difficult. Adventurers that make the mistake of heavily wounding the Butcher will be faced with additional ferocity as the ettin's hunger for violence is eclipsed by unfettered rage.

    <description>A true titan among creatures, the Superhydra is an ancient and terrifying entity. With powers of conjuration magic and a seemingly infinite and unfathomable number of heads, Grihoo manifests as a massive purple-headed hydra. Regardless of distance or relative size, the Superhydra manages to dwarf everything, leading scholars to believe that it exists partially outside our realm of reality. Followers of Grihoo tend to be vengeful, voracious, and violent, and occasionally seem driven to
madness by their insights into infinity. Compared to many other patrons, Grihoo can often seem aloof from his followers, only bonding with those it deems competent and then leaving them to fend for themselves. Because of, or perhaps in spite of this detachment, the few warlocks devoted to the Superhydra are fearsome foes. They tend to be quick learners in combat prowess and magical skill, especially in the art of conjuration magics like those employed by their patron. Their fatal folly tends to be an abundance of overconfidence in their abilities and a stubborn unwillingness to trust or rely on others around them. Those able to push past this weakness are to be observed with caution, and preferably from a great distance. 

On the exceptionally rare occasion that mortals deem themselves foolhardy enough to challenge the Superhydra in open combat, they quickly learn that the power and concept of infinity is not just familiar to Grihoo, but a practiced tool. It has a truly unfathomable number of heads, powerful conjuration magic to transport instantaneously and prevent the escape of his foes, and a ferocity that simply cannot be understood without a firsthand witness. Suffice to say, those lucky enough to witness Grihoo's might and survive are, no matter what they might say, exactly that and nothing more: lucky.

    <description>Scholars hypothesize that the Analeptic Lizard initially spawned in the wake of one of the many conjuration spells devoured by Grihoo. In most respects, it's indistinguishable from the average lizard or gecko. This reptilian creature has abnormally powerful regenerative abilities and keen intelligence for its size, making it surprisingly difficult to kill. Warlocks that successfully forge or force a bond with one of these strange lizards gain a tenacious and opinionated partner in crime.

    <description>Legends vary in their accounts of Lady Feluciana, and whether she is the oldest medusa or simply the most powerful of her kin. Like all medusas, the Lady is said to have been cursed due to her obsession with beauty and cruelty, but unlike other tales of such curses, nearly all accounts of Lady Feluciana state that she most certainly deserved hers. With many years to foment plans and practice her magic, the Lady is now a truly legendary sorceress and a terror to behold. Her followers are typically those that hunger for magical knowledge and power over other humanoids in their lives.

One of the most organized collections of warlocks, the Sorceress's followers focus mostly upon the study of potent and forbidden magics. In this, their patron seems to behave unpredictably, as the Lady's worshippers seem utterly unable to determine precisely what behaviors she constitutes as ideal. Some scholars speculate that she enjoys seeing occasional in-fighting and squabbling, perhaps viewing it as a necessary or helpful means of weeding out the unworthy and identifying the truly gifted. Regardless, those cunning and cutthroat enough to survive the metaphorical snake pit are worth keeping a very careful and close eye on.

Like many other Medusas, Lady Feluciana employs liberal use of terrain and her petrifying gaze to devastating effect. However, it should be noted that in stark contrast to typical Medusas, the Sorceress seems to have unlocked a more potent form of petrification magic, allowing her to petrify those she concentrates upon even if they avert their gaze. She is also exceptionally crafty, and reports indicate that her entire lair is covered in enchanted mirrors so she cannot be taken by surprise. However, it should be quite obvious that all information about the Lady is hearsay, given that not a single individual in recorded history has visited her lair and lived to tell the tale.

A frightened target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the Thousand Voices is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success.

On a 1 or 2, the target falls prone and then ends its turn. On a 3, the target takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 4, the target uses all of its movement to move within reach of a random creature, and then uses its action to make a melee weapon attack against that creature; if the target can't move within reach of another creature, it drops whatever it is holding and then end its turn.</text>

    <description>The Supreme Soul Vortex is directly responsible for the formation and disruptive actions of the Infinite Animarum, the widespread cult of disruptive and remorseless individuals that spread like an odorless toxin through the Material Plane. They actively manipulate Ochre Elson, the group's mysterious leader, to achieve their own ends. As one entity formed from countless lost spirits, the Thousand Voices seeks ultimate vengeance against the deities, both evil and good, and to upend the metaplanar system that caused its swirling souls to fall between the cracks of time and space. They actively recruit warlock followers in pursuit of this agenda, causing massive amounts of chaos and wanton destruction as they try to deprive the gods of their souls by making more Soul Vortices.

Those unlucky enough to face the Thousand Voices in open combat will have to face the combined knowledge and skill of hundreds of skilled spellcasters, masterful tacticians, and fearsome warriors. With potent spell- casting abilities and an ethereal form that allows them to escape most grasps, the Supreme Soul Vortex very rarely finds themself challenged enough to put forth their full strength. Most who challenge them are swiftly put down and, if they're lucky, are sent to one of the upper or lower planes. Especially while in the space between planes where Soul Vortices form, the Thousand Voices reign with confidence and might.

    <description>Although legends and lesser copies of the original abound, Vaanor is the one true and ancient Cerberus. He is a mighty and dedicated guardian of the millions of souls toiling across the lower planes, and preventing unauthorized travel. For centuries, the Cerberus has been the quintessential warden of souls, wholly dedicated to his task. Most individuals that follow or form pacts with Vaanor seek his skills in tracking, vigilance, and strength. Vaanor has a diametrical opposition to the Thousand Voices, as it and any other soul vortex's existence is a blatant flaunting of the comparatively few souls that have avoided his  jurisdiction.

Warlocks that forge a pact with the Primeval Cerberus tend to embrace their more animalistic traits, often behaving in the simplest and most efficient manner. They rely heavily on their enhanced senses to find their quarry, and seem to often take on an element of Vaanor's persistence. As such, they are thoroughly loyal companions so long as their trust is maintained, and are absolutely impossible to dissuade once a course of action is decided upon. The Primeval Cerberus appears to leave his followers on a long and loose leash, allowing or forcing them to follow their internal sense of direction and purpose.

Most individuals that find themselves facing Vaanor in combat meet their end quite abruptly. By all accounts, he refuses to play with his quarry, preferring instead to swiftly put them out of their misery or grab and return them to the lower planes as circumstances require. 

When necessary, the Cerberus can call upon hellhounds for a larger search pattern or to corner his prey. Those rare few daring or foolish enough to face Vaanor must face his mighty breath attack, made from the raging fires of hell and the souls of the damned. As far as the records show, the Cerberus has yet to fail in tracking and apprehending a fugitive soul.

    <description>No documentation exists entailing exactly where or when this miniature cerberi first appeared, and
scholars can only speculate why. In what seems an utterly stark contrast to full-sized cerberi, the cerberus pup most often appears in the form of an adorable but three-headed puppy of any number of potential breeds. Regardless of appearance however, a cerberus pup is always a skilled tracker with far more energy than normal for its size, as at least one head is always awake. 

Those fortunate enough to bond with a pup typically earn their lifelong loyalty, unless the pup is sorely mistreated.

    <description>Those few warriors that survive or even thrive within the Iron Maw Arena become full-fledged gladiators, favorite playthings of Magmarath's denizens. The long-term effects of their fiendish transfusion often results in an uncontrollable blood fury, making them exceptionally dangerous both in and outside the Arena's walls. These champions blend into the vicious crowds, just as comfortable in Magmarath as its fiendish denizens.

While doing so, the dyra gains increased size and vigor from its sturdy framework, and also gains additional offensive and defensive capabilities as the juggernaut helps ground and redirect electricity.

    <description>These lithe, fiendish felines actively stalk the shadowed alleyways of Magmarath in search of prey. In this way, they are very similar to predatory cats found on the Material Plane. Particularly renowned for their ferocity, flintclaws are protected by their dense black iron skeletons, and rend flesh like butter using their white hot metal claws. They are also frequently utilized in the Iron Maw Arena as motivation for races and other timed events, to such a degree that mortal challengers are often nicknamed 'flintclaw fodder'.

    <description>Where other portions of the Lower Planes utilize imps and quasits as spies or messengers, Magmarath utilizes the native kiir as elite couriers. They perform their duties with glee, relishing in each opportunity to flit across the planes. In this capacity, they adeptly don impenetrable illusory personas capable of fooling even the most pious of priests. Many such faith-driven folk have fallen prey to the deceit of a kiir's seemingly divine missive, leading to crusades and inquisitions of all kinds.

    <description>The elite fiendish sanguinor are crystalline humanoid creatures with poisonous scorpion-like tails and potent blood magic abilities. Fueled entirely by wrath and their craving for lood, they passively and actively drain the life force of those around them. When fighting, any spilt blood soaks into their mineral bodies, emphasizing the almost fiery refractive veins and arteries visible within.

    <description>Mizanoros is a prime sanguinor specimen, renowned for his unparalleled mastery of blood magic. Most notably, he was the fiend responsible for transfusing Malfuriel's celestial blood with transformative fiendish ichor and twisting normal imps into the Crimson Legion. As a Tribunal representative, Mizanoros mediates any disputes between the devilish and demonic members, and ensures that Magmarath's anger-fueled cohesion holds.

    <description>Lawbreakers are uncommon in etherean society, but their stringent laws place very little importance on the possessions of the denizens of other planes. Some ethereans make their living by 'liberating' valuable resources from their neighbors on the Material Plane, usually focusing on commodities not found on the Ethereal. For some, this means retrieving basic food, or raw materials for crafting; for others, it means fine jewelry or exquisite art.

    <description>These small, silvery fish have developed the ability to shift between the Ethereal and Material Planes as a potent defense against their numerous predators. Ether fish can be found most reliably near bodies of fresh water, although their ability to fly notably adds clouds to the list of possibilities. Students of the Ethereal Plane speculate that the creatures—which have never been observed eating insects, algae, or similar visible food sources—might derive nutrients through environmental absorption.

    <description>The Border Ethereal has comparatively little fauna, but there are a select few notable apex predators to be found. Hammerhead ether-eels are one such predator, uniquely adapted to the shifting fog of the Ethereal realm. Their massive size belies their sky-slithering speed, resulting in horrifying tales from the few souls lucky enough to survive such an encounter. Indeed, even hinting at the trademark X-shaped head of this creature among ethereans is seen as taboo, foretelling doom for a settlement.

    <description>Of all the terrifying spirits and terrors that lurk within the Border Ethereal's gauzy embrace, none is more horrific than the slumber phantom. With its completely unknown origins, most people on the Material and Ethereal Planes know only legends of the phantom, calling it a sandman, boogeyman, or other such monikers. Regardless of name, one aspect of the stories is certain: if it decides to haunt your dreams or hunt you physically, you're best off praying to your deity of choice for a swift end.

Undead Nature. A slumber phantom doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Believed by many to be mere legend, the aqualisk is in fact the apex predator of Lake Ils. It has attained this mysterious status largely due to its ability to travel between the Material and Ethereal Planes at will. Though sightings are rare, it fiercely protects its territory from pirates, dragon turtles, and other threats. The Spire wizards are the only ones who are aware of its factual existence, and they offer it Beer-Battered Fish Sticks in exchange for its protection of Orostead. If something invades its underwater territory, it's quick to retaliate with full force.

Although they are uncertain, rumors have spread that Hawkren is attempting to return the spirit of Dendallen to power by collecting the late necromancer's items, which are said to remain with his previous servants.

    <description>Ogden was once a student at the Spire, and studied directly under Aristaeus before age claimed him. Unfortunately, his appetite for learning was not satisfied due to the constraints placed by the school on necromancy, and he fled the Spire to plumb the depths of the world for darker, secret knowledge.

Eventually successful, Fellweaver has now risen to power on a throne of viciousness and cruelty. His
reign of terror and usage of heinous and long-forgotten necromancy has spread across the land, and many in Orostead fear that he may seek to claim the Spire and revenge one day.

    <description>Powerful mages in their own right, the teachers at the Spire are very different in personality but united in their dedication to education. The teachers make frequent use of their Borbos's joyous wands of color to demonstrate equations and formulae without wasting precious ink and paper.

    <description>Students of the Spire are easily identifiable, perhaps on purpose, by their spellwoven robes and doodle rings. Although each individual has their own destiny and goals, theyall share a voracious love of learning and magic, which has led them here. Education at the Spire  places great importance on practical aspects of magic, and the importance of learning to create, rather than just destroy, with their powers.

    <description>Revered among the Rocborne for their regal bearing, close connection to nature, and hypnotic flight, giant horned snakes have a complicated relationship with other creatures in the skies given their considerable intelligence. Crafty combatants, many Rocborne Homes choose to negotiate with these creatures rather than face them with hostility.

    <description>Believed to be the product of numerous corrupt and villainous souls, a storm spirit is the worst possible denizen of the sky a Rocborne Home can encounter. Capable of laying waste to the unprepared, storm spirits are cruel, destructive forces of nature. Many of the Rocborne's stories warn that incurring nature's wrath will lead a storm spirit towards the offender's home to lay waste to all they hold dear.

    <description>The main breadth and body of the Justicars are made up of justices. Having been thoroughly indoctrinated and proving loyal on all occasions, most fighting between mages and Justicars is carried out by its justices. For many, their first introduction to the faction is via its justices. Whether they are actively hunting a mage, or directing their fellow Justicars, a justice stands out from the crowd simply by their presence and comportment.

    <description>Perhaps the only thing truly feared by rank and file Justicars, magebreakers are uniquely trained to combat the skills and abilities of mages, Justicars, and Spelldrinkers alike. Operating outside the main command structure and only reporting to mage-arbiters, mere rumor of a magebreaker visiting an outpost of Justicars inspires fear and strict observance of the Justicar rules and regulations.

    <trait>
      <name>Limited Magic Immunity</name>
      <text>The swarm can't be affected or detected by spells of 2nd level or lower unless it wishes to be. It has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects. In addition, if the swarm is subjected to a spell or other magical effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Scornful Reinforcement</name>
      <text>When the swarm kills a creature that has a familiar, the familiar joins the swarm, causing the swarm's hit point maximum and current hit points to increase by 10.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Spell Detection</name>
      <text>The swarm immediately knows when a spell of 3rd-level or higher has been cast within 1000 feet of it, and it can sense the direction to the spellcaster's location.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Swarm</name>
      <text>The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny familiar.</text>
    </trait>
    <action>
      <name>Multiattack</name>
      <text>The swarm makes two attacks.</text>
    </action>
    <action>
      <name>Spiteful Touch</name>
      <text>Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 14 (4d6) force damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, or 7 (2d6) force damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer.</text>
    </action>
    <action>
      <name>Drain Magic</name>
      <text>The swarm attempts to siphone some magical power from a creature it can see within 10 feet of it. If the target has any remaining spell slots, it must make a DC 16 Saving throw using its spellcasting ability. The target makes this saving throw with disadvantage if it has less than half its spell slots remaining.
On a failed save, the target loses one spell slot. If the target has no remaining spell slots of that level, it instead loses its highest remaining spell slot below that level. The swarm then regains 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot lost.</text>
    </action>
    <reaction>
      <name>Arcane Barrier</name>
      <text>The swarm adds 3 to its AC against one attack that would hit it, as it creates an instantaneous shield of force around itself.</text>

    <description>No one is quite certain why some familiars linger after the death of their bonded mages, but legend says it's because they were horribly mistreated. Regardless of previous reason, scorned familiars gather together and hunt mages, drawing strength from their ineffectual magic and increasing their numbers when they kill a mage and free a familiar from their bond.
