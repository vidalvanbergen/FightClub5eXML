      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Geletons are the living, symbiotic fusion of two semiconscious life forms: oozes and reanimated skeletons. When a skeleton suspended in an ooze is subjected to necromancy that would normally transform it into a mindless thrall, it's possible for the ooze to magically connect to the reanimated body, and its departed life, instead. This event is called Synthesis, and it's through this process that the fragments of life held by ooze and skeleton can come together to form a complete whole. Occasionally called Symblexes for their parallels to other intelligent oozes, geletons are given a rare second chance at life-one that they are as moldable to as their gelatinous forms themselves.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>A Brand New Life</name>
      <text>At the start of their new lives, geletons are featureless, ooze-covered humanoids with only a spark of traditional consciousness. Over time, usually about a month, this small consciousness grows into a fully sentient being just like any other. During this period, a geleton's appearance also becomes more discernable, and eventually grows into a humanoid form that feels natural to its budding sense of self. The memories from any of their previous lives are lost in this process, but can resurface in pieces through hazy dreams or waves of déjà vu.
	Without a unified culture or history, each geleton's story is unique. Many geletons adopt attitudes similar to those close to them early on in their lives, but others develop strong personalities entirely on their own.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Dangerous Beginnings</name>
      <text>By their very nature, almost all geletons come to life in dangerous places. For however many there are in the world, there are countless more that inevitably perished shortly after their creation. Some unscrupulous figures—typically necromancers or mad scientists—try to use the process of Synthesis for personal gain, but are for the most part stopped whenever they're discovered. Geletons created and held captive in such harrowing conditions for a long time often carry a deep-seated fear or resentment for necromancy, if not all magic, for the remainder of their lives. Other geletons created in such conditions recover faster, especially if they are found and rescued shortly after their Synthesis. Regardless, the origins of virtually all geletons are rife with danger, and those that are brought into safety early in their lives are counted among the most lucky.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Unusual Appearance</name>
      <text>By far, gelatinous cubes are the most common subject of Synthesis. These clear oozes are known to carry skeletal remains longer than others, and in doing so have a higher chance of becoming a geleton. As a result, most geletons' bodies are similarly translucent. When other oozes like black puddings or ochre jellies undergo Synthesis, the resulting geleton's appearance is typically more opaque.
	Regardless of the ooze, a geleton's form always reflects their desired features. Most eventually resemble humans or elves, but when a dragonborn or tiefling skeleton is used in Synthesis, their appearance will often reflect that ancestry in some capacity. Similarly, all geletons have a viscous sheen to their bodies, and though they may have the appearance of hair or eyes, they are still fully gelatinous in nature.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Geleton Names</name>
      <text>Geletons tend to choose names that are important to them and are independent of the gender that they eventually choose to assume, if any. These names may be based on items that were nearby when they gained sentience, or could even be based on names they dimly remember. Geletons that are rescued or become part of an adventuring party early in their lives may choose to adopt or modify a name given to them by an ally, rather than create one from scratch.</text>

      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Geletons come to life fully matured but may resemble a younger or older creature. Their full life span is unknown, but in general they live for about a century.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Geletons are as likely to be good as they are to be evil. Their personality is molded by the company they keep and the environment around them, especially during the formative months following their Synthesis. Many geletons end up at least partly neutral.</text>
    </trait>

      <name>Darkvision</name>
      <text>Your eyes were magically formed from ooze through the process of your creation, granting you a degree of vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</text>
    </trait>

      <name>Wakeful</name>
      <text>Geletons only need to sleep for a short time each day. Even while sleeping, you remain aware of your immediate surroundings thanks to your limited blindsight. After sleeping for 4 hours, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Ethereans are, as their name would suggest, the unlikely settlers of the Border Ethereal. They grow up experiencing the Material Plane from a distance, viewing it through the gray and muffling barrier between the planes of existence. Most ethereans live in small communities spread throughout the Border Ethereal and find joy in poetry, art, and theater that offsets the drab and relative lifelessness of their home. While only a few monsters are able to threaten those on the Border Ethereal, etherean survival is only maintainable through their tenacity and shared sense of decency. For many ethereans, the relative safety of the Ethereal Plane outweighs the richer experiences of the Material, but for those that do manage to cross that planar threshold, there is simply no comparison.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>An Obscure Lineage</name>
      <text>Ethereans resemble elves with light gray skin, but their hair and eyes are distinctly different. Many ethereans' eyes and hair are either purple or magenta, but it's not unheard of for them to come in a full spectrum of colors—a curious result of living extensively on the Ethereal Plane. Further, an etherean's hair drifts and floats on its own, as if carried by an invisible current, before evaporating into nothing at its ends.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Decent By Necessity</name>
      <text>The Border Ethereal allows for a free range of movement in any direction, including through solid objects located on the Material Plane. As a result, privacy is extremely coveted by those on the Ethereal Plane, who are constantly aware of the near-impossibility of complete safety from others. Over generations, etherean culture has grown to uphold and teach a powerful focus on common decency between them. This often translates to relatively lawful communities among ethereans, who expect that their safety and privacy will be respected in exchange for their own adherence.
	However, whether it be the result of a possible fey ancestry or defiance of their strict social structure, most ethereans have a deep appreciation of harmless pranks and practical jokes. In general, as long as it's in good fun, moments of levity like these are part of the fabric that keeps ethereans happy and entertained in an otherwise quiet and dull world.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Worlds to Experience</name>
      <text>Ethereans typically take up adventuring when the routine of the Border Ethereal no longer interests them. Such ethereans often go searching for a means of travel into the Material Plane, but only some manage to find them. Those that do are thrust into a world suddenly bound by gravity and rife with danger, but also filled with opportunity and new experiences. Many ethereans will happily accept contracts to travel great distances or visit exotic realms, regardless of danger, in order to make the most of their life beyond the Border Ethereal.
	Ethereans will often choose to spend their coin on brightly colored and ostentatious clothing, seemingly making up for the limited color palettes they may have experienced on the Border Ethereal. Others fall victim to new vices, but more often than not, strict etherean resourcefulness is enough to prevent all but the most vulnerable ethereans from becoming addicted to the pleasures of the Material Plane.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Etherean Names</name>
      <text>An etherean has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Etherean nicknames often sound purposefully silly, and are just as likely to be self-given as they are by friends or family.

Given Names: Antham, Cheyl, Corifir, Crena, Destva, Euranya, Genoven, Hanshen, Hosh, Irsht, Jeun, Kline, Krimme, Luddin, Osvo, Ozla, Pragil, Prinn, Quord, Tresht, Tryll, Ulram, Ura, Vass, Vertra

    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Because of the strict code of conduct that's necessary when living in etherean society, most ethereans are lawful out of a sense of honor or decency. However, many ethereans enjoy setting silly pranks, provided that they aren't mean-spirited, in order to fulfill some of their more chaotic leanings. They have no particular inclination toward evil or good, although many that survive in the more untamed corners of the Ethereal Plane will end up evil out of necessity.</text>

      <name>Darkvision</name>
      <text>Accustomed to the chaotic and often unavoidable lighting of the Border Ethereal, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Misty Sight</name>
      <text>Your eyes are naturally attuned to the Border Ethereal, allowing you to always see out to your normal range while on the Ethereal Plane.
	You can also use a bonus action to focus on seeing the unseen. For 1 minute, or until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell), you can see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Veil Shift</name>
      <text>You can use an action while on the Material Plane to slip into the Ethereal Plane, and vice versa, until the start of your next turn. Any object you take while on this other plane of existence is left there when you return to your original one. While on the Ethereal Plane in this way, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane, and you still move as if you were on the Material Plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you or interact with you while you're there, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so, although you can still see and hear them. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Languages</name>
      <text>You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. Ethereans tend to learn the languages of neighboring creatures from the Material Plane.</text>
