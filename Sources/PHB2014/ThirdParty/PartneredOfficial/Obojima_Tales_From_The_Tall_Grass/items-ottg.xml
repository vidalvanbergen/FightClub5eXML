    <text>This tarnished and dented teapot appears like an unimportant mundane item. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the pot when shaken, and it always feels warm to the touch. When the lid is removed, three tendrils of colored smoke rise from its blackened center. At the top of the tendrils are the smushed faces of 3 elderly men, all of which quickly begin to bicker amongst themselves. You can ask each man one question, and he will answer to the best of his ability. Once you have asked them all a question, they begin to ignore you and continue to argue amongst themselves until the lid is replaced at the top of the pot.
	It's unknown who these men were, but each seems to retain knowledge from their past lives. Once you ask one of the men a question, you can't ask him another question until 7 days have passed.

    <text>You can choose to activate this boomerang's swirling vortex whenever you attack with it. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

Special: When thrown, the boomerang returns to an unoccupied space adjacent to you. As a reaction, you can choose to catch it.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Once you regain hit points in this way, you can't benefit from a short rest until the next dawn.
	Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn, after which point you must spend 1 hour performing a revitalizing ritual on the pendant for it to regain the use of this property. The ritual consumes three common potion ingredients.

Roll a d4; on a roll of 3 or lower, you regain an expended spell slot of a level equal to the number rolled (if you don't have any expended spell slots of that level, you instead regain a spell slot of the next-highest level that you have expended). On a roll of 4, you teleport 30 feet in a random direction. Once you regain a spell slot in this way you can't do so again until the next dawn.

    <text>Unlike other frying pans, this enchanted wok both imbues its food with healing properties and heats up to strike a burning blow against its enemies. The wok is considered a +1 frying pan, which deals an extra 1d4 fire damage on a hit.
	Not only can the wok cook food without the need for a fire, creatures that eat food prepared in the wok within an hour of it being cooked gain 1d6 temporary hit points. Temporary hit points gained by the wok's food last for 1 hour. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Special: When wielding a frying pan, you can use your bonus action to add a +1 bonus to your AC until the end of your next turn. You can't gain this benefit while wielding a shield.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>Although frowned upon in many villages, this useful potion is still sought after by many islanders for both wholesome and nefarious reasons. You can pour the potion into a lock, loosening the mechanism inside and decreasing the DC to pick it by 1d4. Once a lock's DC is reduced by this potion, its DC can't be reduced by another liquid lockpick potion. The effects of this potion last for 1 hour.

The clone appears to be the same as you in every way, but it has half of your hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment other than mundane clothes. Otherwise, the clone uses all of your statistics, except that it is a construct. The clone lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.
	While the clone exists, your original body stays in a constant deep sleep, where it requires no nourishment, but it can still suffer damage as normal. The clone lasts until you dismiss it or it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it disappears in a cloud of butterflies. When it disappears, your mind returns to your original body.
