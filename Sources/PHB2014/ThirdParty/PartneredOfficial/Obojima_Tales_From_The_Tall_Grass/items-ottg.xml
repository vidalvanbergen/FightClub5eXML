    <text>Special: When thrown, the boomerang returns to an unoccupied space adjacent to you. As a reaction, you can choose to catch it.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Proficiency: simple, boomerang

    <text>Special: Although it can be used as a weapon, the butterfly staff is more commonly used as a tool to catch small spirits and critters. Its tall haft is capped with a well-woven net, which is often made from sheep dragon wool.
	When you make a grapple check while holding the butterfly staff, you can use the staff to target a Small or smaller creature that is up to 10 feet away from you. When you do so, you use your attack modifier for the weapon in place of your Strength (Athletics) check. While grappling a creature in this way, you can't make another attack with the butterfly staff.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
