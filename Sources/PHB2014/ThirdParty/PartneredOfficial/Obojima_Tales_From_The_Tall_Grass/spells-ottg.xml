    <text>A jolt of electricity springs from your hand towards a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage.
	Alternatively, you can target a machine within range and temporarily turn it on, allowing it to function as if it were whelmed by a spirit or permanently enchanted. Machines targeted by this spell stay powered for 18 seconds before turning back off. For a machine to function using this spell, it must still be in working condition.

Cantrip Upgrade: The spells damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
