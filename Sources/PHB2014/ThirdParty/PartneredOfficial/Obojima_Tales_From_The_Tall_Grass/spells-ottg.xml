    <text>This spell transforms a beast that you can see within range into a new humanoid form. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a beast with 0 hit points.
	The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form has the appearance of a humanoid of any race you choose. The target's game statistics, excluding mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of a commoner. It retains its alignment and personality.
	The target assumes the hit points of its commoner form. When it reverts to its normal form, the beast returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the beast's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
	The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell's duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 2nd.

    <text>You blow a bubble around any solid, granular, or liquid object that weighs 500 pounds or less, causing it to float 4 feet off the ground. No matter what the contents of the bubble are, the bubble weighs 10 pounds and can be pushed using an action. Strong winds or effects that would push a creature also push the bubble. The bubble always floats at least 4 feet off the ground, and descends from a fall at a speed of 10 feet per round.
	As an action, a creature can pierce the outside of the bubble, causing it to pop and releasing its contents.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can increase the weight the bubble can lift by 500 pounds for each slot level above 1st.

When a creature attempts to leave the spell's area, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is pulled back to an unoccupied space closest to the center of the sphere.

    <text>Choose a beast that you can see within range. The beast is affected if it has a challenge rating of 2 or lower; otherwise, the spell fails. An affected creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you take total and precise control of it, as your consciousness enters its body. While under the effect of this spell, you can see through the creature's eyes and hear what it hears, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the creature has. You can move and take actions as the creature and can perform tasks the creature could feasibly perform. During this time, your body is considered unconscious; this doesn't affect your ability to concentrate on this spell.
	If the creature takes damage, you must make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, with a DC equal to 10 or half the damage it took, whichever number is higher. On a failure, the creature regains control of its body, and the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the maximum challenge rating affected by this spell increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.

    <text>As you cast the spell, you inscribe onto your blank ticket the code of a permanent train stop of your choice whose stop number you're already familiar with. A shimmering sign and small bench appears behind you as the Wandering Line arrives on tracks which materialize before it. Your ticket allows passage for you and up to eight creatures of your choice. It takes 1 hour to arrive at your destination, no matter the distance.
	During your travel other stops may occur and are determined by the GM. If you or any friendly creature chooses to take a short rest while traveling and regains hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, you also regain an extra 1d10 hit points.
	There are countless train stops, each of which includes a unique train stop number. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the code for two destinations, determined by the GM. You can learn additional codes during your adventures. You can commit a new code sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

For the duration, your Armor Class becomes 20 (if it wasn't already higher), you gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you gain blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. In addition, you can use your bonus action to make a melee weapon attack using your claws. This attack uses your spell attack bonus and deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit.
	Additionally, your ethereal shell has a damage threshold of 15 hit points. A damage threshold gives you immunity to all damage unless it is an amount of damage equal to or greater than the threshold value, in which case you take damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the shell's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce any hit points.

The blocks are invisible to all creatures except you and any creature you designate when you cast the spell. A creature that can see the dara blocks (including one benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous cube made of a transparent, dark green light.
	A block fixed in the air can hold up to 5,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the block to fall. A creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, moving the fixed block up to 10 feet on a success.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create two additional dara blocks for each slot level above 3rd.

For the duration, the target becomes the Festival King and has an aura of importance that emanates from them. Any creature that moves to a space within 20 feet of the Festival King for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, must make a Charisma saving throw. A creature that can't be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically. On a failed save, the creature becomes enamored with the Festival King, chanting, and dancing around them. While under the effects of the spell, creatures spend their action and bonus action at the start of their turn giving all of their attention and admiration to the Festival King.
	If a creature starts its turn outside of the Festival King's aura, it is no longer under the effects of the spell.

Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the shrub for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, is targeted by the shrub's leaf attack. The shrub makes a ranged weapon attack, using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, a creature takes ld4 slashing damage.

On your turn, you can use a bonus action to make a shrub use its leaf attack against one creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple shrubs created by you are within 10 feet of the target, this attack deals 1d4 slashing damage per shrub on a hit.

While the swarm is traveling, it obstructs a 5-foot-cube area as if it were a Medium creature.
	While the swarm is traveling, it can be attacked. It has an AC equal to your spell save DC. For every attack that hits the swarm, the number of birds in the swarm is reduced by one.
	At the start of your turn on the round that the swarm reaches its target, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage for each bird remaining in the swarm. The birds then disappear.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the number of birds in the swarm increases by two for each slot level above 5th; if the target is within 30 feet of you when you cast the spell, it takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>This spell allows you to change the appearance of two humanoids that you can see within range. Each target takes on an illusory disguise, making it look like the other target—including its armor, clothing, weapons, and other belongings on its person. Each creature can seem 1 foot shorter or taller; the disguise otherwise replicates the other target's physical features as accurately as possible. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
	The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if this spell causes a creature to gain a cape from its disguise, objects pass through the cape, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's back or shoulders. If this spell causes a creature to appear thinner than it is, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch the creature would bump into it while it was seemingly still in midair.
	A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

    <text>A lush bunch of vegetable fronds suddenly springs from the ground in an unoccupied space you can see within range. As a bonus action, a creature can pull the fronds from the ground, revealing a root vegetable of your choice that has been grown in the shape of a blade. For the duration, a creature can use the vegetable blade as a melee weapon with which it is proficient. The blade deals 1d12 slashing damage on a hit (adding your ability modifier to the damage roll as normal), and it has the finesse property.
	Additionally, on subsequent turns, the wielder or one of its allies can use a bonus action to take a bite out of the blade. Doing so heals the creature for a number of hit points equal to the blade's damage die + your spellcasting ability modifier. Once a creature has taken a bite out of the blade, its damage die is reduced by one size-from a d12 to a d10, for example. If the blade is reduced beyond a d4, it is destroyed and the spell ends early.
