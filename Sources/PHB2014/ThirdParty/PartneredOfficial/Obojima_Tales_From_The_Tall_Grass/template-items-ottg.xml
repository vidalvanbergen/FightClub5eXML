    <text>This magical bow can split arrows as you fire it, allowing you to target two creatures within 10 feet of each other. When you use the bow in this way, you make only one attack roll, which applies to both targets. If the attack hits at least one of the targets, roll damage normally; each target takes half the amount of damage rolled (rounded down).</text>

    <text>A creature in possession of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet can perform a 1-hour ritual (as if attuning to a magic item) to combine those items, forming the Weapon of the Sun and Moon.
	In addition to having the properties of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet, this weapon is considered a +1 Weapon and gains two Eclipse Powers. During the day, the Weapon of the Sun and Moon can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Darkness spell; this version of the spell creates a 60-foot-radius sphere of darkness, instead of its normal size. During the night, it can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Daylight spell. Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.</text>
