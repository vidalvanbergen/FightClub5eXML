        <text>You have become afflicted by the mysterious illness that haunts the island known as the Corruption. This same foul magic, which has stained the coastlines black, now resides within your body. It curses your skin and seeps from your pores, and in time it will even become difficult to distinguish you from it.
	How this has happened is your story to tell. You may have been one of the first responders to the Corruption when it came to the shores of Obojima leaving you to possibly be the only survivor of that brave band of rangers. Perhaps you were an explorer, who stumbled on a pocket of Corruption and became infected, or maybe you were inflicted with this Corruption by an evil witch.

        <name>1st Manifestation (Corrupted Ranger (Third Party))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, the Corruption within begins to manifest in combat.
	Whenever you take damage, you also receive a curse marker; if the damage was from a critical hit, you receive two curse markers instead. These markers will remain active until the end of your next turn, and the maximum number of curse markers you can accumulate at a time is 2. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, all the curse markers you have gained are instantly consumed, dealing an extra 1d4 necrotic damage to the target for each curse marker consumed.
	Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to call upon your Corruption to immediately gain the maximum number of curse markers available to you. When you use this ability, you can't gain more than your maximum number of curse markers.
	The number of curse markers you can accumulate at once increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 3 at 5th level, 4 at 11th level, and 5 at 17th level.

        <text>At 3rd level, you start to observe peculiar happenings within your own body. At times you notice that your limbs and torso exhibit independent movements, seemingly acting of their own volition.
	When you make a Strength or Dexterity check, you can choose to replace the result with a number equal to 10 + your ranger level. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use this feature, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

        <name>3rd Manifestation (Corrupted Ranger (Third Party))</name>
        <text>Starting at 7th level, when you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one curse marker to roll a d4 and add it to the attack roll. You can choose to use a curse marker in this way before or after making the attack roll. You can expend a curse marker in this way only once per turn.
	Additionally, whenever you take damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to your ranger level. Once you reduce damage in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>At 11th level, your ailment is beginning to have side effects on your body. Gain one of the following ailments of your choice.

Graying Vision. Your eyes weaken and the world around you begins to lose some of its colorful luster. To adjust to your slowly worsening vision, you've gained blindsight out to a range of 15 feet. In addition, you automatically detect visual illusions if their Intelligence (Investigation) check DC is less than or equal to your ranger spell save DC.

Failing Lungs. Your lungs have begun to ache and your days are filled with excessive coughing. At times you feel yourself gasping for air, and it's in those moments you've learned to steal another's breath. As an action, you pull your next breath from a creature you can see. The target falls prone and can't take reactions until the start of your next turn. Additionally, all of your curse markers are consumed, dealing 1d4 necrotic damage to the creature for each marker consumed in this way.
	Alternatively, you can give your breath to another creature. Whenever a creature you can see makes a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to give it advantage on the saving throw and increase its speed by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.

Losing Feeling. Numbness creeps into your muscles and bones and across your skin. The vibrancy of feeling gives way to a broad antagonism. Your hands and arms instead burn with a cold ethereal flame, which only you can see. As a bonus action, you can target a creature you can see within 60 feet of you, enveloping it with the same cursed flames. When you deal damage with your curse markers to a creature that has been enveloped by your flames, each curse marker deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, instead of 1d4.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
