    <text>This weapon is crafted with strands of moonlight. At night, attacks with it deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.

Special: When thrown, the boomerang returns to an unoccupied space adjacent to you. As a reaction, you can choose to catch it.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Special: Although it can be used as a weapon, the butterfly staff is more commonly used as a tool to catch small spirits and critters. Its tall haft is capped with a well-woven net, which is often made from sheep dragon wool.
	When you make a grapple check while holding the butterfly staff, you can use the staff to target a Small or smaller creature that is up to 10 feet away from you. When you do so, you use your attack modifier for the weapon in place of your Strength (Athletics) check. While grappling a creature in this way, you can't make another attack with the butterfly staff.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

The traditional Obojiman instrument has gotten a second life as a swift club-like weapon commonly used by traveling performers. It is crafted from a special coral found all across the shallows, which naturally forms with dozens of tiny holes that run throughout the body of the instrumental weapon. When swung it emits a beautiful harmonic sound.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Special: These heavy honey dipper shaped clubs are traditionally used for mixing the giant vats of wax used by the Courier Brigade to seal packages and craft candles. They're now used by postal knights and adventurers as a useful defensive and offensive tool.
	While wielding a candlemaker's club, you can use a bonus action to extinguish a flame within 5 feet of you.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

This strange and intimidating weapon was made for fishing in the reefs and crags of the Shallows. Its long haft is tipped with a spherical array of thin sharp barbs, which gave the spear its title, as its silhouette is reminiscent of a blooming dandelion.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

The short and angular blade of a lom lom dagger was designed for cleaving and quickly became a staple in most of Obojima's kitchens. Over time, the blade length grew longer and longer, and eventually the lom lom dagger made its way out of the kitchen and into the hands of adventurers, who favored it for its balance and accuracy when thrown.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Although it's not much of a secret nowadays, the magical stone known as feather rock, which is used to craft these stone swords, was once coveted and kept hidden by the Nakudama. Even though feather rock is now commonly used by potion brewers, and the craft of making one of these swords is fairly common, the name has stayed the same.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

A tapper sack is a simple tool and weapon used by farmers. At the end of a fine, yet sturdy, braided cord is a simple bag which has been filled with sand. Although it's not very flashy, in the hands of a skilled adventurer this humble weapon packs quite a punch.

Special: The jagged vertebrae sword of a fishfolk warrior can barely be called a sword. Locals would say it's better described as a makeshift weapon crafted from a fish skeleton and sea trash. Its poor construction is the reason it's not often a weapon seen on land, though when used by a skilled fighter, it most certainly can be a formidable tool.
	When you successfully hit a creature with a vertebrae sword, you can use a bonus action to rake and twist the weapon, breaking off some of the sword's boney barbs and dealing an extra 1d8 piercing damage. The vertebrae sword can only be used in this way 5 times before it becomes unusable as a weapon.

Special: The vaulter's axe was designed by the Rangers of the Greenward Path for exploring the Brackwater Wetlands. Its tall haft allows wielders of the axe to easily check water depths and vault over obstacles. To this day it's a useful tool for anyone exploring the eastern side of the island.
	As part of your movement, you can use the vaulter's axe to launch yourself 15 feet over a creature or obstacle. Using your movement in this way ignores nonmagical difficult terrain.

Also known as the merchant's blade, the field spear was proven a useful and sturdy tool by the hundreds of merchants and travelers that use it in their expeditions across the island. Its shorter haft is roughly half the size of a standard spear and its tip is more similar to a wide blade or dagger than the traditional spear tip.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

The Nakudama bubble rod is most recognizable by the curious sounds it produces when used. The wet descending whistle of multiple water filled glass marbles shot from the end of the oblong tube, quickly followed by the unmistakable pop of the ammunition as they hit their target.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

This weapon is crafted with strands of moonlight. At night, attacks with it deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.

This crossbow is fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the cartridge runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

A hoopak is a sturdy stick with a sling at one end and a pointed tip at the other.

Special: When you make a melee attack with this weapon, you ignore its ammunition property. You can use the hoopak as a martial ranged weapon. If you do, it uses the ammunition property, uses sling bullets, and deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>This weapon is crafted with strands of moonlight. At night, attacks with it deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.

The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

This weapon is crafted with strands of moonlight. At night, attacks with it deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Special: A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt

This magical bow can split arrows as you fire it, allowing you to target two creatures within 10 feet of each other. When you use the bow in this way, you make only one attack roll, which applies to both targets. If the attack hits at least one of the targets, roll damage normally; each target takes half the amount of damage rolled (rounded down).

This crossbow is fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the cartridge runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Special: When thrown, the boomerang returns to an unoccupied space adjacent to you. As a reaction, you can choose to catch it.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Special: Although it can be used as a weapon, the butterfly staff is more commonly used as a tool to catch small spirits and critters. Its tall haft is capped with a well-woven net, which is often made from sheep dragon wool.
	When you make a grapple check while holding the butterfly staff, you can use the staff to target a Small or smaller creature that is up to 10 feet away from you. When you do so, you use your attack modifier for the weapon in place of your Strength (Athletics) check. While grappling a creature in this way, you can't make another attack with the butterfly staff.

    <text>A creature in possession of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet can perform a 1-hour ritual (as if attuning to a magic item) to combine those items, forming the Weapon of the Sun and Moon.
	In addition to having the properties of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet, this weapon is considered a +1 Weapon and gains two Eclipse Powers. During the day, the Weapon of the Sun and Moon can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Darkness spell; this version of the spell creates a 60-foot-radius sphere of darkness, instead of its normal size. During the night, it can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Daylight spell. Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

Special: Whenever you take falling damage while wielding an umbrella, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by a number equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Proficiency: simple, umbrella

The traditional Obojiman instrument has gotten a second life as a swift club-like weapon commonly used by traveling performers. It is crafted from a special coral found all across the shallows, which naturally forms with dozens of tiny holes that run throughout the body of the instrumental weapon. When swung it emits a beautiful harmonic sound.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Special: These heavy honey dipper shaped clubs are traditionally used for mixing the giant vats of wax used by the Courier Brigade to seal packages and craft candles. They're now used by postal knights and adventurers as a useful defensive and offensive tool.
	While wielding a candlemaker's club, you can use a bonus action to extinguish a flame within 5 feet of you.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

This strange and intimidating weapon was made for fishing in the reefs and crags of the Shallows. Its long haft is tipped with a spherical array of thin sharp barbs, which gave the spear its title, as its silhouette is reminiscent of a blooming dandelion.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

The short and angular blade of a lom lom dagger was designed for cleaving and quickly became a staple in most of Obojima's kitchens. Over time, the blade length grew longer and longer, and eventually the lom lom dagger made its way out of the kitchen and into the hands of adventurers, who favored it for its balance and accuracy when thrown.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Although it's not much of a secret nowadays, the magical stone known as feather rock, which is used to craft these stone swords, was once coveted and kept hidden by the Nakudama. Even though feather rock is now commonly used by potion brewers, and the craft of making one of these swords is fairly common, the name has stayed the same.

Special: As a bonus action, you can make a contested Strength check against a creature within range, moving the target to another unoccupied space within 5 feet of you on a success.

A tapper sack is a simple tool and weapon used by farmers. At the end of a fine, yet sturdy, braided cord is a simple bag which has been filled with sand. Although it's not very flashy, in the hands of a skilled adventurer this humble weapon packs quite a punch.

Special: The jagged vertebrae sword of a fishfolk warrior can barely be called a sword. Locals would say it's better described as a makeshift weapon crafted from a fish skeleton and sea trash. Its poor construction is the reason it's not often a weapon seen on land, though when used by a skilled fighter, it most certainly can be a formidable tool.
	When you successfully hit a creature with a vertebrae sword, you can use a bonus action to rake and twist the weapon, breaking off some of the sword's boney barbs and dealing an extra 1d8 piercing damage. The vertebrae sword can only be used in this way 5 times before it becomes unusable as a weapon.

Special: The vaulter's axe was designed by the Rangers of the Greenward Path for exploring the Brackwater Wetlands. Its tall haft allows wielders of the axe to easily check water depths and vault over obstacles. To this day it's a useful tool for anyone exploring the eastern side of the island.
	As part of your movement, you can use the vaulter's axe to launch yourself 15 feet over a creature or obstacle. Using your movement in this way ignores nonmagical difficult terrain.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Also known as the merchant's blade, the field spear was proven a useful and sturdy tool by the hundreds of merchants and travelers that use it in their expeditions across the island. Its shorter haft is roughly half the size of a standard spear and its tip is more similar to a wide blade or dagger than the traditional spear tip.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

	In addition to having the properties of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet, this weapon is considered a +1 Weapon and gains two Eclipse Powers. During the day, the Weapon of the Sun and Moon can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Darkness spell; this version of the spell creates a 60-foot-radius sphere of darkness, instead of its normal size. During the night, it can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Daylight spell. Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

The Nakudama bubble rod is most recognizable by the curious sounds it produces when used. The wet descending whistle of multiple water filled glass marbles shot from the end of the oblong tube, quickly followed by the unmistakable pop of the ammunition as they hit their target.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

	In addition to having the properties of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet, this weapon is considered a +1 Weapon and gains two Eclipse Powers. During the day, the Weapon of the Sun and Moon can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Darkness spell; this version of the spell creates a 60-foot-radius sphere of darkness, instead of its normal size. During the night, it can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Daylight spell. Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

A creature in possession of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet can perform a 1-hour ritual (as if attuning to a magic item) to combine those items, forming the Weapon of the Sun and Moon.
	In addition to having the properties of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet, this weapon is considered a +1 Weapon and gains two Eclipse Powers. During the day, the Weapon of the Sun and Moon can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Darkness spell; this version of the spell creates a 60-foot-radius sphere of darkness, instead of its normal size. During the night, it can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Daylight spell. Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

This crossbow is fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the cartridge runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

A hoopak is a sturdy stick with a sling at one end and a pointed tip at the other.

Special: When you make a melee attack with this weapon, you ignore its ammunition property. You can use the hoopak as a martial ranged weapon. If you do, it uses the ammunition property, uses sling bullets, and deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

	In addition to having the properties of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet, this weapon is considered a +1 Weapon and gains two Eclipse Powers. During the day, the Weapon of the Sun and Moon can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Darkness spell; this version of the spell creates a 60-foot-radius sphere of darkness, instead of its normal size. During the night, it can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Daylight spell. Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

    <text>A creature in possession of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet can perform a 1-hour ritual (as if attuning to a magic item) to combine those items, forming the Weapon of the Sun and Moon.
	In addition to having the properties of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet, this weapon is considered a +1 Weapon and gains two Eclipse Powers. During the day, the Weapon of the Sun and Moon can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Darkness spell; this version of the spell creates a 60-foot-radius sphere of darkness, instead of its normal size. During the night, it can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Daylight spell. Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

Special: A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

A creature in possession of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet can perform a 1-hour ritual (as if attuning to a magic item) to combine those items, forming the Weapon of the Sun and Moon.
	In addition to having the properties of both the Lunar Weapon and the Solar Amulet, this weapon is considered a +1 Weapon and gains two Eclipse Powers.

Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
