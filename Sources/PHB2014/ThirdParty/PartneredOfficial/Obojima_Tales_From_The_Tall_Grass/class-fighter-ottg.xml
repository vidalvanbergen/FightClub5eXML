        <text>Even the life of a spirit must come to an end.
	Those who take on the moniker of a spirit-fused fighter do not normally do so by choice but rather by circumstance. Because to become a spirit-fused fighter, you must first become the vessel of a dying spirit, a task that can't be accomplished by choice, as no one truly understands how or why this occurs.
	All that is known is that the spirit's mind and body have passed on, and its essence now coexists within the fighter, granting them abilities beyond the capability of a normal spirit. Those who can harness this power can channel the latent energy into objects, which produce a magical quirk or powerful attacks. These arcane tricks are how these unconventional warriors fight and are the reason they have garnered so much attention and interest on the island.

Arcane Quirk:
As the host of a powerful spirit, the magic within you can be strange and unruly. Though you've learned to control your powers, the arcane energy can still spark to life, often creating strange effects.
	Choose one or more of the Arcane Quirks listed below:

	• When activating any of the features from this subclass, First Age technology around you begins to act haywire.

	• Whenever you make a weapon attack, a radio or cassette player on your person plays a snippet of a song.

	• Whenever you take damage you cough bubbles.

	• Spirits find your odor to be incredibly off-putting.

	• Spirits find your odor to be incredibly attractive.

	• When you are unconscious, your body floats 1 foot off the ground and can be carried by the wind.

	• When you successfully land a critical hit on a creature, your head randomly transforms into a strange visage such as an anthropomorphic pig head, a crimson-skinned version of yourself with flaming locks, the face of an Urugama, or a CRT TV. This transformation lasts until you transform again or take a long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Channel Essence (The Spirit-Fused (Third Party))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel spirit energy into your attacks. You have a pool of four d6s that you spend to fuel this ability, which are called essence dice.
	When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend a die from your pool to add it to the roll. Alternatively, you can expend a die from your pool to add it to the attack's damage roll. You can choose to do this either before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.
	You regain all of your expended essence dice when you finish a short or long rest.
	You gain an additional d6 for your essence dice pool at certain levels in this class: 7th level (5d6), 10th level (6d6), 15th level (7d6), and 18th level (8d6).

        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel your internal spirit energy into objects, creating an array of effects. You learn one Channeling Option of your choice (see "Channeling Options" below). In addition, you gain an object of your choice that you can use to channel the option through.
	Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
	You also gain proficiency in the Salvage skill.

        <text>Starting at 7th level, you learn the Jolt cantrip with the following changes:

	• When you target a machine with the spell, the machine is powered for 1 hour instead of 18 seconds.

	• Your spell attack modifier is equal to your Constitution modifier + your proficiency modifier.

Additionally, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with a weapon attack as part of the attack action, you can replace its damage with that of the Jolt cantrip. When you do so, you roll the Jolt cantrip's damage dice (which deals lightning damage) in place of the weapon's damage dice, and you can gain no other benefits to the attacks damage from other features or spells.
	You count as the spirit creature type.

When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to roll one of your essence dice, adding the number rolled to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

    <level>0</level>
    <classes>Fighter (the Spirit-Fused (Third Party)): Channeling Options</classes>
    <text>As a bonus action, you cause a bag (such as a canvas sack, backpack, fanny pack, or satchel) that you are holding or is on your person to rapidly inflate with air. The bag then floats upward, lifting you off the ground and carrying you up to 30 feet straight into the air. You hover in place there until you let go of the bag (no action required) or until the start of your next turn, at which point the bag gently floats back to the ground.
	Alternatively, when falling you can use your reaction to cause the bag to inflate, granting you the benefits of Feather Fall.

    <text>When taking the attack action, you can choose to replace one of your attacks with an entangling strike. Choose an object that features tendril-like properties (such as a tape measure, game controller, extension cord, rope, or chain). The object can be on your person or within 30 feet of you, provided you can see it.
	When you do so, the object springs to life, stretching out towards a creature you can see within 15 feet of it. Make a ranged attack using your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is pulled up to 15 feet towards the object.
