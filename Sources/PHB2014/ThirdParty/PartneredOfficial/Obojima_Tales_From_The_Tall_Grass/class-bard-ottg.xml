        <text>To be a bard from the College of Masks is to be a theater actor capable of losing themselves in a role by using masks they imbue with magic. Through these masks, bards can mimic others and even take on attributes of the personas their masks depict.
	To see the world through another's eyes. To show the world a face not your own. To become someone else. These are the actor's pursuits. Some local players might putter about on the stage as a hobby or distraction, but not bards of the College of Masks. Like liquid bronze being poured into a mold, these actors have turned their sense of self into a malleable thing able to transform themselves into someone else.

        <name>Tradition of Performance (College of Masks (Obojima) (Third Party))</name>
        <text>The College of Masks not only describes the bard, but it also refers to an Obojiman theater tradition where a solitary masked actor plays out a story from the island's myths and folktales, which feature a set of archetypal characters such as the Old Man, the Fish, and the Demon, among others. Throughout the show, the actor artfully shifts between masks depicting each character. Each performance is its own special thing, as no two are the same.

        <text>When you join the College of Masks at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave arcane boons into theater masks, which grant you abilities while you wear them. You craft two masks of your choice, which are detailed under the "College of Masks (Obojima): Masks" spell list. You're able to craft one additional mask of your choice when you reach 7th, 11th, and 15th level in this class. Each time you craft a new mask, you can also replace one mask you've already crafted with a different one.
	While wearing a mask you gain the abilities granted by it. You can don or swap masks as an action or bonus action. If an ability from a mask requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to your bard spell save DC.

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to quickly shift your appearance to match that of a person. As an action, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to cast the Alter Self spell, using the spell's Change Appearance option to transform into another humanoid you have seen. When cast in this way, the spell has the following changes:

	• It doesn't require your concentration, but you can still end the spell at any time (no action required).

	• You gain 5 temporary hit points, and the spell ends early if you lose all these hit points or die.

	• You gain new equipment that you would associate with the target and are aware of it possessing, such as its clothing, armor, weapons, and other small belongings. Any equipment gained in this way has no magical properties, even if the original object used by the target does.

	• Any equipment you were wearing or carrying merges into your new form and you can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of it.

        <text>At 6th level, you gain the ability to enthrall an audience with a dramatic performance. Over the course of 1 minute, you can engage in a captivating performance and attempt to cause nearby creatures to become charmed, frightened, or fall unconscious (your choice). Choose a number of creatures up to your bard level within 60 feet of you that can hear you. When the performance ends, each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be subjected to the chosen condition.
	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

        <text>At 14th level, you gain the ability to give one of your theater masks to an ally within 5 feet of you. As an action, you temporarily release the incantation that binds your theater mask to you, allowing one of your allies to use it. The mask can be used in this way for 1 minute and only one other creature can be designated to use it.
	Once you've given an ally a theater mask, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

	• Arcane Memory. While wearing this mask, you can use an action and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to magically learn whether a creature or object you specify has been within a 20-foot radius of your current location in the past 24 hours.

	• Demon Eye. As an action, you gain the ability to magically see through solid objects to a range of 15 feet. Your vision penetrates most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

While wearing this mask, you know the Speak with Dead spell. Additionally, you can expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to temporarily move through the Spirit Realm. Whenever you would move, you instead step through the veil and into the Spirit Realm in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Spirit Realm until you stop moving or your turn ends. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take 1d10 force damage.
	While on the Spirit Realm, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't in the Spirit Realm can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so. You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Spirit Realm, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from. This effect lasts until the end of your turn.
