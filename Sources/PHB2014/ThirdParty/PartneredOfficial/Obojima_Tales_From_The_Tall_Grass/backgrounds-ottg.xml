    <name>Apprentice of AHA (Third Party)</name>
    <proficiency>History, Investigation</proficiency>
    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>You spent time studying with the archaeologists, historians, and archivists of AHA, the group of adventuring academics who seek knowledge about the nature of Obojima and its past. With your mentor, you pursued answers to one of the island's mysteries. During your apprenticeship, you traveled to one or more of AHA's excavation sites and worked alongside the organization, but never became an official member. Even now, unanswered questions from your time with the group continue to rattle around in your mind.

	• Skill Proficiencies: History, Investigation
	• Tool Proficiencies: You gain proficiency in an Artisan's Tool of your choice.
	• Equipment: An Explorer's Pack, 5 candles, shovel, signal whistle, a journal full of old research from your time as an apprentice, and 13 gold flowers.

Note:
If a player chooses an apprentice background for their character, it doesn't mean they are full members of that faction. An apprentice witch, for example, learned under a witch for a time, but it doesn't mean that character was inducted into a coven yet. It does mean that the apprentice had a mentor, though. Work with that player to figure out who their character's mentor or mentors were, and determine what that character's current level of involvement is with that faction.

    <proficiency>Arcana, Survival</proficiency>
    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The ways of witchery are mysterious and often guarded by its practitioners. Whether you sought it out or a witch recognized something in you, you came to apprentice for a witch or coven. Under their tutelage, you were introduced to Obojima's folk magic tradition, where you learned the rudiments of potions and other magical preparations. Although you may have trained under one for some time, you never officially joined one of the covens and are considered a witch without a crest.

	• Tool Proficiencies: Alchemist's supplies
	• Equipment: Alchemist's supplies, 9 common ingredients (which you know the attributes for), a hat or robe from your time as an apprentice, and 9 gold flowers.

      <text>You have a knack for machines and can tell what state one is in by spending a few minutes with it. Machines that have been sundered are unusable and should be scrapped for parts.

    <proficiency>Persuasion</proficiency>
    <trait>
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Though everyone living on Obojima comes in contact with spirits to one degree or another, your interaction with the Spirit Realm has always occurred with peculiar regularity. All your life you've had a special kinship with spirits that few share in. You've come to love their food, their culture, and their people more than the average material being. These habits have drawn fascination, suspicion, and confusion from locals, but that doesn't stop them from enlisting your talents when spirit stuff gets weird.

	• Skill Proficiencies: Mechanics, Persuasion
	• Languages: Torum
	• Equipment: A bedroll, 10 candles, two different common ingredients (linked to your spirit allies), a special item gifted to you by a spirit, and 10 gold flowers.

      <name>Feature: Connections Beyond Material</name>
      <text>You have come to know two spirits by name, and through your relationship have learned special rituals and techniques that allow you to find them across the Physical and Spirit Realms.
	By using two unique ingredients that you choose when taking this background, you can contact these spirits from any distance or plane of existence. The ritual you enact to utilize these ingredients and contact a spirit is uniquely your own—it might involve a tea ceremony, or perhaps the burning of the ingredients and partaking in the aromatic smoke they produce.</text>
