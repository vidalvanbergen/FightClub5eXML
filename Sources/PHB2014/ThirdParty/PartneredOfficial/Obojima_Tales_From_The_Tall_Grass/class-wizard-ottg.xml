        <name>Arcane Tradition: Origami Mage (Third Party)</name>
        <text>Origami Mages are wielders of a unique form of magic that combines precision, creativity, and imagination. With a flick of their wrist and a whisper of arcane words, they transform simple sheets of paper into awe-inspiring manifestations of elemental forces, mystical beings, and fantastical creatures.
	Drawing inspiration from the mysterious elegance of origami, these mages are not bound by traditional spell components but instead rely on the meticulous manipulation of paper to channel their magical energies. Origami magic is not without its challenges. Mastery of this arcane discipline demands patience, dexterity, and a keen eye for detail. Each fold must be precise, each crease exact, for even the smallest imperfection can disrupt the flow of magic and render a spell ineffective. Yet, for those who persevere, the rewards are boundless.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>An Arcane Art (Origami Mage (Third Party))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you learn to weave magic into origami, allowing you to create magnificent moving art pieces, which act on your behalf. As a bonus action, you can fold and imbue life into a paper construct that takes a form you choose from the Origami Mage Origami Constructs spell list. When crafted, an origami construct becomes bound to you or another creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you.
	A creature with a bound origami construct gains the unique effects and features listed for that construct. A creature can't have more than one of the same origami construct bound to it at a time, unless stated otherwise. A bound construct occupies the same space as the creature it's bound to.
	These constructs stay imbued with life for a number of hours equal to half your wizard level. Origami constructs have an AC equal to your spell save DC, are immune to poison and psychic damage, and are destroyed when they take any damage. You can use this feature to create an origami construct a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Origami Familiar (Origami Mage (Third Party))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you learn the Find Familiar spell; you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. Your familiar appears as an origami version of itself, is immune to poison and psychic damage, and is a construct, instead of a celestial, fey, or fiend. In addition to the familiar's normal statistics, it also gains access to the following abilities.

Camouflage. You can command your familiar to shift into a flattened paper form. In this form the familiar looks nearly indistinguishable from a normal piece of paper. If a creature uses its action to examine the familiar, it can discern the familiar for what it is with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. The familiar can use an action to shift back into its origami form.

Last Resort. As an action, your origami familiar can dive toward a creature, unfurling itself and wrapping around the target's face, as if a sheet of paper blown by the wind. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded by the paper or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is no longer blinded. When this effect ends, your familiar is destroyed.

Reconnaissance. As an action, you can command your familiar to spy. The origami familiar will then spend 1 minute listening to any and all sounds within 15 feet of itself, recording what is overhears on its paper body. It then returns to you and dispels its familiar form, leaving behind a transcript of its findings written in a language of your choice that you know.

        <text>Beginning at 10th level, you learn the Unseen Servant spell; you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but the maximum number of servants you can have at a time is equal to half your wizard level (rounded up). When you cast it, it has the following changes:

	• The spell lasts for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus, instead of 1 hour.

	• Your servant appears as a visible origami version of itself.

	• Your servant is immune to poison and psychic damage.

	• Your servant can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing

	• When you use your bonus action to command a servant, you can issue a unique command to each servant you have created as part of the same bonus action.

	• Your servant falls at a rate of 60 feet per round and takes no falling damage.

	• Your servant can see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible.

	• As an action, while your servant is within 100 feet of you, you can see through your servant's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the servant has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

	Additionally, when one of your constructs would take damage, you can use your reaction to negate the damage against it. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
