    <description>Unique among spirits are those, that for one reason or another, are drawn to possess inanimate objects. Though sages remain uncertain why spirits choose certain objects, it is widely agreed that spirits appear to prefer items that are meaningful to people. A spirit might linger in one object, or move from one to the next the way a hermit crab moves from shell to shell over the course of its life.
	Objects possessed by spirits become animated, allowing the spirit to interact with the Physical Realm. Once a spirit has chosen an object to be its vessel, it regards it as part of itself and won't possess other objects.

    <description>Beast spirits may or may not be the most common type of companion. Many household pets are treated as though they were spirits, and some spirits prefer to remain anonymous to their chosen person. It is perhaps the ambiguous nature of their presence that has led many Obojimans to regard pets with a semi-reverence.

    <description>Unlike their land-bound counterparts, flying spirits tend to keep a degree of distance from settlements, while not altogether rejecting them. People are fascinating, and flying spirits prefer to watch from a distance. It's not uncommon for a person to claim they are being watched by the same owl or followed by the same chicken every day. When the time is right, the spirit will reveal itself to their chosen person.

    <description>Spirits of this variety can resemble all kinds of foliage. They get a form as they enter the Physical Realm, growing into it as though they were actual flora. They might be mistaken for a plant or mushroom at a cursory glance, but anyone paying attention will notice that they have arms, legs, and expressive little faces.
	Flora spirits tend to see the plants or fungus that resemble them as kindred, and they are most often found tending the places where they appeared. However, some leave their familiar soil, venturing forth to roam the island.
	The table below has a list of examples of forms a flora spirit might take. Feel free to create your own.

    <description>Although their name implies a small, nut-sized creature, acorn crabs are enormous land crabs that have a penchant for climbing into trees and dining on acorns. They are territorial and will defend their trees, sometimes falling from great heights and using their shells as battering rams to smash interlopers far below.

    <description>Akaobata are hoarders and covetors of truths and secrets. Reveling in the power and delight brought from knowing some unknown truth about another person-especially if that secret causes great consternation.
	Though the stories of the Akaobata aren't well known among the islanders, those who do know of the spirit will advise you to keep out of the affairs of such a creature—Failing to do so will have you engrossed by its cursed games, unaware of how to escape.

Akaobata's Gift:
Akaobata is said to approach a creature and offer a gift in exchange for an answer to their question. These gifts are rumored to be as simple as a meal in desperate times, or as lavish as a priceless piece of art. The gift however should not be of concern to the creature whom the Akaobata has parleyed with, but rather its question. As for most, the question of the nefarious spirit is often unanswerable, and the Akaobata will only accept the truth.
	The bargain must be honored if a deal is struck with an Akaobata. If the deal is broken, the consequences can be disturbing.

Broken Deal:
If a creature is unable to answer the Akaobata's question, the spirit will haunt the deal breaker until its side of the bargain is fulfilled — a process the Akaobata enjoys more than anything else. These haunts have started with minor pestering and stalking, to devious tricks and dangerous actions.

In Death:
If an Akaobata has struck a bargain, until that bargain is met, death on the physical realm is only temporary — Over time it will eventually return to its gravesite — a process that can take days or even months. Once returned, it seeks out the fulfillment of its unfulfilled bargains, often reinvigorated by actions one has taken to flee its question.

    <description>The fur-covered bearracuda fish live on the snowy slopes of Mount Arbora and are synonymous with the dangers of traveling at the heights of the mountain. Though the practice is uncommon now, there was a time when large bands of fisherman and trackers would hunt the predator for its meat and furs, but due to the practice's high casualty rate and the rise in popularity of potion crafting, it became easier and more lucrative for islanders to go after smaller fish.

    <description>Cats are beloved creatures on Obojima—They are among the most loyal of companions, skilled workers, and, in some cases, even peers to other islanders. To most, a cat's life is considered too short, but that is not the case for all cats. When a cat lives beyond its years, there is sometimes a transformation that can occur. Rather than fading away, the cat continues to flourish, growing stronger and larger, over several years, until eventually, they gain a status: cat of prodigious size.
	This transformation is just one of many that the cats of Obojima can go through and is regarded as one of the rarest.

    <description>Viota is a powerful spirit that takes the form of a little girl made of black smoke. She has hundreds of bodies, all of which look like this same unsettling and somehow disarming young lady. Each of her clones has a unique personality and is living out its life somewhere on the island. Though each of these clones has a different personality, some of which are kind and caring, while others are dangerous and cruel, they are all connected. What one clone experiences, so do the others.

Member of Society:
Viota goes by many names and holds hundreds of professions. She lives on every corner of the island and dines with all types of people, very few of which, truly understand what Viota is. In one town, she might be a young witch apprentice studying to join a coven alongside dozens of other students. In another settlement, she might be the guard captain or owner of the local inn. At all times, she is loved, hated, admired, and feared by those around her.

Danger to Society:
Not every one of Viota's clones are kind individuals—Some are quite the opposite. They can be as cruel and manipulative as a demon or as dangerous and wild as a feral beast. Some of these clones have found ways to live within the confines of society, while others are cast out to the areas of the island that few people wish to travel to. It's these clones that most wish to avoid at all costs.

Mystery of her Magic:
At some point in the last few decades, an unknown witch was able to tap into Viota's magic and summon one of her clones through the use of the Shadow Child potion. To this day Viota is unsure how this happened and does whatever she can to stop the use of that potion.

    <description>Corrupted muk are shallow mockeries of humanoid form that emerge from pools of Corruption to wander about. Apparently mindless, corrupted muk don't seem to have any agency, but they can suddenly act as a single entity if alerted.

Muk-Filled Mystery:
Only a week after the tsunami brought the Corruption onto the eastern side of the island it began to move and gradually coalesce into more and more human-like forms that then huddled together or shambled about in a seemingly mindless manner. Some who have encountered corrupted muk have speculated that the Corruption may have some intelligence, trying to mimic life. Some temple sages have said that each corrupted muk is an Obojiman who was taken in the disaster and that each muk slain is a spirit released back to the island.

If the Deep Angler dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement.</text>

    <description>This enormous, predatory fish has the uncanny ability to cast an illusion around its lure to fit what its prey most responds to. A curious adventurer might see a floating chest of treasure, a swimmer in distress, or an empty boat floating on the surface—whatever gets its prey to come a bit closer for a better look. The deep angler has even been known to lunge onto the shore to swallow its prey, and then wriggle back into the water, making anything on the shoreline fair game.

    <description>Demons are corrupted spirits, banished from the Spirit Realm and left to wander the physical world. There are a wide variety of demons that range in type as widely as spirits do.

Tormented:
For the most part, demons cause varying forms of disturbance and mayhem as their unsettled nature cannot abide beauty, silence, or stillness. Many believe that demons can be released from the curse of their nature and returned to their spirit form by resolving their turmoil and healing their past, but that is a belief held by few who that have come to meet a demon in their lifetime.

Path to Exile:
There are many strange and contorted paths to becoming a demon, but the tale as old as Obojima, is that of the spirit who stepped beyond a line set in stone by natural order. When this creature becomes truly cruel, filled with malice, and devoid of love and its body becomes too weak to hold the wickedness festering inside itself — it starts its transformation.
	Rumors say that under certain circumstances, even physical beings can become demons, but it takes a long time for their obsessions and perceptions to warp them beyond their humanity and into demonic form.

    <description>The dragons on Obojima come in all sizes, shapes, and demeanors. Some are playful, some are lazy, some are sagacious, and some are downright dumb. There are dragons that live high in the mountains or deep underground, and there are dragons that roam around and might take up residence in a farmer's barn or curl up under a bridge. Dragons can be animalistic and they can also be intellectual, so it's always good to know what kind of dragon you're encountering before you attempt to commune with one.

Honored Guests:
Most Obojimans believe that dragons are guardians of the island, and there are many legends that tell of dragons bringing good luck, good fortune, and other supernatural boons to people and to the land. A dragon that takes up residence on a farm is afforded all the hospitality from a good scale scrubbing to home-cooked meals, and a dragon that lives within a hill overlooking a town is certain to have a shrine dedicated to it heaped with flowers, food, and other offerings.

Ancient Elders:
Across Obojima, temples and shrines to dragons are one way to encounter these massive and sometimes magical beasts but it's wise to remember that not all dragons are benevolent. Some dragons guard treasure or secrets and others may even find humans somewhat delicious. Some dragons have been on Obojima for a very long time and their memories can stretch back a thousand years or more. In that time, a dragon has seen generations come and go, making human needs and lives seem as insignificant as a leaf falling on an autumn evening.

    <description>Dragon Frogs are formidable monsters that once roamed the island as towering behemoths whose steps left villages in shambles—in today's age, they are the domesticated workhorse of the Nakudama people. For centuries the dragon frog has been shaped by Nakudama culture and desires, which in return have changed the creature irrevocably. In the Nakudama Age, it was common for dragon frogs to grow to heights of 60 to 100 feet tall; now the average dragon frog is no larger than a donkey.

Near Extinction:
During the Age of Nakudama, it became common for great warriors to hunt Dragon Frogs. In certain stories, this was also said to be a method by which one could gain knighthood from the queen. Although most records on this are lost, there is a document that has over a hundred written accounts of slain dragon frogs.
	Historians believe it was also during this time when the monarchy began to tame them.

    <description>Dustbunnies are relatively harmless, often pesky critters that live within towns and out on the plains and grasslands in deep burrows. There are many stories about dustbunnies, the most common one being a cautionary tale to keep your house or shop swept clean as it can quickly become overrun by dustbunnies. Some believe they were created by Obojima and are therefore good luck, so they allow the critters to multiply in droves, but many just think it an excuse to get out of housework. Whatever the case, most towns have their fair share of dustbunnies and live in relative harmony with them.

    <description>Field Giants are large and docile nature spirits known for crafting the winds that roll across the western foothills of the island. They're enthralled with how the gentle breezes interact with the world around them-Which is why they're often spotted gazing off in the distance. Because of this, locals have made a habit of placing pinwheels out on clotheslines to encourage the wind-making spirit to dry their garments.

Not Predator, Not Prey:
These giant spirits have grown to become one with the environment, yet they seem to take nothing from it. Unlike most creatures on Obojima, they need not sleep, or eat.

    <description>Fish folk are fish-like humanoid creatures who live under the Shallows in grottoes and caves. They are generally unpleasant and enjoy marauding along the coastline in their makeshift boats. To many Obojiman's they are considered the Howlers of the sea. While the overall number of fish folk is small, they are pesky, persistent, and opportunists. When they raid villages, they usually do so with a dozen or fewer bandits, and often when the villagers expect it least.

Fish Folk in General:
Most fish folk live in the Shallows and are divided into two kingdoms, those under the rule of the Lionfish King and deepsea fishfolk under the rule of Venomous Rex. Almost all deepsea fish folk are tainted by the Corruption and afflicted by its horrific, skeletonizing effects making them desperate and oftentimes unwell.

Villains and Cutthroats:
Both kingdoms of fish folk are pirates and bullies, demanding tribute from all who roam their waters. These threats are often hollow, but will do the trick, as most islanders would rather pay to end a fish folk interaction than to save a few gold.

    <description>The Lionfish King is proud, temperamental, and dangerous, yet not wholly beyond the reach of reason. His bristling mane of spines often betrays his mood—whether fair or foul. The Lionfish King's whims are like the weather and his cares range from himself, to the Corruption, to finding a royal bride, and back to himself again. For more on the Lionfish King, see "Domain of the Lionfish King" in the Locations chapter.

    <description>Of the many sea creatures that now call the sky their home, the giant jellyfish are regarded as some of the most beautiful. Travelers who have seen the migrations of the giant jellyfish time and time again are still awestruck when they arrive each year. The gentle giants are content to float gracefully on the wind, undisturbed by others, and a vision of tranquility to the world below-This is why artists over the years have used them as the source of inspiration for many iconic works of art on the island.

Festivals:
The most famous migration of giant jellyfish is also one of the largest festivals on Obojima-the Great Jellyfish Migration Festival that is held every year in Sky Kite Valley. At the end of summer, without fail, a vast school of giant jellies floats east to west across the Land of Hot Water, eventually hitting the peak of the great mountain. It's here where they complete their journey by rolling down the slopes of Mount Arbora, along the coastline of Sky Kite Valley, and out to sea. People from all over come to see this amazing event of spectacular beauty.

    <description>Giant Koi are enormous carp that languidly float through the sky. They don't appear to bother much with the land below other than to dip down to eat some grasses or shrubs from a hillside or mountaintop but most seem to never need food. The giant koi come in many different colors and patterns, and some have become famous over the centuries. There are some old books that describe giant koi that are floating through the skies today and it is unknown how long they live as they have no natural predators—at least until the arrival of the Hunter.

Bringers of Good Fortune:
Giant koi are revered and considered heralds of good fortune by most of Obojima's inhabitants. Even though giant koi roam the skies freely, they tend to stay around a certain place, becoming mascots of towns and villages that hold festivals in their honor, and it's common to see children (and adults) wearing giant koi fish hats and flying kites that look like their local giant koi.

Valuable Scales:
Although it is greatly frowned on, treasure hunters and witches go to areas where giant koi have been in hopes of finding a scale that has been shed from these magnificent creatures. There has only been one recorded giant koi that has fallen to earth as the result of predation by the Hunter. This resulted in the largest cache of giant koi scales ever taken which were then used to build a shrine dedicated to the great fish. Most other scales usually wind up in temples or shrines for all to see.

    <description>The Goro Goro, also known as the Sake Demon, is a dangerous and feared monster that stalks small settlements and towns-being one of the few creatures on the island that only eats humanoids. Its hatred for meats unflavored by the sweetness of alcohol has earned it its reputation for hunting drunkards leaving bars or parties.

Stories:
Before encountering a goro goro, people say they've seen a bottle of booze presented beautifully on a small table in the woods or even the raucous noise of a party calling their name just off the beaten path. Others, too drunk to comprehend the dangers, have walked straight to the sweet smell of the Goro Goro's giant sake cup, never to be seen again.

    <description>Hammer gulls are enormous gulls that are known for dropping large rocks on their prey—usually giant crabs and mollusks-to crack their shells and get at the flesh. But hammer gulls are not the brightest of birds and have been known to simply drop boulders on all manner of things including houses, boats, and beachgoers. Thus, hammer gulls are considered dangerous pests by Obojimans and are chased away if they get too close for comfort.
	There are some who have found ways to domesticate hammer gulls and use them as mounts by hatching one of their eggs and raising them by hand. These "gull-tamers" are known throughout Obojima as being a cast of odd characters, cut from a different cloth, and usually as loony as the gulls themselves.

    <description>The origin of harpies is shrouded in mystery. Some say they are cursed humans, a long-lost coven of witches who dabbled with forbidden magic. Others say that the harpies came to Obojima from beyond the horizon and are from a different world entirely. Whatever the truth is, what is certain is that harpies are generally raucous, aggressive, and uncouth. They are prone to acts of bullying, piracy, and they enjoy larceny in all its forms. They are often found in gangs of three or more, and rare is the harpy who speaks with a civil tongue and does not at some point resort to vulgarity or name-calling when dealing with others.
	Harpies see people as rubes (at best) and as food (at worst). Harpies enjoy tormenting the innocent, and the more sheltered and naive the person is, the more the harpies enjoy shocking them with their lack of couth and civility. The thing a harpy hates most is ambivalence, so the bigger the reaction, the more inwardly pleased a harpy is.
	Islanders think of the harpies as wretched souls who are best left alone to their own wickedness. They are considered cursed and magical creatures, so some witches are curious to know if things like a harpy's spit, a talon, a lock of hair, or a feather would have some magical properties for brewing potions, but to this day, no one has been willing to take the risk to find out.

    <description>Hill dragons are notoriously aggressive and territorial—Which paired with their long hunting treks throughout the Gale Fields, has earned them a "flee on sight" command by the Courier brigade. They often accumulate a layer of sod, dirt, and debris on their backs, which bonds with their claylike bodies. This hallmark grassy coat of the hill dragon is not just an outcome of their life sleeping in the fields but also perfect ambush camouflage when hunting the fast and elusive Sheep Dragon.

Eggs:
Looking like pumpkin-sized acorns, hill dragon eggs can remain dormant in the ground for a year or more before they hatch. Hill dragon eggs are usually buried out of sight, but certain flowers like to grow around burial pits giving their positions away, and egg-hunting hogs can be trained to sniff them out.
	Not known for powerful maternal instincts, hill dragons lay their eggs in clutches all across the plains, dales, and rolling hills of Obojima.

    <description>Howler Yippers are the bottom of the pecking order in a howler pack making them both craven and surly. Yippers spend their limited brain power bullying, stealing, and generally messing around. Most yippers work hard to curry favor with their superiors by bringing offerings and heaps of flattery, but it is in their nature to do acts of mischief and destruction, so they inevitably incur wrath and punishment from their elders.

Howlers:
Howlers are monsters, and if there's one thing in all of Obojima that gives villagers the most grief and worry, it's howlers. They're responsible for more raids on farmhouses, stolen livestock, and pillaged wagons than any other creature on Obojima.
	Howlers are fairly large, hyena-like humanoids that live in endlessly squabbling packs led by the most crafty or the most combative among them. Most of the howler population live in burrows and dens throughout the Gale Fields, but there are small gangs that live in the wildernesses all across Obojima.

Howler Worldview:
Howlers generally see the rest of the world as resources to be taken or a toy to be played with. They have little empathy, which is why they don't see an issue with taking something they want, even if that means robbing and stealing to get it. Their main desires are food, territory, and trophies to impress their pack and their leader, known as "snarlers"
Howlers sleep when their snarler does, and even then it's only for a few hours a day, so they are almost always active in seeking whatever will get them more favor and status within the group.
	A howler clan can be a mix of scheming, toadying, raucous, and indifferent, with brief bursts of showboating from their snarler to establish dominance.

Rogue Howler:
Not every howler belongs to a pack, and these "rogue" howlers are among the most aggressive and dangerous and are often the ones that cause concern among villages.

Public Enemy:
Most Obojimans know of howlers and it is one of the reasons why villagers take at least some instruction from the sword schools or resident fighters so that they can defend their crops, livestock, and merchandise. Despite the warnings, there are always those who believe howlers are misunderstood and just need a hug, but more often than not, they come back from their missions of mercy missing teeth or not at all.

    <description>Howler Snarlers are often the leaders of howler packs due to their great strength and keen intellect but they are also the ones most susceptible to flattery and greed. A snarler's day is spent showing the clan just how much of a snarler they are-bossing other howlers around, making big barking sounds, and leading raids to get food and loot.
	A snarler's life is usually short, often ending in betrayal at the hands of the next snarler or failure of a grandiose stunt.

    <description>Although howlers are pack monsters, some howlers shy away from the clan, preferring to lurk in the scrublands or in the darkness where they can move unseen and more easily ambush prey. These howler stalkers are the ones that you don't hear barking a mile away and that you don't see coming. While the pack as a whole can take down large game once every several outings, the stalkers may not take down a massive beast, but they never return empty-handed.
	Snarlers and stalkers have a tenuous relationship within howler clans, and it's often a threat for snarlers to have more than a handful of stalkers in a pack as snarlers always like to know where their enemies are coming from.

    <description>The Hunter is the second of the "Three Great Beasts" of Obojima—a title given to the creatures that are said to be chosen by the island as its protectors. The Hunter is the largest among the three: a towering stork that swallows whole the Giant Koi that float through the sky and creates violent crashing waves when it glides across the ocean surface. It is the embodiment of natural beauty and is regarded by the islanders as a symbol of Obojima's will.

Historic Past:
The Hunter has been roaming Obojima for centuries. Historic records claim that the Hunter first appeared during the Age of Nakudama, where it fought a colossal sea snake that had wrapped itself around the top of Mount Arbora. This is just one of the great beast's many feats, as tales throughout history speak of the Hunter's triumphs.

Truth or Legend?
The Hunter, like all of the great beasts, is an animal, and it obeys its natural desires and needs. However, most islanders assign the Hunter goals which they think it has come to the island to achieve. The most common of these ideas is that the Hunter was summoned by the island to protect its people from whatever is beyond the Shallows.

    <description>Kafuka are small and meek bird-like humanoids that live all across the island-The polar opposite to the rowdy harpies. They claim a small copse of trees, which they call their domain, and it is here that they rule over the tiny woodland creatures that happen to wander through. Though the Kafuka often keep to themselves, if a creature were to disturb their domain, they're known to be quite cruel and unrelenting—Going as far as branding children as punishment.

The First of its Kind:
The first of the Kafuka were said to once be children, who, at some point, were cursed by the island as punishment for their misdeeds. These stories still propagate on the island, but it's more common for people to believe them to be one of the many odd creatures that inhabit the woods.

    <description>Lion's blume is a most peculiar and troublesome plant, feared by beekeepers yet sought after by brewers. Its golden-hued petals are charming to the eye, but at the very heart of this plant lies a gaping maw, ready to snap shut upon any unfortunate bee (or beekeeper) that strays too near. Beekeepers often speak ill of the lion's blume, calling it a weed, for it decimates their hives with alarming efficiency.

Pride and Prejudice:
The flower grows in clusters, known as "prides," scattered across the windy moors of the Coastal Highlands. Each pride has its own family, or lineage, and it is quite common to find them in silent battle, their roots entwined in a fierce competition, each trying to choke the life from neighboring prides. Because of this natural competition, being kind to one lion's blume plant may incur the jealous wrath from its nearby neighbors.

Dangerous but Useful:
Despite its ill reputation, brewers hold the lion's blume in high regard. Its milky sap is prized for concocting rare and curious beverages, while the sharp, tooth-like structures within the flower are often harvested for other uses. Thus, though many may curse its presence, there are those who wander the moors in search of the elusive lion's blume, ever mindful of its significant bite.

    <description>Mosslings are shy woodland spirits that are easily mistaken for clumps of vegetation or small, moss-covered stones. Because they are inquisitive, mosslings will follow a band of travelers while doing their best to remain camouflaged. If befriended, mosslings have also been known to show adventurers hidden areas of the forest that are sacred or magical as well as give them trinkets from the forest to mark their friendship. Mosslings are almost always found in groups but each has their own quirky personality.

    <description>Pixies are mischievous spirits that enjoy interacting with the Material Realm. Pixies feed off of emotions, so it is generally the case that the more frustrated or reactionary one gets with them, the more they respond by being naughty and insolent. The more stoic and implacable one is, the more relaxed and agreeable the pixies are.
	They're considered the definition of a pest spirit, which is why most Obojimans tolerate pixies at best and despise them at worst.

    <description>A postal knight is an elite member of the Courier Brigade, an order of knights dedicated to the protection and delivery of parcels. Operating in small squads, they brave treacherous roads, bandit ambushes, and magical hazards to ensure that vital packages reach their destinations.
	Sworn in through a ceremonial oath, these warriors embrace the motto, "Deliverance through delivery" and the rigorous training it takes to become a knight reflects their dedication to their sacred task.
	The ranks of the Courier Brigade are led by the Postmaster General, a figure of great respect, who oversees operations from the guild's headquarters in Yatamon. Most of their ceremonies take place in the First Age city and at Fort Harglo in the Gale Fields.
	Obojimans as a whole respect and support postal knights and it is well known that every postal knight has a home anywhere on the island—all they have to do is knock and food and shelter shall be theirs.
	Though their purpose may seem humble, postal knights take great pride in their service, embodying the true spirit of guardianship. For them, every delivery makes a difference.

    <description>Terrifying tales of seaweed elementals are told in many of the taverns along the Obojiman coastline—sailors wrapped in swaths of green kelp and being dragged to the bottom of the Shallows are a common thread in stories that send chills down the spine. For the most part, the Shallows are clear of kelp, so spotting a seaweed elemental is easy for a vigilant sailor, but for those who wish to explore the underwater realm, a seaweed elemental is a serious threat, especially if one wanders into its domain.

    <description>These playful creatures are known to live among the rolling hills alongside livestock and other grazing beasts. Although their name and serpent-like body might confuse some, the sheep dragon is not a dragon, but rather more akin to a dog. These odd creatures aren't known to be violent but do have a variety of tools to protect themselves when they feel they're in danger.

Iconic Symbol:
The sheep dragon is often regarded as the epitome of goodness and authenticity on the island. Their seen as a symbol of freedom and unwavering kinship, which is why their likeness can be found all throughout villages and towns as a way to let travelers know they're welcome.

    <description>The Sky King is the first and the oldest of the "Three Great Beasts" of Obojima—and perhaps the oldest being on the island. Its age is so great that its body, which was once a majestic glistening shark with a blue hue that was said to make the skies look dull, is now rendered to cartilage and bone. Still, the great beast continues to soar through the clouds and dive below the waves—the island's magic keeping the king's body intact.

Historic Past:
It's said that the Sky King was once the great protector of Obojima—in an age when the Hunter was just a hatchling and the island was at war. The Sky King was a vigilant guardian who helped the Nakudama people and saw the end of a demonic rule over the island. Since that time, the Sky King has become more recluse. Its once watchful gaze over the island has subsided, aiding in the rise of the Hunter's role as the protector and adding to the mystery and intrigue that now permeates around the Sky King.

Truth or Legend?
Many believe that the Sky King is being kept alive by the Obojima for some reason. These rumors and stories have spread all across the island for hundreds of years and have been the catalyst for many famed adventurers and explorers to uncover the truth behind the Sky King and its mysterious past.

    <description>Jumaga is the third and youngest of the "Three Great Beasts" of Obojima-Though its reputation is considerably less prestigious than that of its counterparts. Most would consider Jumaga to be the most reckless and unpredictable of the islands chosen three, a sentiment supported by Jumaga's actions. In the Age of Dara alone, Jumaga has caused many disasters, from avalanches to tsunamis, and forest fires alike—each incident painting Jumaga differently. At one point, Jumaga was even seen entangled in a brawl with the Hunter, a fight which lasted several days. Still, the Great Beast has garnered the respect of the Islanders.
	Unlike the Sky King or the Hunter, Jumaga calls a portion of the island its domain. It is here that the locals have found a symbiotic relationship with Jumaga, and in doing so, shown a new side to the Great Beast.

The Last Century:
In the last 100 years, Jumaga has seemingly satiated its reckless and wild desires, its bestial actions now seen by islanders as almost ceremonial. Its domain has also become a sight in which islanders pay respect, leaving behind at the ledge of offering valuables, which they hope will please the great beast, and hide their cattle from Jumaga's view.

    <description>Slaggers are thought to be ancient elemental beings born from the merging of magma and earth spirits deep in the mines. Many miners believe they are the jealous guardians of Obojima's riches, which is why miners must tread carefully in their domain. While not inherently malevolent, their moody and territorial nature makes them unpredictable. Miners often leave offerings of coal, hoping to avoid the destructive wrath of the slagger. There's more than one story of an entire mine being abandoned due to the stubbornness of one particularly irritable and enormous slagger.

    <description>Green slimes live in wet and damp places, jungles, caverns, and deep underground where the moistness soothes and softens their prickly, acidic skin. Green slimes are notoriously terrified of everything. They're capable of forming spike-like appendages which it uses to move with an uncanny agility and they can also shed parts of its body as distractions to predators and ingredient hunters while they scurry away to safety.

Slimes:
On Obojima, witches, warlocks, and wizards have long studied the wonders of slimes. Their strange, natural properties have been an object of fascination for centuries, and harnessing their powers has been an ongoing alchemical pursuit that has left more than one would-be potion brewer missing their eyebrows or a finger.
	Slimes are intelligent enough to know that they are sought out for their properties, so most of them are furtive and will scatter at the first sign of an ingredient hunter. Each slime has adapted clever and explosive ways of deterring and escaping from various forms of danger.
	Although most Obojimans don't travel that far from their villages, almost all have heard of slimes as every school kid gets a lecture about the peculiarities and dangers of slimes.

    <description>Due to their stomach-churning stench, many yellow slime stories are told with visible distress at even the memory of the encounter. In its undisturbed state, yellow slimes smell slightly vile, but disturb it through careless footfalls or poke it with a stick, and it spurts out jets of foulness that can nauseate even the most iron-bellied of companions. Many children who are in the Society of Young Stewards have their "yellow slime story" that they are more than eager to tell.
	Yellow slimes are partial to swamps and forests where rotting wood and decaying leaf-litter is readily available.

Most orange slimes explode before a witch can carefully collect it or, if found near a village, a mage can be called to safely dispose of it. In and around Mount Arbora, there have been stories of orange slimes big enough to blow up a house or blast a hole in a stone wall.
	Orange slimes are sticky and gelatinous and have a signature acrid odor. They can be found near fumaroles and bubbling sulfur springs. They range widely in size and there are some Obojimans who make a business out of collecting tiny bits of orange slime to put in firecrackers.

Slimes:
On Obojima, witches, warlocks, and wizards have long studied the wonders of slimes. Their strange, natural properties have been an object of fascination for centuries, and harnessing their powers has been an ongoing alchemical pursuit that has left more than one would-be potion brewer missing their eyebrows or a finger.
	Slimes are intelligent enough to know that they are sought out for their properties, so most of them are furtive and will scatter at the first sign of an ingredient hunter. Each slime has adapted clever and explosive ways of deterring and escaping from various forms of danger.
	Although most Obojimans don't travel that far from their villages, almost all have heard of slimes as every school kid gets a lecture about the peculiarities and dangers of slimes.

    <description>Corrupted slimes are strange and unpredictable, as not much is known about how the Corruption affects the various slimes. But the most dangerous thing about them is that they can potentially spread the Corruption to whomever they come in contact with.
	Corrupted slimes are glutinous and will adhere to their prey that becomes afflicted with a ghastly, growing weakness until it is removed or the slime is satiated.
	Outside of the rare bottle of it in some witch's grotto or a wizard's study, corrupted slime in the wild is only to be found in or near the Corruption zone on the eastern side of Obojima. Thus, it is virtually unknown to the island at large.

A creature within 5 feet of the spirits can pull a whelmed creature out of them by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check, freeing the creature on a success.

    <description>Snowball spirits are small, fist-sized spirits that are curious and playful. They can be found anywhere there is a thick blanket of snow and are easy to locate due to their clinking, tinkling laughter. But if a group of snowball spirits feel threatened they can swarm together to create a larger and larger snowball made up of their tiny bodies. The more and more grumpy a snowball spirit gets, the larger it grows, until it becomes a terrifying behemoth as big as a house. Even at this giant size, a snowball spirit is a surprisingly fast adversary that can shoot out snowballs like a cannon and can leap through the air to easily engulf a horse and rider.

    <description>Grape, Orange, Strawberry, and Cola, these ancient sodas and more can be found across the island, kept pristine by the magics of the First Age and Obojima. But when the magic protecting these delicious treats begins to spoil, a peculiar creature can start to form inside these colorful metal cans. Soda slimes have been the lament of adventurers and mages alike who have taken it upon themselves to explore the forgotten buildings left behind from the First Age. Also known by the name Sugar Slimes, these tiny oozes can be very territorial when they're not hibernating or searching for other slimes to consume.

    <description>Spirit:
Spirits are beings that have their origins in the Spirit Realm but they can be found living all across Obojima and they are as much a part of Obojiman society as all the other beings who live there whether human, elf, Nakudama, or dara.

From the Formless, Many Forms:
Spirits by their nature are immaterial but when in the Physical Realm, they take on material form to be as solid as anyone else. Many spirits look one way when in the Physical realm and look wholly different when they return to the Spirit Realm. When they take on a physical form, they usually mimic or incorporate some shape or characteristics of plants, animals, or minerals. A spirit may take on the form of a radish or a cat or a stone, but they can be of any size and coloration that the spirit chooses. Spirits seem to choose their form and stay happy with it but there are cases where a spirit may transform its shape or metamorphose into another form, when this happens, it is usually a result of some magical evolution, the removal of a curse, or the movement from one realm to the other.

Here is a list of abilities a Spirit can have:
Some of these abilities may have an impact on the Spirit's Challenge Rating.

	• Commune with Animals. The Spirit can communicate with beasts as if they shared a language.

	• Ethereal Sight. The Spirit can see 60 feet into the Spirit Realm (Ethereal Plane) when it is on the Physical Realm, and vice versa.

	• Incorporeal Movement. The Spirit can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

	• Invisible. The Spirit is always Invisible.

	• Magical. The Spirit knows two cantrips and one 1st-level spell, which it can cast at will.

	• Ocular Prowess. The Spirit has Truesight out to a range of 30 feet.

	• Shift. The Spirit can enter the Spirit Realm (Ethereal Plane) from the Physical Realm, or vice versa.

	• Action: Spectral Pass. Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d8) force or necrotic damage.

    <description>Animalistic spirits are often far removed from society, taking comfort and respite with the wild animals of the island rather than the people. They can take many forms, but they almost always look like some version of a beastial creature. These spirits, unlike normal spirits, are less evolved and desire simpler lives. Because of this, they're seen by Obojimans (including other spirits) as lesser beings, more akin to the animals they commune with.

    <description>Pest spirits are usually the least intelligent of the spirits and are considered even by spirits as an unfortunate irritation to tolerate. Pest spirits are usually obsessed with a singular thing-gobbling sugary treats, tying things in knots, and your general compulsive thievery. They are normally innocent creatures without malice aforethought, simply compelled to do whatever it is that brings displeasure and annoyance to the rest of the island.

    <description>Stone Whale:
Although the stone whales were not the first sea creatures to take to the skies, they have done better than any at adapting to life above the ocean. Their friendly demeanor and natural affinity with surface flora have made a comfortable life on the island.

Island Culture:
Stone Whales have become significant to many islanders due to their migratory nature and the vegetation that grows on their backs. To some, stone whales serve as a method of travel. Wanders &amp; Merchants are known to use the great beasts for quick transport across the island. Others like witches and farmers utilize the plants that grow on the backs of the stone whales for tonics, elixirs, and potions. These whales are also known to carry vegetables and plants that might normally only grow in one section of the island, which is why many would jump at the opportunity to explore the back of a stone whale.

    <description>Stul are monstrous creatures that live in the central and eastern woodland. Known for their unsettling visage and mind-altering magics, they pose a serious threat to lone travelers or young children. Because of this, the islanders have worked tirelessly to run them out of the Gift of Shuritashi.

Myth:
It's said that the first stul was cursed into existence after a young Nakudama mage abandoned his companion spirit deep underground within the winding caves in Mount Arbora. By the time the companion resurfaced, its hardship had permanently altered it, leaving it with no recollection of its previous life, except for an innate feeling to call for its old friend

    <description>The Urugama are malevolent creatures that roam the countryside at night. Their terrifying laugh and wicked masks are so well known children's rhymes are written about them.

    <description>One of the most storied dangers of the Brackwater Wetlands comes in the form of a creature known as a vespoma. This canopy dweller resembles something between a bat and a monkey, and where there is one, there are often a handful of others. A vespoma is typically heard before it's seen, a fact that makes this creature so notorious, for the sound of its voice is laced with magic that compels its prey. Multiple vespoma harmonize, making their collective voice all the more potent. Vespoma are not simply hunters. They have a cruel nature and they are known to toy with their prey.
	Many stories are told of the vespoma's origin, but the most common opinion is that some time ago, a witch who lived in the Brackwater Wetlands taught these creatures the rudiments of spellcraft, which they then passed on to subsequent generations. Whatever the truth is, rangers familiar with the wetlands are known to warn travelers to avoid the voices in the trees.

    <description>Vile Corruption is the name given to one of the dangerous manifestations of living sicknesses that plague the eastern side of the island-A shapeshifting aquatic thing that terrorizes the Brackwater Wetlands, mimicking the creatures that live within the woodland and striking without cause or hesitation. Since its introduction to the environment, factions such as the Toraf and Boulder's sword school and the Rangers of the Greenward Path have been adamant about warning travelers to avoid the creature at all costs. Both organizations share the opinion that it is best to not get where you are going if it means keeping your life.

    <description>Only a handful of people on Obojima have seen the enchanted moving doorway. Every now and then, a ranger spots a wandering door while deep in the forest or a postal knight sees one running across the Gale Fields. Since no one has got close enough to a door to give a solid description, there's a good deal of speculation around if there is only one door or if there are multiple doors. To this day, no one really knows who enchanted these doors and no one has been able to catch one to study it.

    <description>Appearing as one of the island's many deciduous trees, the watchwood is known for terrorizing small settlements and villages throughout the Gift of Shuritashi. Their presence alone is enough to stop trade and travel to a location, which is why skilled woodcutters are often employed all over the island. Though watchwood trees can be dangerous, they're more of a threat during the warmer seasons, as they're easily spotted during the winter, when they're the only tree with leaves still on it.

    <description>Witches are found all over Obojima and are well respected amongst the people. Both covens and their members play a major role in the economy and ecosystem of the island.

Local Arcana Expert:
Witches are often seen as important members of the community, as they're understanding of magic is often desperately needed on an island full of magical happenings and peculiar occurrences. If a witch were to visit a town without a local magician, they would assuredly be buttered up and pampered during their stay.

Covens:
The six major covens of Obojima have lived harmoniously (for the most part) for the last 50 years, working alongside each other as allies in several major cities and settlements. Besides their regional ingredient expertise, each coven claims to have a unique set of skills that differentiates them from the others. But if you were to ask any islander, they'd probably struggle to tell you what those qualities are.

    <description>Yokairo are fantastical beings with feathered bodies that revel in the joy of chaotic mischief. Known for their lively nature and aggressive behavior these goblin-like creatures are often hated by villages. Their unwavering passion for music can lead them to disrupt festivals and other celebratory events, earning them a reputation not always well-received amongst islanders.

    <description>Mostly found in dense forests, Bora Bugs are natural engineers, using their sharp horns and spiked wing casings to carve out intricate paths on the earth. They work in large colonies, scouring smooth, winding trails. These paths often lead to hidden clearings, ancient ruins, or secret groves where forest spirits dwell. But bora bugs can also carve a path through houses and stone walls which is why many Obojimans see them as pests.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't Poisoned.

    <description>Blowbelly pufferfish are generally docile creatures but are easily startled. If they feel threatened, they inflate instantly to an enormous size. Anyone touching their prickly skin can get injected with doses of toxins. When a blowbelly pufferfish dies, they burst, sending a spray of poisonous spines in all directions.
	Blowbelly pufferfish are often found bobbing along coral reefs and on the sandy bottom of the sea.

This flesh then wriggles and grows, sprouting limbs and talons of its own as it struggles to its feet and lurches off into the forest to hunt. These are the Children of Malgrotha, and they tirelessly search the forest for their mother. They believe that every dara is the First Dara-the being that imprisoned their mother in the Crawling Canopy and who has the key to releasing them from this moving prison.
