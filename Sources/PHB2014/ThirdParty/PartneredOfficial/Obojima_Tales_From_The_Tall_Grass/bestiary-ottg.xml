    <description>Unique among spirits are those, that for one reason or another, are drawn to possess inanimate objects. Though sages remain uncertain why spirits choose certain objects, it is widely agreed that spirits appear to prefer items that are meaningful to people. A spirit might linger in one object, or move from one to the next the way a hermit crab moves from shell to shell over the course of its life.
	Objects possessed by spirits become animated, allowing the spirit to interact with the Physical Realm. Once a spirit has chosen an object to be its vessel, it regards it as part of itself and won't possess other objects.

    <description>Beast spirits may or may not be the most common type of companion. Many household pets are treated as though they were spirits, and some spirits prefer to remain anonymous to their chosen person. It is perhaps the ambiguous nature of their presence that has led many Obojimans to regard pets with a semi-reverence.

    <description>Unlike their land-bound counterparts, flying spirits tend to keep a degree of distance from settlements, while not altogether rejecting them. People are fascinating, and flying spirits prefer to watch from a distance. It's not uncommon for a person to claim they are being watched by the same owl or followed by the same chicken every day. When the time is right, the spirit will reveal itself to their chosen person.

    <description>Spirits of this variety can resemble all kinds of foliage. They get a form as they enter the Physical Realm, growing into it as though they were actual flora. They might be mistaken for a plant or mushroom at a cursory glance, but anyone paying attention will notice that they have arms, legs, and expressive little faces.
	Flora spirits tend to see the plants or fungus that resemble them as kindred, and they are most often found tending the places where they appeared. However, some leave their familiar soil, venturing forth to roam the island.
	The table below has a list of examples of forms a flora spirit might take. Feel free to create your own.

    <description>Although their name implies a small, nut-sized creature, acorn crabs are enormous land crabs that have a penchant for climbing into trees and dining on acorns. They are territorial and will defend their trees, sometimes falling from great heights and using their shells as battering rams to smash interlopers far below.

    <description>Akaobata are hoarders and covetors of truths and secrets. Reveling in the power and delight brought from knowing some unknown truth about another person-especially if that secret causes great consternation.
	Though the stories of the Akaobata aren't well known among the islanders, those who do know of the spirit will advise you to keep out of the affairs of such a creature—Failing to do so will have you engrossed by its cursed games, unaware of how to escape.

Akaobata's Gift:
Akaobata is said to approach a creature and offer a gift in exchange for an answer to their question. These gifts are rumored to be as simple as a meal in desperate times, or as lavish as a priceless piece of art. The gift however should not be of concern to the creature whom the Akaobata has parleyed with, but rather its question. As for most, the question of the nefarious spirit is often unanswerable, and the Akaobata will only accept the truth.
	The bargain must be honored if a deal is struck with an Akaobata. If the deal is broken, the consequences can be disturbing.

Broken Deal:
If a creature is unable to answer the Akaobata's question, the spirit will haunt the deal breaker until its side of the bargain is fulfilled — a process the Akaobata enjoys more than anything else. These haunts have started with minor pestering and stalking, to devious tricks and dangerous actions.

In Death:
If an Akaobata has struck a bargain, until that bargain is met, death on the physical realm is only temporary — Over time it will eventually return to its gravesite — a process that can take days or even months. Once returned, it seeks out the fulfillment of its unfulfilled bargains, often reinvigorated by actions one has taken to flee its question.

    <description>The fur-covered bearracuda fish live on the snowy slopes of Mount Arbora and are synonymous with the dangers of traveling at the heights of the mountain. Though the practice is uncommon now, there was a time when large bands of fisherman and trackers would hunt the predator for its meat and furs, but due to the practice's high casualty rate and the rise in popularity of potion crafting, it became easier and more lucrative for islanders to go after smaller fish.

    <description>Cats are beloved creatures on Obojima—They are among the most loyal of companions, skilled workers, and, in some cases, even peers to other islanders. To most, a cat's life is considered too short, but that is not the case for all cats. When a cat lives beyond its years, there is sometimes a transformation that can occur. Rather than fading away, the cat continues to flourish, growing stronger and larger, over several years, until eventually, they gain a status: cat of prodigious size.
	This transformation is just one of many that the cats of Obojima can go through and is regarded as one of the rarest.

    <description>Viota is a powerful spirit that takes the form of a little girl made of black smoke. She has hundreds of bodies, all of which look like this same unsettling and somehow disarming young lady. Each of her clones has a unique personality and is living out its life somewhere on the island. Though each of these clones has a different personality, some of which are kind and caring, while others are dangerous and cruel, they are all connected. What one clone experiences, so do the others.

Member of Society:
Viota goes by many names and holds hundreds of professions. She lives on every corner of the island and dines with all types of people, very few of which, truly understand what Viota is. In one town, she might be a young witch apprentice studying to join a coven alongside dozens of other students. In another settlement, she might be the guard captain or owner of the local inn. At all times, she is loved, hated, admired, and feared by those around her.

Danger to Society:
Not every one of Viota's clones are kind individuals—Some are quite the opposite. They can be as cruel and manipulative as a demon or as dangerous and wild as a feral beast. Some of these clones have found ways to live within the confines of society, while others are cast out to the areas of the island that few people wish to travel to. It's these clones that most wish to avoid at all costs.

Mystery of her Magic:
At some point in the last few decades, an unknown witch was able to tap into Viota's magic and summon one of her clones through the use of the Shadow Child potion. To this day Viota is unsure how this happened and does whatever she can to stop the use of that potion.

    <description>Corrupted muk are shallow mockeries of humanoid form that emerge from pools of Corruption to wander about. Apparently mindless, corrupted muk don't seem to have any agency, but they can suddenly act as a single entity if alerted.

Muk-Filled Mystery:
Only a week after the tsunami brought the Corruption onto the eastern side of the island it began to move and gradually coalesce into more and more human-like forms that then huddled together or shambled about in a seemingly mindless manner. Some who have encountered corrupted muk have speculated that the Corruption may have some intelligence, trying to mimic life. Some temple sages have said that each corrupted muk is an Obojiman who was taken in the disaster and that each muk slain is a spirit released back to the island.

If the Deep Angler dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement.</text>

    <description>This enormous, predatory fish has the uncanny ability to cast an illusion around its lure to fit what its prey most responds to. A curious adventurer might see a floating chest of treasure, a swimmer in distress, or an empty boat floating on the surface—whatever gets its prey to come a bit closer for a better look. The deep angler has even been known to lunge onto the shore to swallow its prey, and then wriggle back into the water, making anything on the shoreline fair game.

    <description>Demons are corrupted spirits, banished from the Spirit Realm and left to wander the physical world. There are a wide variety of demons that range in type as widely as spirits do.

Tormented:
For the most part, demons cause varying forms of disturbance and mayhem as their unsettled nature cannot abide beauty, silence, or stillness. Many believe that demons can be released from the curse of their nature and returned to their spirit form by resolving their turmoil and healing their past, but that is a belief held by few who that have come to meet a demon in their lifetime.

Path to Exile:
There are many strange and contorted paths to becoming a demon, but the tale as old as Obojima, is that of the spirit who stepped beyond a line set in stone by natural order. When this creature becomes truly cruel, filled with malice, and devoid of love and its body becomes too weak to hold the wickedness festering inside itself — it starts its transformation.
	Rumors say that under certain circumstances, even physical beings can become demons, but it takes a long time for their obsessions and perceptions to warp them beyond their humanity and into demonic form.

    <description>The dragons on Obojima come in all sizes, shapes, and demeanors. Some are playful, some are lazy, some are sagacious, and some are downright dumb. There are dragons that live high in the mountains or deep underground, and there are dragons that roam around and might take up residence in a farmer's barn or curl up under a bridge. Dragons can be animalistic and they can also be intellectual, so it's always good to know what kind of dragon you're encountering before you attempt to commune with one.

Honored Guests:
Most Obojimans believe that dragons are guardians of the island, and there are many legends that tell of dragons bringing good luck, good fortune, and other supernatural boons to people and to the land. A dragon that takes up residence on a farm is afforded all the hospitality from a good scale scrubbing to home-cooked meals, and a dragon that lives within a hill overlooking a town is certain to have a shrine dedicated to it heaped with flowers, food, and other offerings.

Ancient Elders:
Across Obojima, temples and shrines to dragons are one way to encounter these massive and sometimes magical beasts but it's wise to remember that not all dragons are benevolent. Some dragons guard treasure or secrets and others may even find humans somewhat delicious. Some dragons have been on Obojima for a very long time and their memories can stretch back a thousand years or more. In that time, a dragon has seen generations come and go, making human needs and lives seem as insignificant as a leaf falling on an autumn evening.

    <description>Dragon Frogs are formidable monsters that once roamed the island as towering behemoths whose steps left villages in shambles—in today's age, they are the domesticated workhorse of the Nakudama people. For centuries the dragon frog has been shaped by Nakudama culture and desires, which in return have changed the creature irrevocably. In the Nakudama Age, it was common for dragon frogs to grow to heights of 60 to 100 feet tall; now the average dragon frog is no larger than a donkey.

Near Extinction:
During the Age of Nakudama, it became common for great warriors to hunt Dragon Frogs. In certain stories, this was also said to be a method by which one could gain knighthood from the queen. Although most records on this are lost, there is a document that has over a hundred written accounts of slain dragon frogs.
	Historians believe it was also during this time when the monarchy began to tame them.

    <description>Dustbunnies are relatively harmless, often pesky critters that live within towns and out on the plains and grasslands in deep burrows. There are many stories about dustbunnies, the most common one being a cautionary tale to keep your house or shop swept clean as it can quickly become overrun by dustbunnies. Some believe they were created by Obojima and are therefore good luck, so they allow the critters to multiply in droves, but many just think it an excuse to get out of housework. Whatever the case, most towns have their fair share of dustbunnies and live in relative harmony with them.
