      <text>Dara are a mysterious people that emerged from the forests of Obojima less than 300 years ago. No one knows if they are from Obojima itself or if they came from another realm. Even the dara themselves speculate as to their origin, though most believe they are all descendents of an enigmatic figure known as the First Dara. What is known about the dara is that they are insatiably curious, a gift they claim is from their progenitor. Dara often gravitate toward being wanderers, seeking out anything that interests them, and many scrawl notes and sketches as they are observing. It's hard to know what a dara will be fascinated by next, as they are just as interested in a small bug trundling over a leaf as they are a sinuous dragon flying through the sky.

      <name>A Message from the Past</name>
      <text>Dara possess a unique gift—the ability to absorb a vast amount of information in an instant through contact with a magical glyph. These magical symbols, which resemble large fingerprints, are found on trees throughout Obojima and can only be seen by dara. A dara who touches one of these glyphs taps into its reservoir of knowledge. Through it, a dara could learn not just information, but also new skills. It is widely believed that many of these glyphs were left by the First Dara to guide future generations.</text>

      <name>Dara Lifecycle</name>
      <text>It's widely understood that one dara's life begins where another ends. When a dara is about to die, their final act is to capture what remains of their soul and store it into a single glyph, which they place upon a tree. Known as a parting glyph, it is imbued with the dying dara's identity, memories, and skills. There, the glyph waits until it can be claimed by a new dara.
	A dara is born from the earth, emerging into Obojima, fully formed, through the roots of a tree that bears a parting glyph. Most are born from trees in the sacred grove in Roa Kala, the ancestral homeland of the dara (see page 94 for more on Roa Kala), but it could be anywhere a dara has died. When a dara leaves the soil, they are a blank slate, aware and without identity until they touch the parting glyph found at the base of their tree.
	Parting glyphs give young dara a set of intellectual tools to function. In the form of memories, the glyphs offer the previous dara's perspective about a world yet to be experienced. For many dara, the parting glyph leads them to Roa Kala and from there they choose their new life.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

The elves of Obojima possess a deep and special bond with the enigmatic Spirit Realm and its native spirits. Unlike other inhabitants of the island, the elves do not form distinct communities or enclaves as they are not a people in the traditional sense. This is because elves are born to human parents. While this occurrence is uncommon, it is not so infrequent that it is met with disdain or apprehension. Instead, it's simply understood that an elf exists with one foot in two worlds.

Source:	Obojima: Tales from the Tall Grass p. 128 (Third Party)</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Slender and Graceful</name>
      <text>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.
	Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>A Timeless Perspective</name>
      <text>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.
	Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hidden Woodland Realms</name>
      <text>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).
	Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Exploration and Adventure</name>
      <text>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Marked by the Spirits</name>
      <text>Every elf shares common physical traits such as pointed ears and their keen ability to see in the dark. However, what sets Obojiman elves apart is the presence of Oaka Marks. Each elf bears a unique mark that symbolizes their connection to the Spirit Realm. These mystical glyphs appear as shimmering birthmarks and vary in size from that of a coin to large enough to cover an entire limb.
	Beyond being mere physical markers, Oaka Marks hold deep significance for elves. They represent their profound bond with the spirit world and have the potential to bestow unique supernatural abilities.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Spirit Guide by Circumstance</name>
      <text>Throughout the ages, the islanders and spirits have coexisted harmoniously, although it would be misleading to claim that they always agree on everything. Consequently, elves often find themselves acting as intermediaries when conflicts arise between spirits and folk from the Physical Realm.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Elf Names</name>
      <text>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.
	On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf's adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.

      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.</text>

      <name>Size</name>
      <text>Elves vary in height, which ranges from 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier:

Size modifier = 2d10
Height = 4 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches
Weight in pounds = 90 + (1d4 × your size modifier)</text>

      <name>Darkvision</name>
      <text>Thanks to your supernatural gifts, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</text>

      <name>Ethereal Sight</name>
      <text>Your ocular prowess doesn't stop at darkvision. Additionally, you can use an action to shift your sight into the ethereal, allowing you to see creatures on the Spirit Realm, which appear as glowing outlines of themselves. This effect lasts for 1 hour. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</text>

    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Trance</name>
      <text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>A sweet treat left untasted, a hot spring left undipped in, a warm fire left unshared—all considered tragedies by a people driven to indulge in all the comforts and curiosities Obojima has to offer. To the other peoples of the island, the amphibious Nakudama seem to partake in all things with a sense of eagerness and excitement.
	Nakudama tend to eschew enclaves for the more cosmopolitan settlements scattered across the island. They are highly social. Patrons of tea houses, taverns, and inns are sure to hear the booming, croaking voices of Nakudama mingling with crowds.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Did I Ever Tell You the Story About...</name>
      <text>Life is too short to spend time on anything not worth recounting in an over-the-top tale later. Sharing and collecting stories is among the most cherished Nakudama traditions. It's what motivates many Nakudama to travel the island or frequent social gatherings. A quality story doesn't just happen, however. Any Nakudama will tell you it's one part lived experience and two parts showmanship, which includes creative license and allows for at least a bit of exaggeration. The art can be practiced, but experience must be earned. Therefore, Nakudama tend to venture out regularly in search of novel stories to share.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Obojima's Earliest Inhabitants (Perhaps)</name>
      <text>Though the details have been lost to history or exaggerated over years of storytelling, it is generally believed that the Nakudama were the first people to call Obojima home. Several sites around the island point to an ancient Nakudama civilization, and many settlements appear to incorporate Nakudama architecture, which is noteworthy for its water features.
	Other evidence that suggests an earlier Nakudama Age comes from the tales, which are filled with the fantastical feats of a powerful Nakudama queen. Though often overly dramatic in the portrayals, her exploits seem to line up with recent archaeological findings.</text>
