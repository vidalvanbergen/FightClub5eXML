        <name>Roguish Archetype: Waxwork Rogue (Third Party)</name>
        <text>Waxwork rogues have a long history on the island of Obojima in dealing with the dangerous and the arcane. They're known for having an array of tools and tricks to delve into the most perilous of places and almost always coming back with treasures and tales. To a Waxwork rogue, any challenge or danger can be solved with a bit of wax, a pinch of smarts, and a whole lot of magic.

In the Beginning:
The Courier Brigade was created to carry packages between villages as well as guard merchant wagons through treacherous areas. But there are some areas on Obojima that are rife with the arcane, spirit dangers, and uncanny occurrences.
	Legend says that it was Lydia Starwright, Courier Brigade First Class, who, against all advice, sought out the aid of a powerful witch who was rumored to live within a hut of melted wax deep within the Land of Hot Water. It was there in that melted hut where the witch taught Lydia the arcane practices known only to certain spirits of the island, the ability to enchant wax and fire in wondrous ways. It was this knowledge that transformed Lydi into the first Waxwork Rogue.
	Lydia brought back this knowledge to the Courier Brigade, and formed the Waxworks Division, a dedicated group of arcane rogues who would volunteer for the most perilous assignments and deliveries of the Courier Brigade.
	In the present day, Waxwork rogues have transcended the ranks of the Courier Brigade, and their skill sets are practiced across the island.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Wax Enchantments (Waxwork Rogue (Third Party))</name>
        <text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn wax enchantments, which are fueled by your ability to pull and manipulate magic from the Spirit Realm. These are represented by a number of wick points.

Enchantments. You learn three enchantments of your choice, which are detailed under
the Waxwork Rogue Enchantments spell list.
	You learn two additional enchantments of your choice at 5th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new enchantments, you can also replace one enchantment you know with a different one.

Saving Throws. Some of your enchantments require creatures to make a saving throw to resist the enchantment's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Enchantment save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (your choice)

Wick Points. You have 3 wick points, which represent your current ability to harness the magic from the Spirit Realm. Manipulating the magic from another realm and pulling its energy into an object, even one as small and simple as a candle, can be both physically and mentally taxing. When you spend a wick point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you regain all of your expended wick points.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you gain 1 additional wick point.

When enchanted properly, it can temporarily hold any two objects together. As an action, you can spend 1 wick point to create an adhesive bond between two objects using just a small amount of bocha glue. The two objects remain bound together for 24 hours, at which point the enchantment fades and the two objects are separated. A creature within reach of the objects can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Enchantment save DC, breaking the bond early on a success.

At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    <text>Prerequisite: 10th Level Required

When you see a hostile creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell, you can use your reaction and spend 3 wick points to quickly ignite the flame of a thin white candle and cast Counterspell. If the spell was successfully countered and was 3rd level or lower, you can spend an additional 2 wick points to reactivate this ability and store the spell inside your candle.
	While holding the candle, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack modifier, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. Once the spell has been cast, the candle is sundered and becomes unusable. A spell can be stored inside a candle for 24 hours, after which the spell fades and is no longer able to be used.

As an action, you can spend 3 wick points to ignite and throw a dark black candle at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. A brilliant eruption of flame sweeps out from the candle, causing each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point to make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 2d6 fire damage and 2d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When you use this enchantment, you can spend additional wick points to increase the fire damage dealt by 1d6 for each additional wick point spent.
	The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

The candle continues to spew smoke for 1 minute and creates a visible trail in the sky that can be seen from 10 miles away.

It is flammable, and a 5-foot square of wax exposed to fire burns away in 3 rounds, dealing 2d6 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire. All spaces covered in the wax are difficult terrain for the duration.

	• In place of an animal familiar, you instead imbue life into a candle, which causes it to grow appendages and eyes.

	• Your waxling familiar uses the statistics of a rat.

	• You can command the familiar to use its action to touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried and ignite it.

	• The familiar sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

	• You can't temporarily dismiss the familiar.

	• The familiar is dismissed permanently after 1 hour or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.

	• You can have more than one of these familiars at a time.
