    <text>Special: When thrown, the boomerang returns to an unoccupied space adjacent to you. As a reaction, you can choose to catch it.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

	When you make a grapple check while holding the butterfly staff, you can use the staff to target a Small or smaller creature that is up to 10 feet away from you. When you do so, you use your attack modifier for the weapon in place of your Strength (Athletics) check. While grappling a creature in this way, you can't make another attack with the butterfly staff.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>The short and angular blade of a lom lom dagger was designed for cleaving and quickly became a staple in most of Obojima's kitchens. Over time, the blade length grew longer and longer, and eventually the lom lom dagger made its way out of the kitchen and into the hands of adventurers, who favored it for its balance and accuracy when thrown.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

	When you successfully hit a creature with a vertebrae sword, you can use a bonus action to rake and twist the weapon, breaking off some of the sword's boney barbs and dealing an extra 1d8 piercing damage. The vertebrae sword can only be used in this way 5 times before it becomes unusable as a weapon.

	As part of your movement, you can use the vaulter's axe to launch yourself 15 feet over a creature or obstacle. Using your movement in this way ignores nonmagical difficult terrain.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

No matter the contents, a skilled potion brewer can use the kit to sniff out the latent magic found in objects all across the island.

A creature can use its action to operate the glider, changing the direction they're moving and avoiding any obstacles in their path. If a creature is still in the air after 1 minute has passed, it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or let go of the glider, falling as it normally would. This saving throw is repeated every minute, with the DC increasing by 2 every time the saving throw is made (to a maximum of DC 20).

The hook can be hurled using a bonus action, and it requires an action to wind it back in before you can use it again. You can hurl the hook using only one hand, but it requires two hands to wind the hook back in. If the targeted surface has no lip to grasp or is otherwise too difficult for the barb to hook onto, the hook fails to latch onto it and pull you.
