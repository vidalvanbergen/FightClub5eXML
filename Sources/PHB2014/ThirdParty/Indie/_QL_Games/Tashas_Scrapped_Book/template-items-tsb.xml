    <text>The blade of this weapon is made from steeleaf, a magical material from the feywild. Grown on special trees, it is as light as a leaf but as sharp as steel. This weapon has the finesse property, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Attacking with this weapon while hidden does not reveal your position if the attack misses.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</text>
