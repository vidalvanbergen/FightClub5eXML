    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>These bracers have 3 charges. You can use an action to expend a charge and cast the conjure elemental spell. If one of the bracers is damaged, a charge can still be used to cast conjure elemental, but the elemental is initially indifferent towards your party, rather than friendly, does not count as being controlled by you, and may turn hostile at any time. If both bracers are damaged or broken, conjure elemental cannot be cast using this item. You may also use a reaction to expend a charge from these bracers to add +1 to your AC, damaging one of the bracers in the process. One bracer, or both bracers, can be repaired by severing your attunement to the bracers and re-attuning to them. If you use the last charge, roll 1d4. On a 1, the bracers implode, and a fire elemental, water elemental, earth elemental, and air elemental are all summoned as creatures that are hostile towards you. These bracers regain one charge daily at dawn.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Each bracer has 7 charges. Two bracers can be attuned using a single attunement slot, or each bracer can be attuned individually. If you have the elemental adept feat appropriate to the bracer, as described below, you may attune to that respective bracer without using an attunement slot. You may use one action to expend one charge from one of these bracers to conjure a single elemental as if you had just cast conjure minor elementals. If you do, you must maintain concentration as if you had just cast the spell. Alternatively, you can expend 3 charges to cast conjure elemental. You can also use an action to expend a charge and activate a single bracer for 1 hour. Each bracer has a specific benefit when activated, as described below:

Fire. This bracer grants you resistance to fire damage and grants you the ability to speak and understand ignan while it is activated.

Water. This bracer allows you to cast water breathing at will, gives you a swimming speed of 40 feet, gives you advantage on saving throws against water to move you against your will, and grants you the ability to speak and understand Aquan while it is activated.

Earth. This bracer gives you tremorsense out to a range of 60 feet, gives you advantage on saving throws against effects that issue from the ground itself, and grants you the ability to speak and understand Terran while it is activated.

Air. This bracer gives you a flying speed of 40 feet, allows you to cast gust of wind at will, and grants you the ability to speak and understand Auran while it is activated.

As long as you are attuned to all 4 bracers using attunement slots, two of them magically form to fit you as greaves, and you gain the following benefits when all four of them are activated:
	You gain the elemental adept abilities for each of the four elements. The earth bracer grants you acid elemental adept feat, the water bracer grants you cold elemental adept feat, the air bracer grants you lightning elemental adept feat, and the fire bracer grants you the fire elemental adept feat.
	If you already have the elemental adept feat from another source, you not only ignore resistances of that specific type, but immunities to that damage type as well. When elementals that you summon deal damage, they also ignore all damage resistances and immunities as well.
	Each bracer regains 1d6+1 charges daily at dawn.

    <text>While this may appear like a normal broom, it has an unsettling aura about it as if it has been touched by strange magics. The broom is weightless, and, when you speak the command word, it begins to float, unhindered, in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.
	Additionally, the broom has 3 charges and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. As an action, you may expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells from it using your spell save DC: detect evil and good, find familiar, mage armor, unseen servant.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This small iron clicker on a chain necklace has 10 charges, and says "feed me gold!" in common beside the trigger. You may expend a charge to cast find traps, also revealing the location of the traps-but the clicker shifts to form a small mouth afterwards, which will make chomping motions until you feed it the coin equivalent of 10 gp. The mouth disappears back into the clicker after it is fed the coins, which it chomps very loudly. When the last charge is spent, the clicker falls apart, creating a small pile of metal scraps.

Curse: This item is part of a set that was created from chain links off of a chain devil as part of a deal that was made with said devil. Each consecutive minute that goes by without feeding the clicker 10 gp has a consequence at the end of that time, as determined below.

	• End of the first minute: the "feed me gold!" script on the clicker becomes bold and the chomping motions speed up, causing a creature that touches the chomping mouth to take 1d4 piercing damage.

	• End of the second minute: the clicker begins to smoke and heat, causing 2d6 fire damage to any creature that touches it, and the script now glows an angry red.

	• End of the third minute: the clicker begins to growl "feed me gold!" in common and the script on the side changes to say "THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING!" in common. The clicker also begins to move unpredictably on it's own, bouncing along the ground, swinging the chain, etc. searching for the coins. It will attempt to bite and burn any creature it touches.

	• End of the fifth minute: the clicker booms "TOO LATE!", and magically summons the aforementioned chain devil.

    <text>When certain notes are played using this harp, they seem to affect humanoids in mysterious ways, filling them with new energy and strength. Once you begin a song on this harp, the instrument seems to carry on without your continued playing.
	This harp has 6 charges. All charges are regained after a Long Rest. You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the harp's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: bless (1 charge), calm emotions (2 charges), prayer of healing (2 charges), aura of vitality (3 charges), aura of purity (4 charges), aura of life (4 charges).
	While the harp is playing one of these songs, you can let go of it and it will float in the air at that spot. While playing this way, the harp has an AC of 15 and 10 hit points. If reduced to 0 hit points or grabbed by another creature, the harp stops playing.

    <name>Kinetic Ball</name>
    <detail>uncommon</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>When let loose, this rubbery sphere bounces nearly perfectly, ricocheting wildly without end. If you make an attack with the ball, your attack roll sets its later DCs. The Ball works as a thrown weapon with a range of 30/120, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to a single target. On a hit, it immediately bounces and you must make a Dexterity Saving Throw or be hit by the ball as well, for 2d6 damage. After that, or if the attack misses, the ball bounces erratically. The ball also bounces erratically if dropped, with a DC equal to 4d6, rather than the original attack roll.
	While bouncing, the ball ricochets in an area determined by its surroundings. Indoors, the ball rockets around the room where it was thrown, up to a radius of 60 feet. Outdoors, in the presence of barriers such as trees, rocks or buildings, it ricochets among them in a 60 foot radius sphere. Each round, on initiative count 20, all creatures in the area roll 1d10. Those who roll a 9 or 10 must make a Dexterity Saving Throw or be hit by the ball for 1d6 damage. The ball stops bouncing once a creature targeted by the ball uses their reaction to catch it by making a Strength (Athletics) check. After 3d6 rounds indoors, 3d4 rounds outdoors, or if the ball is released in an area without barriers, for example a large, open field, the ball simply flies 120 feet (or until it strikes an object) in a random direction from the original thrower and comes to a rest.

    <text>This carpet of flying is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, has a carrying capacity of 1,000 lbs and a flying speed of 100 ft, but requires a bonus action DC 12 Performance check with a musical instrument from at least one creature within 30 feet of it on every round in order to fly.
	Additional occupants may also use their bonus actions to make DC 15 performance checks. If at least half of all the occupants succeed, the carpet's flying speed increases to 250 feet for that round. If the carpet is ever carrying more than 2,000 los, it immediately falls limp, ceases to fly, and loses its magic for one hour or until the next dawn-whichever one comes last.

    <text>This rod has five forks stretching from its base to its head that curl to form a dome around a large opaque crystal bead. The forks come to a sharp point at the base of the rod. While holding this rod you can use an action to plant it and create a 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force that springs into existence around the rod. All creatures, objects, spells and other magical effects are barred and can't extend through the dome or be cast through it. The dome has 50 hit points, and resistance to all damage. If the rod is moved, the dome vanishes and cannot be used again for 1 minute. If the dome drops to 0 hit points, it vanishes and cannot be used again until the next dawn, otherwise the dome will regain 10 hit points every hour that it is inactive.

Arcane Focus: An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.

When the gem is in place, and its command word is spoken, the soul of the dead humanoid is called to return to occupy the body for as long as the gem remains-provided that the soul is available and willing. While the soul occupies the body, the humanoid regains its memories from life as well as its autonomy. The body does not repair, regrow, or otherwise return to its former status. Should you need a statblock for this humanoid, use the skeleton statblock.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This clockwork fox has the same stats as a pseudodragon, and it makes mechanical whirring noises when it flies. If you cast find familiar while the fox is within range, you can choose to attune to this fox and connect with it as your familiar instead of summoning a spirit, provided that you have an attunement slot available. If you ever end your attunement with the fox, you immediately lose your find familiar connection to it. If the fox drops to 0 hit points, it shuts down and does not reanimate until you end your attunement to it and re-attune, or until it receives magical healing. The fox cannot be dismissed into a pocket dimension, though you can use an action to end your attunement with it. Casting find familiar while you are attuned to this fox will end your attunement as well.
	The fox also has the following flaws: "When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it", "I'll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless", "I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me", "I'm never satisfied with what I have-I always want more", "There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest", "I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across", "I keep whatever I find" and "I am easily distracted".
