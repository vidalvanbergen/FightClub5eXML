Ammo: crossbow bolt

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
	This weapon has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn. As part of your Attack action, you can expend a charge to create and load a piece of radiant ammunition into the crossbow. This bolt deals an extra 1d6 damage on a hit and deals radiant damage, instead of its normal piercing damage.
	Additionally, as an action, you can expend 3 charges to load a blinding bolt of light into the crossbow and fire it at a point you can see within 60 feet, where it detonates in a flash. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. Motes of light hang in the air around that point for the next minute, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Reload: This weapon can be used to make a number of attacks before it must be reloaded. If you are proficient with the weapon, reloading it takes a bonus action; otherwise, reloading it takes an action. Some weapons require an action or longer to reload, even if you have proficiency, which is specified in the Reload property. If reloading a weapon requires longer than one action, the weapon can't be used to make attacks until reloading is finished.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Proficiency: martial, repeating crossbow

Ammo: crossbow bolt

This magic weapon has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 charges daily at dawn. As a bonus action, you can expend a charge to cause a thorny arrow to grow from the bow, choosing whether it is a Bramblestrike or Splinterstrike arrow. You can also spend three charges as an action to fire an Overgrowth Volley.

Bramblestrike: On a hit, this magic arrow deals the weapon's normal damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become restrained by magical vines for up to 1 minute. A restrained creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success.

Splinterstrike: On a hit, this magic arrow deals the weapon's normal damage, and then erupts in a storm of splinters and thorns. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 piercing damage.

Overgrowth Volley: Three thick-limbed, thorny arrows grow from the bow and fire at a point you choose that you can see within 120 feet of you. Where the arrows land, a mass of syklthorn brambles grow, creating an effect identical to the wall of thorns spell, dealing 4d8 damage instead of 7d8.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

When you miss an attack with this weapon, you can expend a charge to gain a +5 bonus to the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to hit. The weapon congratulates you when you hit an enemy, and condescendingly berates you when you miss.

Special: As an action, a bayonet can be mounted to any two-handed ranged weapon or removed from it. While mounted, you can use the bayonet to make a two-handed melee weapon attack, which deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Special: This weapon is used to immobilize creatures at a distance. When you hit a creature of Large size or smaller with this weapon, you can attempt to grapple the creature instead of dealing damage. When you do so, you use your attack roll for the grapple check, rather than making a Strength (Athletics) check. While grappling a creature with this weapon, you can't use the weapon on another target.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

When you miss an attack with this weapon, you can expend a charge to gain a +5 bonus to the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to hit. The weapon congratulates you when you hit an enemy, and condescendingly berates you when you miss.

Special: You can use an action to tie a rope to the end of a harpoon before it is thrown. If a ropetied harpoon hits a target, it becomes embedded in the target, and you can use an action on subsequent turns to hold fast to the rope and make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against the target to pull it up to 10 feet closer to you. Additionally, when the target moves, you can use your reaction to make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against it, preventing its movement on a success. If you use your action to do anything else, you lose your grip on the rope. If the target has hands, it can remove the harpoon as an action.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Proficiency: martial, repeating crossbow

    <text>While attuned to this magic weapon, you have proficiency in it. This weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you miss an attack with this weapon, you can expend a charge to gain a +5 bonus to the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to hit. The weapon congratulates you when you hit an enemy, and condescendingly berates you when you miss.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
