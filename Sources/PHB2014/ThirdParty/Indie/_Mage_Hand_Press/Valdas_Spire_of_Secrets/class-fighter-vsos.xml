        <text>Manipulates their skeleton to sprout weapons and armor of bone.

A bone knight, or an osteoth, is a warrior that has undergone an agonizing transmutation ritual, granting them the ability to fully control their bones. While this power is plainly disfiguring, it allows them to grow bone protrusions for weapons and armor, changing their skeleton's size and shape at will. Mastering this ability is a feat of endurance and creativity, resulting in a fighter whose most powerful weapon is not sheathed at their side, but sheathed within their flesh.
	Many fighters believe the osteoth ritual is a mere myth, a flight of fancy traded around campfires. And yet, the process is indeed real, preserved among moldering tomes and in the minds of deranged wizards. With some resourcefulness, the procedure can be replicated with the contents of any alchemist's lab, with a generous fatality rate of nearly half.

        <name>Adamant Ivory (Bone Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can sprout boney plates from your skin. While you aren't wearing armor, this natural armor provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
	Additionally, when you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to shield yourself from harm. Expend a Hit Die, roll it, and decrease the damage taken by the number rolled.

	Starting at 7th level, your blades are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Additionally, once per turn when you hit a creature with a bone weapon, you can expend a Hit Die to extend the bone into the target.

        <text>A bare-knuckle fighter that wrestles and delivers staggering punches.

Brawlers use their bare fists and raw force as their first and best weapons in combat. Such warriors come from tough stock-prize fighters, outlanders, bouncers, and veterans—and have learned to hone their bodies into implements of war. Wherever a brawler goes, bruised and broken bodies follow. It doesn't matter whether they're tossing thugs around a tavern or going toe-to-toe with a red dragon, brute force always comes out on top.

        <text>Leaps dozens of feet into the sky and comes crashing down, lance first.

Feared frontline warriors bearing lances and unique, streamlined armor, Celestial Lancers are famous for their Meteor Jump, a supernatural technique taught only to the rare few. The lancers trace their origins back to an order of dragon hunters who learned to leap above diving dragons and pin their wings with a swift, downward lance strike. This technique, combined with a suite of mystical powers drawn from the yawning sky, makes the lancers decisive warriors in the arena of vertical combat. Though Celestial Lancers may be hampered in claustrophobic dungeons, they excel underneath the open sky, where they can leap high and come crashing down for devastating impacts.

Principles from "always be the first one to hit the monster" to "never be the first one to touch a treasure chest" line a dungeoneer's journal.

        <name>Martial Archetype: Mage Hand Magus (HB)</name>
        <text>Manipulates a pair of mage hands to fight at range with levitating weapons.

Blades sweeping around in dramatic arcs, propelled by ghostly, disembodied hands— the Mage Hand Magi are truly a force to be reckoned with. While wizards are content to use mage hand to retrieve their wands and open doors from across the room, the cantrip's potential has always been clear for warriors: a deft mage hand can afford dozens of feet between a soldier and their foe, letting them deal a killing blow without raising a fingertip. Mage Hand Magi have mastered this cantrip through practice and discipline, elaborating a trick pioneered by warmages into a deadly fighting style of twin hovering blades. The most skilled can even manifest a warhand, a grand fist of magical wrath with which to crush their enemies.

        <name>Mage Hand Master (Mage Hand Magus (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, when you choose this archetype, you learn the mage hand cantrip if you did not know it before. You can cast it with the following improvements:

	• You can cast and control mage hand as a bonus action.

	• You summon two separate hands when you cast it, and you can control one or both of them when you use the spell.

	• The spell's duration is indefinite, ending only when you are knocked unconscious or you choose to end it.

	• Your mage hands are stronger than normal, capable of lifting a combined weight in pounds equal to 5 x your fighter level, and they are dexterous enough to perform any ability check you could normally perform with your hands.

        <name>Combat Hands (Mage Hand Magus (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you have learned to use your mage hands in combat. While you are holding nothing in your hands, your mage hands can wield weapons: each can wield a single one-handed weapon, or together they can wield a two-handed weapon.
	When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one or more of your attacks through your mage hands against targets you can see within their reach. You can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls. A mage hand not wielding a weapon can be used to punch a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 1d6 force damage on a hit.

While they aren't wielding weapons, you can use both of your hands together to grapple or shove a creature. When you do so, you add your Intelligence modifier to the Strength (Athletics) check.
	Additionally, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack with one of your hands when a creature leaves its reach.

        <text>Starting at 10th level, when you cast mage hand, you can form one of them into a much more powerful construct called a warhand. Your warhand is identical to the hand summoned by the spell arcane hand, except that you must use its abilities as an action instead of a bonus action. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell. When you use any of the warhand's abilities, you can use a bonus action to make a single attack with your other mage hand.
