    <text>This +1 magical bow is crafted from a living, vine-wrapped plant that continually sprouts small, seed-like arrowheads along its limbs. The bow does not require ammunition, producing its own biodegradable projectiles that wither shortly after impact.

Thornbuster: As an action, you can fire a seed-arrow at an unoccupied space you can see within the bow's range. At the start of your next turn, a small thornwood sapling erupts in that space and immediately explodes in a hail of razor-sharp thorns. Each creature within 10 feet of that space must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 piercing damage, or half as much on a successful one. The thornwood sapling then withers away.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    <text>You may add your dexterity modifier (Max 1) to your Armor Class. As a bonus action, you can grow roots from your armor, reducing your movement speed by half but giving you a climb speed equal to your normal movement speed. While touching a solid surface, you cannot be moved by effects that do not originate from you. While this effect is active, you cannot unwillingly drop your weapon. This effect can be ended by spending another bonus action.

    <text>This small potted tree weighs 10 pounds and has a rope harness making it easier to carry. The tree is covered with eight different flowers.
	Once a day as an Action, you can pluck a flower, causing the plant to bear fruit depending on which flower is pulled. The flowers that weren't chosen fall off. The fruit lasts until the next daw, after which they decay and the plant regrows all flowers. Once a fruit is chosen, another cannot be chosen until the dawn of the next day.

	• Waterberry - Sixteen small berries appear that can be popped to produce half a gallon of fresh water each.
	• Bolt Peppers - 5 peppers appear that can be used as crossbow bolts. They deal an additional 1d4 fire damage and are destroyed upon use.
	• Mealmelon - 3 melons grow that each contain a full day's worth of food for a single medium-sized creature.
	• Sour squash - The plant produces 8 small squashes that count as acid (PHB pg. 148)
	• Airstone Peach - Each of these 4 peaches contains a pit that when held in the mouth, prevents speed but provides breathable air for 1 hour.
	• Blackout Berry - The plant produces 3 berries with juice that can be coated on a weapon. When that weapon deals damage, the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1d4 rounds.
	• Glow Beans - Each of these 4 long bean pods can be broken, causing them to shed bright light for 20 ft. and dim light for 40 ft.
	• Potion Gourd - The plant grows 1d4 small gourds that count as Potions of Healing (FHB pg. 153)
