    <text>A plant grows in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The plant occupies that space and the flowers it grows contain sharp barbs that are expelled when prey gets too close.
	Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 20 feet of the Barb-Shooter must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. The creature takes 5 piercing damage on a failed save, or 2 piercing damage on a successful one. The plan wilts and vanishes when it has done a total of 40 damage.
