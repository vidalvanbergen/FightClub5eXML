    <text>Originally developed as a hangover cure by a suffering pirate, Drang's Morning After instantly cures the effects of poison on the target. The caster cracks an egg, which the target must consume raw, fueling the spell with small bits of abjuration magic that instantly soothes the stomach and head.

    <time>1 Action</time>
    <range>60 feet</range>
    <components>S, M (A silver coin)</components>
    <duration>1 minute</duration>
    <classes>Bard, Wizard, Warlock, Sorcerer</classes>
    <text>You conjure a small, invisible conduit between your hands and a point within range, allowing you to reach through space and pilfer from afar. The conduit is intangible, undetectable by normal means, and large enough for your hands to pass through. You can use your action on each of your turns to attempt to steal a small object such as a pouch, scroll, potion, or similar item, from a creature you can see within the spell's range. The conduit can be moved up to 30 feet as a bonus action.
	When you attempt to steal from a creature, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Intelligence (Arcana) check, contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you retrieve one unattended item the creature is visibly carrying (such as on their belt or in a satchel). On a failure, the attempt is noticed and the spell immediately ends.
	Items gripped or actively wielded cannot be taken using the spell.

Each creature within a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded and deafened until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also incapacitated for the same duration.
	A creature affected by this spell may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending all effects on itself on a success.
	This spell has no effect on creatures that are already blinded, defeaned, or both.
