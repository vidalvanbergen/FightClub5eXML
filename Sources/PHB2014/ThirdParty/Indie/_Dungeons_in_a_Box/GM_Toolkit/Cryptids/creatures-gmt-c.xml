    <description>Chupacabras are lean, lizard-like creatures with dark hairless bodies and sinister red eyes. They feast on the blood of other creatures which they draw out with their long tongues, leaving no trace of their presence, baffling farmers. Chupacabras live in small family units in underground tunnels running just below the surface of any environment.

    <description>A death worm is a long serpentine creature with hard plates along its back. A pair of barbed horns extend from either side of its massive jaws, and the creature moves through the earth as easily as a fish swims through water. They devour meat but their digestive system is slow, so they only need to surface once every month to feed.

    <description>Dropbears resemble small ursine creatures with round ears and coarse, unkept fur. Their powerful back legs allow them to pounce on nearby targets with surprising force and ferocity and disappear just as quickly. They are scavengers, however, often choosing to eat corpses rather than reveal their presence.

    <description>The mothman is often cloaked in darkness, its humanoid form hidden beneath layers of fine hair, which muffle its movements. A pair of large, hairy wings extends from its back, and its face is dominated by a set of enormous scarlet eyes. A mothman has a unique relationship with fate and destiny, and while they are generally solitary, one often appears before large natural disasters.

    <description>A sasquatch is a powerfully built, broad-shouldered humanoid figure covered in shaggy hair, with long, muscular arms, giving it an overall ape-like appearance. They live in isolated, small family groups in wild settings, as far from civilization as possible, and they often work with druidic circles to protect the beauty of nature.
