      <text>You have spent your lifetime collecting stories about legendary monsters and mysterious cryptids. These stories are often outlandish and unbelievable, but there's usually some grain of truth within them that you can use to help you in your travels. When you hear a story about a monster, you can discern some aspect of truth about it, as specific by your GM. This may be a definite characteristic of the monster, such as a Vulnerability, Resistance, or Skill Proficiency, or it can be related to its habits and habitat such as where it lives and how it hunts. In addition, when hearing about a monster or cryptid, you can consult your folklore repository to determine if you know anything about the subject in this same manner.
