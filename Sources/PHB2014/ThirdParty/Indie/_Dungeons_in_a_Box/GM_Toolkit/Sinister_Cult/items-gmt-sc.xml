    <text>Once per day, you may use this ornate red-enameled ladle to sit any liquid. When stirred for 1 minute, the liquid becomes magically enhanced. The next creature to drink from it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the attuned user for 1 hour. The effect ends early if the target is harmed.

    <name>Reliquary of Withered Tongues</name>
    <detail>very rare (requires attunement)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This grotesque amulet consists of withered tongues suspended in glistening amber and wired into a lattice of black brass. Whispered echoes of forgotten sermons reverberate faintly from its core.
	While attuned, you can cast Command and Suggestion once per day each without expanding a spell slot.
	When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a Charisma or Wisdom saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the roll. Once used, this feature can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
	If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a spell, the reliquary hisses a phrase in an unknown language.  You gain temporary hit points equal to twice your spellcasting ability modifier.
	Whenever a creature within 60 ft. of you succeeds on a saving throw against one of your enchantment or illusion spells, you can use your reaction to force them to make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 16). On a failure, they are silenced until the start of their next turn as their tongue feels withered and numb. This feature can be used once per long rest.

    <type>RG</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This black iron ring sears itself into the wearer's finger, leaving a visible brand that flickers with ghostly runes. Once attuned, it cannot be removed short of a Wish spell. 

You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC.

When you cast a spell that charms or frightens a creature, that creature takes 3d6 psychic damage if it fails its saving throw. 
	If a creature dies while charmed or frightened by you, you regain one expended spell slot of 5th level or lower. Once per long rest, you can cast Mass Suggestion without expending a spell slot. The spell requires no verbal components when cast this way.
	While attuned to the brand, your creature type counts as Fiend in addition to your own.
