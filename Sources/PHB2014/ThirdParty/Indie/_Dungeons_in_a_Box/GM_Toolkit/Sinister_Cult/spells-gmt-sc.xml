    <text>You hurl a mote of sickly energy that flickers like a dying candle. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or emit dim greenish light in a 5-foot radius until the end of its next turn. While glowing, it can't benefit from invisibility.

At higher levels: The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8) and 17th level (4d8).

    <text>You mark a creature with a flickering brand visible only to allies. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While cursed, the first attack made against the target each round has advantage.
	Additionally, any creature that hits the branded target regains 1 hit point per turn. This healing does not affect constructs or undead.

    <text>You draw a veil of whispered silence over the minds of your enemies. Choose one creature within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be muzzled by psychic interference. While muzzled:

	• The target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.
	• If the target attempts to speak, a shriek of gibbering voices erupts in its head, causing it to take 1d6 psychic damage.

The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

At higher levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

    <text>You speak a slow, rhythmic prayer. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature's speed is halved and it cannot take reactions. If the target attempts to cast a spell, it must first roll a Constitution saving throw or lose the spell. On a successful save, the target is immune to the effect for the duration of the spell.

    <text>Choose two creatures you can see within range. Ghostly chains lash out from a rift between them. Each target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be soul shackled for the duration. While shackled:

	• When one target takes damage, the other takes half as much damage.
	• If either target is reduced to 0 hit points, the other must make a Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
	• A creature may use its action to repeat the Charisma save, ending the effect on a success.
