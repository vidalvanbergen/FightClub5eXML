    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This brown oilskin seems in every respect to be a serviceable, if plain, cloak. When activated with a magic pass phrase set by the wearer, ten small pockets appear in the lining of the cloak. Each pocket can hold an item the size and weight of a book, and when the pass phrase is uttered again, the pockets become completely invisible to the naked eye as the contents of the pockets are shunted to an extra-dimensional space.

    <name>Globe of Misdirection</name>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This small crystal sphere, roughly the size of a marble, emits a faint white glow and contains swirling smoke within. A typical find includes 1d4+1 globes.
	As an action, you can crush a globe in your hand. For the next 24 hours, any divination spell that would reveal your location, such as locate creature, locate object or scrying, instead reveals the location where the globe was destroyed. Once crushed, the globe is consumed. The effect ends early if you die or if you willingly dismiss it as an action.

    <name>Helm of Eavesropping</name>
    <detail>uncommon (requires attunement)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This simple steel helm is etched with faint black runes that pulse subtly when activated. Originally favored by thieves and spies, it allows the wearer to perceive distant conversations without being seen.
	While wearing this helm, you can cast the clairvoyance spell once per day, requiring no material components. The spell uses your spell save DC, or a DC of 13 if you don't have one. The spell's sensor is always invisible, regardless of your class features.
	The helm regains this expended use daily at dawn.

    <name>Net of Entrapment</name>
    <detail>net, very rare (requires attunement)</detail>
    <type>R</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <weight>3</weight>
    <property>M,T</property>
    <range>5/15</range>
    <text>This finely crafted net is woven with strands of mithral and weighted with steel, making it unusually durable and easy to throw. While attuned to the net, you gain proficiency with nets if you don't already have it, and you gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon.
	A Large or smaller creature hit by the net is restrained until it is freed. The net has no effect on Huge or larger creatures or creatures without a physical form.
	A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within reach on a success. Dealing 10 slashing damage to the net (AC15) also frees the restrained creature, ending the effect and destroying the net.
	While wielding this net, if you take the Attack action with it, you can make only one attack with it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
	If the net is damaged but not destroyed, it regains 1d4+2 hit points each day at dawn. When it has at least 10 hit points, it is considered functional again.

Proficiencies: martial, net
