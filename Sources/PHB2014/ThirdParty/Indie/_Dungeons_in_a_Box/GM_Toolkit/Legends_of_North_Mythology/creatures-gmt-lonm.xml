    <description>Smarter than their common brethren, mountain trolls have a semblance of society, and some are even willing to trade, especially for goods found above ground - as they turn to stone if they enter sunlight. In exchange, they are willing to part with the strange potions they create. These creatures are known to wear simple clothing and have an intense hatred for the divine.

	• What Was. If a spell is used by a norm, and the target succeeds on their saving throw and is unaffected, the norn recovers the lost spell slot.

	• What is. The norns are immune to critical hits. Additionally attacks rolls made with their shears critically hit on a 19-20.

    <description>Few know the whims of a norn. These creatures who bend fate to their will are just as likely to aid someone as fight them. Prophecies are the only things norns cherish. They often take the form of women at various ages. Those lucky, or unlucky, enough to see them state there is an otherworldliness to the way they look and act that is hard to describe.

    <description>The World Serpent is a gargantuan, ancient monstrosity said to encircle the edges of the mortal world, its breath poisoning the sea and its coils shaking the earth. It speaks no language, yet its presence alone heralds omens, madness and the slow unravelling of order. Worshipped, feared or hunted by the gods, the World Serpent is all inevitability given ultimate form.
