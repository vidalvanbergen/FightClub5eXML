    <text>A wave of snow and ice shoots forth in a 30 ft. cone. All creatures within the cone must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 3d6 cold damage plus 3d6 bludgeoning damage and are pushed 20 ft. away and knocked prone. On a successful save, creatures take half the damage and are otherwise unaffected.

At higher levels: When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, the length of the cone increases by 5 ft. and the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

    <components>S, M (A sprig of mistletoe)</components>
    <duration>Instantaneous</duration>
    <classes>Warlock</classes>
    <text>A single dart of mistletoe shoots out like an arrow toward a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 6d4 piercing damage. This damage ignores resistances and immunities. If the target has resistance to piercing damage, increase the damage dice to d6s. If it has immunity to piercing damage, increase the damage dice to d8s. If the target is a celestial, fiend, fey, monstrosity, or undead, any successful attacks with this spell are considered critical hits.

At higher levels: When you cast this spell as a 4th level or higher, increase the damage dealt by 2d4 for each spell slot above 3rd.
