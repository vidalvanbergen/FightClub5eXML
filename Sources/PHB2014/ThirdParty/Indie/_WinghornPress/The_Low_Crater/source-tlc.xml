  <description>Will You Venture Into the Low Crater?
When the party stumbles across a ragged, battle-scarred band of knights they are amazed to hear that the hardy veterans were soundly beaten by mere kobolds.

The crafty little fiends have set up in the rubble of a fallen Earthmote thought to be home to a long-dead dragon and - more importantly - its horde. When the Sable Spears charged in to drive them out, however, they were confronted with ambushes, traps and a whole lot of pain.

Dare you venture where the Sable Spears failed, and explore the Low Crater in search of treasure, glory and adventure? Or will you join the sheepish ranks of adventurers turned aside by the prospect of tangling with Kobolds?

An Adventure for 6th+ Level Parties.

Take your party through an adventure that will teach them that CR isn't everything, and that even the weakest foe can prove dangerous when they're cornered (though having the power to animate long-dead dragon bones helps too, of course).</description>
