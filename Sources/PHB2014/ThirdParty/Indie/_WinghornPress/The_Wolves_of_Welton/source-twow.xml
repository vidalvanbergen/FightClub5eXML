  <description>Come and wolf down the adventure!
It's been a long time since the people of Welton have worried about anything but sheep ticks and late frosts, but now a pack of strangely determined wolves are spiriting away entire flocks at a time and driving farmers from their fields.

With food running low and their sorcerer-in-residence nowhere to be found, the village council send out a desperate plea for brave adventurers to destroy the beasts. Is the job as easy as a walk in the woods, or is there more to the Wolves of Welton than mere animal cunning? There's only one way to find out...

A Single-Session Adventure For Parties of 2nd-3rd level
A fresh take on the ancient 'kill ten wolves' quest that RPG fans will be so familiar with, The Wolves of Welton is designed to be played from start to finish in just one 3-6 hour session with limited preparation from the DM.</description>
