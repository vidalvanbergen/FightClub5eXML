  <description>Do your players have the wool to survive?
Adventure, danger and a decent dose of downright weirdness erupt when the party's attempt to grab a rare afternoon of downtime is interrupted by a frantic sheep equipped with a Scroll of Speak to Animals. Soon they are dragged into a magical grudge match that will test their strength, courage and willingness to endure extremely baa'd puns.

Will our heroes be able to overcome a band of transmuted assassins on the hunt for a mutton dinner and fend off an extremely bitter ex-apprentice packing a dangerously unstable magic item?

There's only one way to find out…

A free single-session adventure
The Wild Sheep Chase is designed to be played from start to finish in just one 3-6 hour session with limited preparation from the DM.

All major characters have roleplaying notes included and the document comes complete with a full-size environment.</description>
