        <text>Barbarians who walk the Path of Booming Magnificence strive to be as lions among their people: symbols of vitality, majesty, and courage. They serve at the vanguard, leading their allies at each charge and drawing their opponents' attention away from more vulnerable members of their group. As they grow more experienced, members of this path often take on roles as leaders or in other integral positions.

The barbarians who follow this path often do so after surviving a dragon encounter or are raised in a culture that worships them. Dragons tend to have a mixed view of the barbarians who choose this path. Some dragons, in particular the metallic dragons, view such a transformation as a flattering act of admiration. Others may recognize or even fully embrace them as useful to their own ambitions. Still others view this path as embarrassing at best and insulting at worst, for what puny, two-legged creature can ever hope to come close to the natural ferocity of a dragon! When choosing this path, consider what experiences drove you to such a course. These experiences will help inform how you deal with the judgment of dragons you encounter in the world.

        <text>At 14th level, if you are raging and a creature you can see within your reach hits another creature with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the attack and use the lower of the two rolls. If the result is still a hit, reduce the damage dealt by your weapon damage die + your Strength modifier.

        <name>Primal Path: Path of Thorns (HB)</name>
        <text>Path of Thorns barbarians use ancient techniques developed by the druids of old that enable them to grow thorns all over their body. The first barbarians of this path fought alongside these druids to defend the natural order. In the centuries since, the knowledge of these techniques has spread, allowing others access to this power.
	Though named for the thorns that covered the first barbarians to walk this path, current followers of this path can display thorns, spines, or boney growths while raging.

        <name>Blossoming Thorns (Path of Thorns (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, when you enter your rage, hard, sharp thorns emerge over your whole body, turning your unarmed strikes into dangerous weapons. When you hit with an unarmed strike while raging, your unarmed strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, while raging, when you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
	The unarmed strike damage you deal while raging increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 8th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.

        <name>Thorned Grasp (Path of Thorns (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature while raging, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds, and it takes 1d4 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns, provided you continue to grapple the creature and are raging. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4.

        <name>Nature's Blessing (Path of Thorns (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, the thorns you grow while raging become more powerful and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you are hit by a melee weapon attack by a creature within 5 feet of you while raging, that creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4.
	Alternatively, while raging, you can use your reaction to disarm a creature that hits you with a melee weapon while within 5 feet of you by catching its weapon in your thorns instead of the attacker taking damage from your thorns. The attacker must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or drop the weapon it used to attack you. The weapon lands at its feet. The attacker must be wielding a weapon for you to use this reaction.

        <name>Toxic Infusion (Path of Thorns (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 10th level, when you enter your rage or as a bonus action while raging, you can infuse your thorns with toxins for 1 minute. While your thorns are infused with toxins, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with an unarmed strike must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
