      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Justice (HB)</name>
        <text>The Oath of Justice is a commitment not to the tenets of good or evil but a holy vow sworn to uphold the laws of a nation, a city, or even a tiny village. When lawlessness threatens the peace, those who swear to uphold the Oath of Justice intervene to maintain order, for if order falls to lawlessness, it is only a matter of time before all of civilization collapses into anarchy.
	While many young paladins take this oath to protect their country and the people close to them from criminals, some older adherents to this oath know that what is just is not necessarily what is right.

Tenets of Justice:
All paladins of justice uphold the law in some capacity, but their oath differs depending on their station. A paladin who serves a queen upholds slightly different tenets than one who serves a small town.

Uphold the Law. The law represents the triumph of civilization over the untamed wilds. It must be preserved at all costs.

Punishment Fits the Crime. The severity of justice acts in equal measure to the severity of a wrongdoer's transgressions.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Justice Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

Oath of Justice Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | color spray, guiding bolt
5th | locate object, zone of truth
9th | lightning bolt, slow
13th | faithful hound, locate creature
17th | arcane hand, hold monster

        <text>You can use your Channel Divinity to bind your target to you. As an action, you extend a line of energy toward a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is tethered and can't move more than 30 feet away from you for 1 minute. While tethered, the target takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of I) at the end of each of its turns. You can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by the tethered creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the creature's choice). On a success, you can pull the creature up to 15 feet in a straight line toward you. As an action, the tethered creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it breaks the tether.

If you end your movement within 5 feet of the attacker, you can make one melee attack against it as part of this reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the target of the attack, you can become the target of the attack instead as part of this reaction.

    <!-- Sacred Oath: Oath of Safeguarding (HB) -->
    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Safeguarding (HB)</name>
        <text>Paladins who choose the Oath of Safeguarding spend their lives in service to others, conserving the people and places they vow to protect. They take missions to guard against assassination attempts, safely transport a person or group through treacherous lands, and stand as bastions for locations under attack. These paladins are no mere mercenaries, however, as they view their missions as sacred vows.

Tenets of Safeguarding:
Paladins undertaking the Oath of Safeguarding take their responsibilities seriously and are most likely to seek atonement should they fail in their duties. However, they have no qualms about terminating their protection when their charges prove nefarious. In these cases, they won't leave people stranded in a hostile environment or situation, but they also focus their efforts on their allies over unworthy, former charges. Even when these paladins serve no charge, they seek opportunities to shield others from harm. In combat, they rush to aid their allies and stand alone to allow others to flee from battle.

Last Line of Defense. When your allies must retreat or regroup, you remain to ensure they have ample time to withdraw before withdrawing yourself. If your mission requires you to guard a building, you are the final obstacle the attackers face before breaching the building.

Protect the Charge. You pledge to preserve the lives of people you protect and the sanctity of all structures you guard, even if it means endangering yourself. When you must rest, you ensure your charge is as safe as possible, turning to trusted allies to aid you.

Shield All Innocents. In the absence of a sacred charge to protect, you endeavor to keep all those who can't defend themselves safe from harm. In cases where your charge must take priority, you do what you can to defend the helpless.

Uphold the Vow. You acknowledge the person you protect may reveal themselves as unworthy, such as by committing nefarious acts or exploiting your protection and fidelity, or the location you guard may become a site of terrible acts. When you witness this, you are free to terminate your guardianship. However, you don't leave your now-former charge in any present danger, if only for the possibility of future atonement.

Unwavering. Nothing shall distract you from your mission. If you are magically compelled to desert your post, you do your utmost to resume your duty. Failing that, you take out your vengeance on the party responsible for your dereliction.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Safeguarding Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | longstrider, shield of faith

Tenets of the Elements:
Though exact interpretations and words of the Oath of the Elements vary between those who serve the subtle, elemental spirits of the world and those who serve elemental deities or genies, paladins of this oath share these tenets.

Defend the Natural World. Every mountaintop, valley, cave, stream, and spring is sacred. You would fight to your last breath to protect natural places from harm.

Lead the Line. You stand at the forefront of every battle as a beacon of hope to lead your allies to victory.

Act Wisely, Act Decisively. You weigh your actions carefully and offer counsel to those who would behave impulsively. When the time is right, you unleash the fury of the elements upon your enemies.

Integrity. Your word is your bond. You don't lie or deceive others and always treat them with fairness.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Hearth (HB)</name>
        <text>Paladins who swear the Oath of the Hearth endeavor to extend the comforts of home to others, by allaying the rigors of travel or simply assuring those who grow despondent of the possibility of returning home.

Ironically, paladins who follow this oath remain far from home in pursuit of their goals. Their oath reflects the welcoming warmth and light provided by the hearth, and paladins following the oath use these elements to turn away the cold or defeat enemies who employ cold as weapons.

Tenets of the Hearth:
Paladins who take the Oath of the Hearth accommodate all creatures and attempt to find diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Once engaged in battle, though, these paladins fight until they defeat their enemies, or their enemies surrender. They rarely extend this peaceful stance to creatures who attack with cold or desire to spread cold conditions beyond natural confines.

Bastion of Peace. Reach out the hand of friendship when encountering strangers, and advocate for peace at the outset of any meeting. Encourage your companions to do likewise. When it becomes clear your opponents wish for violence, don't shrink away from combat.

Beacon in the Dark. When winter comes and the nights increasingly lengthen, shine a welcoming light to which all people can rally. No creature shall prey on others under the cover of darkness while you are there.

Hospitality of Home. Provide the comforts of home to those who meet with you peacefully. Respect others' cultures and traditions, provided they don't espouse aggression and violence toward others.

Protection from the Elements. Ensure all people have shelter from the weather. Help during spring flooding, wintry blizzards, and when the blistering sun threatens heatstroke in the summer.

Repel the Cold. Strive against foes that seek to bring eternal winter to the world or expand their icy domains into warmer climates. Understand the necessity of the changing of seasons and seek to banish only cold that is abnormal.

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Hearth Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

        <text>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak soothing words. For 1 minute, each creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to attack another creature. A creature hostile to you has disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect ends on a creature if it is attacked or harmed by a spell.

        <text>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak a prayer against unnatural cold. Each cold creature within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
	A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

        <text>Beginning at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal cold damage. If such a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or effect that allows the creature to take only half the cold damage on a successful save, the creature instead takes no damage. In addition, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against the longterm effects of exposure to cold weather. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

In addition, you can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.

        <text>At 20th level, you can take on the aspects of a healthy, tended fire, radiating heat and light. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

	• You shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

	• Whenever a cold creature starts its turn within 20 feet of you, the creature takes 2d8 fire damage, which ignores resistance and immunity to fire damage.

	• Whenever you cast a paladin spell that deals fire damage and has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it as a bonus action instead.

	• Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. If you deal fire damage to a cold creature, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute, or until it takes any damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Plaguetouched (HB)</name>
        <text>After suffering an attack by a darakhul, you were infected with the dreaded—and generally fatal—darakhul fever. As you felt your life draining away and the grasp of eternal undeath clenching its cold fingers around your heart, you called out to any power that would answer your prayers. You pledged that you would do anything asked of you, if only you would be spared this fate worse than death.
	That prayer was answered. The source of that answered prayer is not known, but its power flowed through you, helping you drive off the horrible unlife that was your fate. That power flows through you still. It drives you to defend innocents from the scourge of undeath, and it provides special powers for you to use in that fight.

Restriction: Non-Darakhul
You can choose this paladin sacred oath only if you are not a darakhul.

Tenets of the Plaguetouched:
Paladins following the Oath of the Plaguetouched share these tenets.

Bravery. In the face of terrible creatures, you stand like a wall between them and the innocent people whom those creatures would devour or transform.

Stop the Spread of Undeath. Fight to ensure the undead don't snuff out the light of life in the world.

Relentless. Creatures of undeath never tire; you must remain vigilant.

Mercy. Those who suffer disease must be cared for. If you could survive certain death, so can they. But when it is clear they are about to transform into a monster, you must end their suffering quickly.

Oath Spells:
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Plaguetouched Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

Oath of the Plaguetouched Spells:
Paladin Level | Spells
3rd | bane, protection from evil and good
5th | enhance ability, lesser restoration
9th | life from death*, remove curse
13th | blight, freedom of movement
17th | greater restoration, bold monster

        <text>As a bonus action, you summon forth your power into a shining aura around yourself. For 1 minute, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, each hostile creature within 5 feet of you has disadvantage on its first attack roll each turn that isn't against you. If the hostile creature is undead, it instead has disadvantage on all attack rolls that aren't against you. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
