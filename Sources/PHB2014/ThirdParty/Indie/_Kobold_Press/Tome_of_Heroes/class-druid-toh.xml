        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of Ash (HB)</name>
        <text>Druids of the Circle of Ash believe in the power of rebirth and resurrection, both physical and spiritual. The ash they take as their namesake is the result of burning and death, but it can fertilize the soil and help bring forth new life. For these druids, ash is the ultimate symbol of the elegant cycle of life and death that is the foundation of the natural world. Some such druids even use fresh ash to clean themselves, and the residue is often kept visible on their faces.
	Druids of this circle often use the phoenix as their symbol, an elemental creature that dies and is reborn from its own ashes. These druids aspire to the same purity and believe resurrection is possible if they are faithful to their beliefs. Others of this circle are drawn to volcanos and find volcanic eruptions and their resulting ash clouds to be auspicious events.
	All Circle of Ash druids request to be cremated after death, and their ashes are often given over to others of their order. What later happens with these ashes, none outside the circle know.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Ash Cloud (Circle of Ash (HB))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape and, rather than assuming a beast form, create a small, brief volcanic eruption beneath the ground, causing it to spew out an ash cloud. As an action, choose a point within 30 feet of you that you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	This eruption creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of ash centered on the eruption point. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws until the start of its next turn. Creatures that don't need to breathe or that are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.
	You automatically succeed on this saving throw while within the area of your ash cloud, but you don't automatically succeed if you are in another Circle of Ash druid's ash cloud.
	The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

        <text>Starting at 2nd level, your vision can't be obscured by ash, fire, smoke, fog, or the cloud created by your Ash Cloud feature, but it can still be obscured by other effects, such as dim light, dense foliage, or rain. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against gas or cloud-based effects, such as from the cloudkill or stinking cloud spells, a gorgon's petrifying breath, or a kraken's ink cloud.

        <text>At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see (including yourself) takes damage, you can use your reaction to cover the creature in magical ash, giving it temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target gains the temporary hit points before it takes the damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
	In addition, while your Ash Cloud feature is active and you are within 30 feet of it, you can use a bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the cloud. You can use this teleportation no more than once per minute.

        <text>At 10th level, your Ash Cloud feature becomes more potent. Instead of the normal eruption effect, when you first create the ash cloud, each creature within 10 feet of the point you chose must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	In addition, when a creature enters this more potent ash cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws while it remains within the cloud. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe, but creatures that are immune to poison are immune to this effect.
	If at least one creature takes damage from the ash cloud's eruption, you can use your reaction to siphon that destructive energy into the rapid growth of vegetation. The area within the cloud becomes difficult terrain that lasts while the cloud remains. You can't cause this growth in an area that can't accommodate natural plant growth, such as the deck of a ship or inside a building.
	The ash cloud now lasts for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the explosion, your body becomes a pile of ashes.
	At the end of your next turn, you reform from the ashes with all of your equipment and half your maximum hit points. You can choose whether or not you reform prone. If your ashes are moved before you reform, you reform in the space that contains the largest pile of your ashes or in the nearest unoccupied space. After you reform, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

        <text>Druids of the Circle of Bees are friends to all stinging insects but focus their attention on honeybees and other pollinating insects. When not adventuring, they tend hives, either created by the insects or by themselves. They tap into the horror inherent in stinging insects to protect their allies or the fields hosting their bee friends.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Circle Spells (Circle of Bees (HB))</name>
        <text>Your bond with bees and other stinging beasts grants you knowledge of certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the true strike cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of Bees Spells table.
	Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Circle of Bees Spells:

2nd | true strike
3rd | blur, bombardment of stings*
5th | fly, haste
7th | giant insect, locate creature

	When a beast other than a bee attacks you with a weapon that deals poison damage, such as a giant spider's bite or a scorpion's sting, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on its attack rolls against you until the start of its next turn.

        <name>Bee Stinger (Circle of Bees (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 2nd level, you can use an action and expend one use of your Wild Shape to grow a bee's stinger, typically growing from your wrist, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with an unarmed strike while this stinger is active, you use Wisdom instead of Strength for the attack, and your unarmed strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier + poison damage equal to half your proficiency bonus, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
	The stinger lasts for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down) or until you use your Wild Shape again.
	When you reach 6th level in this class, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and the poison damage dealt by your stinger equals your proficiency bonus. In addition, the unarmed strike damage you deal while the stringer is active increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

While you are covered in a mantle of bees, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee weapon, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker takes 1d8 piercing damage and 1d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the attacker takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.
	While the mantle is active, you can use an action to direct the bees to swarm a 10-foot-radius sphere within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 piercing damage and 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. The bees then disperse, and your mantle ends.

        <text>Circle of Crystals druids first arose in subterranean environments, where they helped tend giant crystal gardens, but now they can be found most anywhere with access to underground caverns or geothermal activity. These druids view crystals as a naturally occurring form of order and perfection, and they value the crystals slow growth cycle, as it reminds them the natural world moves gradually but eternally. This teaches young druids patience and assures elder druids their legacy will be carried on in each spire of crystal. As druids of this circle tend their crystals, they learn how to use the harmonic frequencies of different crystals to create a variety of effects, including storing magic.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Resonant Crystal (Circle of Crystals (HB))</name>
        <text>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn to create a special crystal that can take on different harmonic frequencies and properties. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. As a bonus action, you can cause the crystal to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the light as a bonus action.
	Whenever you finish a long rest, you can attune your crystal to one of the following harmonic frequencies. The crystal can have only one harmonic frequency at a time, and you gain the listed benefit while you are wearing or carrying the crystal. The crystal retains the chosen frequency until you finish a long rest.

	• Clarity. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

	• Cleansing. You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.

	• Focus. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain concentration on a spell when you take damage.

	• Healing. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

	• Vitality. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using the resonant crystal as your focus, one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you gains temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

To create or replace a lost resonant crystal, you must perform a 1-hour ceremony. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous crystal, if one existed. If a previous crystal had a harmonic frequency, the new crystal has that frequency, unless you create the new crystal during a long rest.

You can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature and transform yourself into a form made of animated sand rather than transforming into a beast form. While in your sand form, you retain your game statistics. Because your body is mostly sand, you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to escape a grapple or the restrained condition.
	You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the equipment to move with you if you flow through particularly narrow spaces.
	You can stay in your sand form for 10 minutes, or until you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again. While in your sand form, you can use a bonus action to do one of the following:

	• Abrasive Blast. You launch a blast of abrasive sand at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the creature takes slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

	• Stinging Cloud. You emit a cloud of fine sand at a creature you can see within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

When you reach 10th level in this class, you can stay in your sand form for 1 hour or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. In addition, the damage of Abrasive Blast increases to 2d8, and the range of Stinging Cloud increases to 10 feet.

On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 slashing damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dervish. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
	As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the sand dervish up to 30 feet in any direction. If you ram the dervish into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the dervish's damage, and the dervish stops moving this turn. When you move the dervish, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and float it across pits up to 10 feet wide.
	The sand dervish lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
	When you reach 10th level in this class, the damage dealt by the dervish increases to 2d8.

	• Sand Sphere. You can use an action to conjure a 20-foot radius sphere of thick, swirling sand at a point you can see within 90 feet. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature moving through the area must spend 3 feet of movement for every I foot it moves. The sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required).

	• Whirlwind. You can use an action to transform into a whirlwind of sand until the start of your next turn. While in this form, your movement speed is doubled, and your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While in whirlwind form, you have resistance to all damage, and you can't be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned, but you also can't cast spells, can't make attacks, and can't manipulate objects that require fine dexterity.

Once you use one of these options, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

	When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d8 slashing damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

By continued communion with plant life, they believe they draw nearer to what they call "The Green," a cosmic thread that binds all plant life.

        <name>Summon Green Spirit (Circle of the Green (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can summon a spirit of the Green, a manifestation of primordial plant life. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon the Green spirit rather than assuming a beast form.
	The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. When the spirit appears, the area in a 10-foot radius around it becomes tangled with vines and other plant growth, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
	The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Green Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.
	You determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches and leaves, while others look like creatures with leafy bodies and heads made of gourds or fruit. Some even resemble beasts, only made entirely of plant material.
	In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The green spirit can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
	The spirit remains for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die. When it manifests, the spirit bears 10 fruit that are infused with magic. Each fruit works like a berry created by the goodberry spell.

You can't cast a spell this way again until the next time you summon your green spirit.
	Whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points while your green spirit is summoned, roll a d8 and add the result to the total hit points restored.
	In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your green spirit.

	• You gain temporary hit points equal to your green spirit's current hit points.

	• You gain a climbing speed of 30 feet.

	• You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.

	• The ground within 10 feet of you is difficult terrain for creatures hostile to you.

	• You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to make a tendril attack against one creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

This feature lasts until the temporary hit points you gained from this feature are reduced to 0, until the spirit's duration ends, or until you use an action to separate. If you separate, the green spirit has as many hit points as you had temporary hit points remaining. If this effect ends because your temporary hit points are reduced to o, the green spirit disappears until you summon it again.
