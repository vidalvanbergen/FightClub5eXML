        <name>Roguish Archetype: Cat Burglar (HB)</name>
        <text>As a cat burglar, you've honed your ability to enter closed or restricted areas, drawing upon a tradition first developed among the catfolk, who often are innately curious and driven to learn what wonders, riches, or unusual friends and foes lie beyond their reach or just out of sight. In ages past, some allowed this inquisitiveness to guide them toward a rogue's life devoted to bridging that gap by breaking into any and all structures, dungeons, or walled-off regions that prevented them from satisfying their curiosity.
	So successful were these first catfolk burglars that other rogues soon began emulating their techniques. Walls become but minor inconveniences once you work out the best methods of scaling them and learn to mitigate injuries from falls. In time, cat burglars become adept at breaching any openings they find;
after all, if a door was not meant to be opened, why would it have been placed there? Those who devote a lifetime to such endeavors eventually learn to spot and bypass even the cleverest traps and hidden doors, including those disguised or warded by magic.
	Some cat burglars use their abilities to help themselves to the contents of treasure vaults or uncover hidden secrets, others become an integral part of an adventuring party that values skillful infiltration techniques, and still others get the jump on their foes by taking the fight to them where and when they least expect it, up to and including private bed chambers or inner sanctums. You'll likely end up someplace you're not supposed to be, but those are the places most worth visiting!

        <text>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. If you already have a climbing speed equal to or greater than your walking speed, it increases by 5 feet. In addition, when you are falling, you can use your reaction to soften the fall. You reduce the falling damage you take by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus + your rogue level. You don't land prone, unless the damage you take from the fall would reduce you to less than half your hit point maximum.

You can choose for this damage to be audible out to a range of 100 feet or to be audible only within 5 feet of the point where you hit the object or structure. Similarly, you can choose for this damage to appear more or less impactful than it actually is, such as neatly carving a hole for you to squeeze through a wall or window or bursting a door off its hinges.
	Your expertise at deftly dismantling crafted works extends to constructs and undead. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack feature against constructs and undead. As normal, you can't use Sneak Attack if you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Dawn blades are devout rogues, drawing divine power from deities of light to strike as a sudden ray of searing sunlight in the darkness.

        <text>When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in alchemist's supplies, carpenter's tools, mason's tools, and tinker's tools. Using these tools, you can do or create the following.

Alchemical Bomb. As an action, you can mix together volatile chemicals into an explosive compound and throw it at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking 1d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Alchemical bombs lose their potency and become inert 1 minute after they are created.
	If a construct fails the saving throw or if you throw the bomb at a structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried, your bomb also deals your Sneak Attack damage to the target.
	When you reach certain levels in this class, the bomb's damage increases: at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

Jury Rig Fortification. You are adept at creating fortifications with whatever materials are at hand.

With 1 minute of work, you can create one of the following. Your ability to use this option might be limited by the available building materials or if the ground is too hard to work, at the GM's discretion.
	• Create a low wall that is large enough to provide half cover to a Medium creature.
	• Dig a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide trench to a depth of 3 feet.
	• Build a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide ladder. Each additional minute spent on this option increases the length of the ladder by 5 feet. The ladder is sturdy enough to be used as a bridge.

Hastily Trap an Area. You can create and set some types of traps quickly. The Creating Traps table indicates the timeframes required to build and deploy commonly used traps. At the GM's discretion, you can use this feature to make and use other types of traps.

Cantrips:
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn another cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Soulspy Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend one of these slots at the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell inflict wounds and have a 1st-level and a and-level spell slot available, you can cast inflict wounds using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and necromancy spells on the cleric spell list. The Spells Known column of the Soulspy Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or necromancy spell and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can be from any school of magic.
	When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cleric spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cleric spell list.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You learn your spells through meditation and prayer to the powerful forces that guide your actions. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

        <name>Divine Symbol (Soulspy (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to create a symbol of your deity that hovers within 5 feet of you. The symbol is a Tiny object that is visible but invulnerable and intangible, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you dismiss it (no action required). While this symbol is active, you gain the following benefits:

	• Your Divine Symbol functions as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

	• As a bonus action, you can turn the symbol into thieves' tools, which you can use to pick locks, disarm traps, or any other activities that would normally require such tools. While your Divine Symbol is functioning in this way, it loses all other properties listed here. You can change it from thieves' tools back to its symbol form as a bonus action.

	• The symbol sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action. When you extinguish the symbol's light, you can also snuff out one candle, torch, or other nonmagical light source within 10 feet of you.

	• When you create this symbol, and as an action on each of your turns while the symbol is active, you can force the symbol to shoot divine energy at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you reach certain levels in this class, the symbol's damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>When you reach 13th level, you can use your Divine Symbol to deliver your cleric spells that have a range of touch. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you as the target of the spell. You can't use your Sacred Stealth feature on a spell delivered in this way. After you cast the spell, your Divine Symbol ends.
	In addition, when you cast a spell that deals radiant or necrotic damage, you can switch it to do the other type of damage instead.

        <text>At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically channel life force energy out of one creature and into another. When you deal radiant or necrotic damage with your Divine Symbol attack or a cleric spell or cantrip, choose a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to half the radiant or necrotic damage dealt. You can target yourself with this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

        <name>Roguish Archetype: Underfoot (HB)</name>
        <text>Though most rogues prefer ambushing their opponents from the shadows, erina rogues ambush their opponents from below. These Underfoot use druidic magic and their natural aptitude for burrowing to defend their forest homes. The Underfoot are an elite order of burrow warriors in every erina colony. Using a combination of guerilla attacks and druidic magic, they are a force to be reckoned with, diving into fights nose-forward.

Restriction: Erina
You can choose this roguish archetype only if you are an erina.

        <name>Spellcasting (Underfoot (HB))</name>
        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells drawn from the magic of the wilds.

Cantrips:
You learn three cantrips: shillelagh and two other cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn another druid cantrip of your choice at loth level.

Spell Slots:
The Underfoot Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend one of these slots at the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell longstrider and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast longstrider using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the divination and transmutation spells on the druid spell list. The Spells Known column of the Underfoot Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a divination or transmutation spell of your choice and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can be from any school of magic.
	When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the druid spells you know and replace it with another spell from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a divination or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. Your magic draws upon your connection with the natural world. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

	• Its duration increases to 1 hour.

	• The spell ends early only if another creature holds the weapon or if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more.
