      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Wyrmling Blessing (Acient Dragons (HB))</name>
        <text>Also starting at 1st level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons bestows a blessing upon you. When you finish a long rest, you choose which blessing to accept. You can have only one blessing at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a long rest.

Aquatic Affinity. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. In addition, you can communicate with beasts that can breathe water as if you had cast the speak with animals spell.

Draconic Hunger. When you are below half your hit point maximum and you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. This feature can restore you to no more than half of your hit point maximum.

Draconic Sight. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this blessing increases its range by 30 feet. In addition, you can use an action to create an invisible sensor within 30 feet of you in a location you can see or in an obvious location within range, such as behind a door or around a corner, for 1 minute. The sensor is an extension of your own senses, allowing you to see and hear through it as if you were in its place, but you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses while using this sensor. As a bonus action, you can move the sensor anywhere within 30 feet of you. The sensor can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, and if it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can use an action to end the sensor early.
	A creature that can see the sensor, such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight, sees a luminous, intangible dragon's eye about the size of your fist.

Elemental Versatility. Choose one of the following when you accept this blessing: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You can't change the type until you finish a long rest and choose this blessing again. When you deal damage with a spell, you can choose for the spell's damage to be of the chosen type instead of its normal damage type.

        <name>Draconic Mien (Acient Dragons (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you begin to take on draconic aspects. When you finish a long rest, choose one of the following types of damage: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You have resistance to the chosen damage type. This resistance lasts until you finish a long rest.
	In addition, as an action, you can harness a portion of your patrons' mighty presence, causing a spectral version of your dragon patron's visage to appear over your head. Choose up to three creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed or frightened (your choice) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a short or a long rest.

        <name>Ascended Blessing (Acient Dragons (HB))</name>
        <text>At 10th level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons grows stronger, granting you more powerful blessings. When you finish a long rest, you choose which ascended blessing to accept. While you have an ascended blessing, you receive the benefits of its associated wyrmling blessing in addition to any new features of the ascended blessing. You can have only one blessing active at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a long rest.

Aquatic Command. While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Aquatic Affinity wyrmling blessing. You can cast the control water and dominate beast spells without expending spell slots. When you cast the dominate beast spell, you can target only beasts that can breathe water. You can cast each spell once in this way and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Crystallized Hunger. While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Hunger wyrmling blessing. When you kill a creature, you can crystallize a portion of its essence to create an essence gem. This gem functions as an ioun stone of protection, but it works only for you and has no value. As a bonus action, you can destroy the gem to regain one expended spell slot. You can have only one essence gem at a time. If you create a new essence gem while you already have an essence gem, the previous gem crumbles to dust and is destroyed. Once you create an essence gem, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

Draconic Senses. While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Sight wyrmling blessing. You have blindsight out to a range of 15 feet, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

Elemental Expertise. While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Elemental Versatility wyrmling blessing. When you cast a spell that deals damage of the chosen type, including a spell you changed using Elemental Versatility, you add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of the spell. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to deal damage of the chosen type equal to your proficiency bonus to the attacker. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    <autolevel level="1">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Otherworldly Patron: Animal Lords (HB)</name>
        <text>While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in the fey courts and the Upper Planes. These timeless entities are connected to every animal of the kind they represent, and their primary concerns are for the well-being of these animals and the natural world as a whole.
	Your patron is one such animal lord. Animal lords are varied in their motivations and often come into conflict with each other. They each command legions of animal followers and gather information from all of them. Unlike many other patrons, animal lords often have close relationships with those they bind with pacts, some to control, others to guide and advise. You are your animal lord's hand in the affairs of humanoids, and your allies are as numerous as the spiders in the corner or the birds in the sky.
	You choose a specific animal lord to be your patron using the Animal Lord table. Each type of animal in the world can potentially have an animal lord. If you want to follow a specific type of animal lord, work with your GM to determine the animal lord's affinity and beast type and where that animal lord fits in the world. For a deeper dive on specific animal lords and for their game statistics, see Creature Codex and Tome of Beasts 2. These books aren't required to choose an animal lord as your patron or to play this class option.

Animal Lords:
Animal Lord | Affinity | Beast Type
Bat King | Air | Bats
Brother Ox | Earth | Hooved mammals
Lord of Vultures | Air | Vultures, birds of prey
Mouse King | Earth | Rodents
Queen of Birds | Air | Birds
Queen of Cats | Earth | Felines
Queen of Serpents | Earth | Reptiles
Queen of Scorpions | Earth | Arachnids
Toad King | Water | Amphibians

        <text>At 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to discern your foe's flaws to aid in its downfall. You can use an action to analyze one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and impart this information to your companions. You and a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus each gain one of the following benefits (your choice). This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the analyzed creature dies.

	• You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the analyzed creature.

	• You gain a + 1 bonus to the damage roll when you hit the analyzed creature with an attack.

	• You have advantage on saving throws against the spells and effects of the analyzed creature.

	• When the analyzed creature attacks you, you gain a +I1bonus to Armor Class.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 10th level in this class, each +1 bonus increases to +2.

        <name>Patron Companion (Animal Lords (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, your patron sends you a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. The companion acts as the animal lord's eyes and ears, allowing your patron to watch over you, and, at times, advise, warn, or otherwise communicate with you.
	Choose a beast that relates to your patron (as shown in the Beast Type column in the Animal Lords table) that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. If you have the Pact of the Chain Pact Boon, this beast becomes your familiar.
	Your patron companion is friendly to you and your companions, and you can speak with it as if you shared a language. It obeys your commands and, in combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. Your patron companion can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use a bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
	If your companion dies, your patron sends a new one to you after 24 hours. If your patron companions die too often, your patron might be reluctant to send a new one or might reprimand you in other ways.

	• Cat Eyes. You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.
	• Chameleonic. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
	• Fangs. You grow fangs. The fangs are a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your fangs, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and your fangs deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
	• Hold Breath. You can hold your breath for 10 minutes.
	• Keen Senses. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
	• Leap. Your jump distance is doubled.

        <name>Otherworldly Patron: Hunter in Darkness (HB)</name>
        <text>The Hunter in Darkness is an entity that sees all creatures as prey and enjoys instilling fear in its prey. It prefers intelligent prey over mere beasts, as their fear tastes so much sweeter. Hunters who display impressive prowess for hunting pique its interest. The Hunter in Darkness often bestows its power on such individuals to spread fear further than the Hunter can by itself.
	Though your patron isn't mindless, it cares only for the thrill of the hunt and the spreading of fear. It cares not what you do with the power it grants you beyond that. Your connection with the Hunter can sometimes cause changes in your worldview. You might view every creature you meet as either predator or prey, or you might face problems with a "kill or be killed" attitude.

Pact of the Tome. Your tome contains descriptions of tracks made by a multitude of creatures. If you consult your tome for 1 minute while inspecting tracks, you can identify the type of creature that left the tracks (such as a winter wolf), though not the creature's name or specific appearance (such as Frosttooth, the one-eyed leader of a notorious pack of winter wolves that terrorizes the area).

Before the rise of human civilization, before the time of the elves, before even the dragons, there were the forests. Empires rise and fall around them, but the forests remain as a testament to nature's endurance.
	However, times are changing, and the unchecked growth of civilization threatens the green. The intelligences that imbue the antediluvian forests seek emissaries in the world that can act beyond their boughs, and one has heard your call for power. You are a guardian of the Old Wood, a questing branch issuing from a vast, slumbering intelligence sent to act on its behalf, perhaps even to excise these lesser beings from its borders.

Pact of the Blade. The blade of the Old Wood is a weapon made of wood and thorns and grows out of your palm. When you cast shillelagh, your Pact Blade is affected by the spell, regardless of the form your Pact Blade takes.

Pact of the Tome. The Old Wood grows a tome for you. The tome's cover is hardened bark from the forest's native trees, and its pages are leaves whose color changes with the seasons. If you want to add a new spell to your book, you must first plant it in the ground. After 1 hour, the book emerges from the soil with the new spell inscribed on its leaves.

        <text>Starting at 14th level, you can channel the power of the forest to physically transform, taking on many of its aspects. Your legs, arms, and torso elongate, your body becomes covered in thick, dark bark, and branches sprout from your head as your hair recedes. You can transform as a bonus action and the transformation lasts 1 minute. While transformed, you gain the following benefits:

	• Your Armor Class is 16 plus your Dexterity modifier.

	• You gain tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet, and your attacks can reach 5 feet further.

	• Your hands become branch-like claws, and you can use the Attack action to attack with the claws. You are proficient with the claws, and the claws count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You add your Charisma modifier to your attack and damage rolls with the claws. The damage is slashing and the damage die is a d6. If you have the Pact of the Blade feature, your claw attack benefits from your invocations as if it was a pact weapon.

	• Your Sap Magic feature changes to Arcasynthesis: When a spell of sth level or lower is cast within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to synthesize the magic. The spell resolves as normal, but you have a 50 percent chance of regaining 1d10 hp per level of the spell cast.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>Some who search for power settle on lesser gods or demon lords, others delve into deeper mysteries until they touch elder entities. These great entities build worlds, crafting mountains and species as if sculpting clay, or annihilate them utterly. Embodying creation, destruction, and the land itself, your patron is an ancient power beyond mortal understanding.
	Primordials stand in opposition to the Great Old Ones, the other side of the scale that maintains the balance of reality. Your primordial patron speaks to you in the language of omens, dreams, or intuition, and may call upon you to defend the natural world, to root out the forces of the Void, or even to manipulate seemingly random people or locations for reasons known only to their unfathomable purpose. While you can't grasp the full measure of your patron's designs, as long as your bond is strong, there is nothing that can stand in your way.

        <text>At 1st level, you can use an action to call upon the bond between your primordial patron and the world it created to ripple shockwaves through the ground. Choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you, then choose if the ripples happen in a 30-foot cone, a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, or a 20-foot-radius burst. The ripples originate from or are centered on the point you chose, depending on the form the ripples take. Each creature in the cone, line, or burst must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. If the ground in the area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least I minute to clear by hand.

	You can use these dice to turn the odds in your or your ally's favor.
