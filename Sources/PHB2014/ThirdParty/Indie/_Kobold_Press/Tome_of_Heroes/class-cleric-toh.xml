        <name>Divine Domain: Black Powder Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>The Black Powder domain focuses on the explosive, unpredictable, and destructive capacity of black powder. Deities with a vested interest in alchemy or deities who revel in destruction can claim influence over this domain. Deities of destruction need not be evil; such gods may represent natural chaos and destruction, reveling just as much in the unpredictable destructive capacity of black powder as in the chaotic destruction wrought by a volcanic eruption. In areas where warfare involves alchemical weapons or firearms, gods of war might also claim influence over this domain.

Domain Spells:
At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Black Powder Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | fog cloud, thunderwave
3rd | heat metal, shatter
5th | fireball, stinking cloud
7th | confusion, wall of fire
9th | cloudkill, deadly salvo*

        <name>Bonus Proficiencies (Black Powder Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies or gunsmith's tools (your choice). You also gain proficiency with all simple and martial weapons that have the gunpowder weapon property, and when throwing an item with the gunpowder weapon property, such as a bomb, you don't treat the item as an improvised weapon.

        <name>Channel Divinity: Imbue/Remove Explosivity (Black Powder Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the power of black powder, infusing it into the weapons of allies to make them more deadly, or revoke your god's blessing, lessening the effects of enemy firearms.
	As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke explosive energy that instills your Gunpowder Blessing on one weapon possessed by each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you for 1 minute.
	Alternatively, you can curse a number of weapons with the gunpowder weapon property equal to your proficiency bonus within 30 feet of you for 1 minute. Each affected weapon loses the ability to experience a burst for the duration. A remove curse spell cast on the weapon restores its full function.

        <name>Explosive Infusion (Black Powder Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 6th level, you can imbue an object you are holding or carrying with explosive power. The object must be nonmagical and small enough to fit in one hand, such as a glass vial or a ball bearing. As a bonus action, you can expend a 1st-level spell slot to fill the item with explosive power for 1 minute. Before the duration ends, you can use an action to throw the object at a point you can see up to 20 feet away, where it explodes on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage can experience bursts, as described in the gunpowder weapon property, but this effect counts as a single effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can burst, regardless of the number of targets affected.
	If you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. If you expend a use of your Channel Divinity as part of the action to throw the object, each creature within 20 feet of the point of impact must make the saving throw. If you don't throw the object before the duration ends, the magic fades, and the item becomes a normal object once again.

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

        <name>Greater Explosive Infusion (Black Powder Domain (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 17th level, you can imbue explosive power into larger objects with your Explosive Infusion. The target must be an object that isn't being worn or carried at the time you imbue it, must be no larger than can fit in a single 5-foot cube, and must be nonmagical. Your infusion fills the object with explosive power for Io minutes. Before the duration ends, you can detonate the object as an action, provided you are within 100 feet of it. Alternatively, you can detonate the object as a reaction to a specific event (a particular creature or certain number of creatures move within 20 feet of the object, for example), or you can set a specific time for the object to detonate, up to 1o minutes from the time at which you infused the object. If you set the object to detonate at a specific time, you don't need to be within 100 feet of the object for it to detonate.
	When the object detonates, each creature within 20 feet of the object must make the saving throw. If you expend a use of your Channel Divinity when you first imbue the object, each creature in the area when it detonates has disadvantage on the saving throw. At any point before the object detonates, you can touch it as an action to disperse the energy and cause it to become a normal object once again, regaining the spell slot you expended to infuse the object.

        <name>Divine Domain: Hunt Domain (Tome of Heroes HB)</name>
        <text>Many terrible creatures prey on the villages, towns, and inns that dot the forests of Midgard. When such creatures become particularly aggressive or can't be dissuaded by local druids, the settlements often call on servants of gods of the hunt to solve the problem.
	Deities devoted to hunting value champions who aid skillful hunters or who lead hunts themselves. Similarly, deities focused on protecting outlier settlements or who promote strengthening small communities also value such clerics. While these clerics might not have the utmost capability for tracking and killing prey, their gods grant them blessings to ensure successful hunts. These clerics might use their abilities to ensure their friends and communities have sufficient food to survive difficult times, or they might enjoy the sport of pursuing and slaying intelligent prey.

        <name>Divine Domain: Mercy Domain (HB)</name>
        <text>Mercy can mean promoting healing instead of harm, but it can also mean ending suffering with a quick death. These often-contradictory ideals are the two sides of mercy. The tenets of deities who embody mercy promote ways to end bloody conflicts or deliver healing magics to those in need. While mercy for some may be benevolent, for others it is decidedly not so. More pragmatic mercy gods teach the best method to relieve the agony and torment brought on by monsters and the forces of evil is to bring about the end of that evil.
