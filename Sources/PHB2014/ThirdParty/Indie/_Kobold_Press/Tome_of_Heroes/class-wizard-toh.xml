        <name>Arcane Tradition: Cantrip Adept (HB)</name>
        <text>It's easy to dismiss the humble cantrip as nothing more than an unsophisticated spell practiced by hedge wizards that proper mages need not focus on. But clever and cautious wizards sometimes specialize in such spells because while other mages fret when they're depleted of arcane resources, Cantrip Adepts hardly even notice... and at their command, the cantrips are not so humble.

        <name>Cantrip Polymath (Cantrip Adept (HB))</name>
        <text>At 2nd level, you gain two cantrips of your choice from any spell list. For you, these cantrips count as wizard cantrips and don't count against the number of cantrips you know. In addition, any cantrip you learn or can cast from any other source, such as from a racial trait or feat, counts as a wizard cantrip for you.

        <text>Each wizard has a strong connection with their familiar, but some mages eschew specializing in a school of magic in favor of forming a powerful bond with a familiar. This bond allows the two to work in tandem in ways that few arcane practitioners could even dream of. Those who encounter such a familiar never look at a rodent or bird the same way again.

        <name>Familiar Savant (Familiar Master (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning when you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you learn the find familiar spell if you don't know it already. You innately know this spell and don't need to have it scribed in your spellbook or prepared in order to cast it. When you cast find familiar, the casting time is 1 action, and it requires no material components.
	You can cast find familiar without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
	In addition, when you cast the find familiar spell, you can choose for your familiar to take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1/4 or lower, such as a flying snake, giant moth (see Creature Codex), or giant armadillo (see Tome of Beasts 2). The familiar has the statistics of the chosen beast form, but it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
	When you reach 6th level in this class, your familiar can take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1 or lower. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, your familiar can be any Tiny celestial, dragon, fey, or fiend that is CR 1 or lower.

        <name>Greater Familiar (Familiar Master (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 2nd level, when you cast find familiar, your familiar gains the following additional benefits:

	• Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, and it uses your proficiency bonus in place of its own when making ability checks and saving throws. It is proficient in any saving throw in which you are proficient.

	• Your familiar's hit points equal its normal hit point maximum or 1 + your Intelligence modifier + three times your wizard level, whichever is higher. It has a number of Hit Dice (d4s) equal to your wizard level.

	• In combat, your familiar shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take any action in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the familiar can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

	• Your familiar's attacks are enhanced by the magic bond you share with it. When making attack rolls, your familiar uses your spell attack bonus or its normal attack bonus, whichever is higher. In addition, when your familiar hits with an attack, the attack deals force damage equal to 1d4 + its Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus instead of its normal damage. If the familiar's attack normally deals additional damage, such as a flying snake's poison, or has an additional effect, such as an octopus's grapple, the familiar's attack still has that additional damage or effect.

	• Your familiar's Intelligence increases to 8 unless it is already higher. It can understand and speak Common and either Celestial (if celestial), Sylvan (if fey), or Abyssal or Infernal (if fiend).

In addition, you can access your familiar's senses by using either an action or a bonus action, and whenever your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can expend its reaction to deliver any wizard spell you cast. If the spell has a range of s feet or more, you must be sharing your familiar's senses before casting the spell. If the spell requires an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you use your own statistics to adjudicate the result.

        <text>While most wizards who desire power over the dead focus their efforts on necromancy, there are other, rarer, paths one can choose. Gravebinders focus their efforts on safeguarding tombs and graveyards to ensure the dead remain at rest and the living remain safe from the dead. When undead rise to prey upon the living, a gravebinder hunts downs the abominations and returns them to their eternal slumber.

Restriction: The Dead Must Rest
When you choose this wizard arcane tradition, you can no longer cast spells that animate, conjure, or create undead, and, if any such spells are copied in your spellbook, they fade from the book within 24 hours, leaving blank pages where the spells were.

        <name>Arcane Arms (School of Black Powder (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can imbue your firearm with arcane power to create minor magical effects. As an action, you can invoke one of the following effects, provided you have a gun in your hand. The effects created by this feature don't cause the firearm to release an audible boom, but other attacks or effects from your firearm still create the sound. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Arcane Dusting. You shoot a 15-foot cone of magical dust from the barrel of your firearm. Each creature or object in the area that is currently being affected by a spell, such as mage armor, or that is magical, such as bracers of archery, glows until the end of your next turn, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.

Flare. You fire a bright ball of magical light from the barrel of your firearm. If fired into the air, the ball rises to a maximum height of 100 feet, unless stopped by an intervening obstacle, hovers until the end of your next turn, then falls slowly, reaching the ground by the end of the next round. The light extinguishes when it hits the ground. The flare can be seen up to 1 mile away in daylight or up to 5 miles in darkness. Alternatively, the flare can be fired up to 50 feet away in any other direction. Each creature within 5 feet of the path of the flare must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight for 1 minute.

Lockbuster. You fire a magical shot from your firearm at a lock within the weapon's normal range. Make an attack roll with the firearm. If the result is equal to or exceeds the DC required to pick the lock, your shot destroys the lock. You have advantage on this attack roll if the lock is protected by magic, such as the arcane lock spell.

Smokescreen. A cloud of smoke billows from your firearm, creating a 10-foot-radius sphere of smoke centered on you. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. When you reach 6th level, the sphere's radius increases to 20 feet.

Starter's Gun. You discharge your firearm into the air. Each friendly creature of your choice within 30 feet of you has its speed increased by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level, each affected creature can also Dash as a bonus action on its turn.

Tracer Shot. You fire a ball of light at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack with your firearm. On a hit, the attack deals damage as normal, and the target is outlined in light, as if affected by the faerie fire spell, until the start of your next turn. When you reach 10th level, the target is outlined in light for 1 minute.

        <text>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that requires a melee spell attack roll, you can instead project the spell through your firearm, using the firearm's normal range as the range of the spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
	In addition, your attacks with a firearm count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

        <name>Improved Arcane Arms (School of Black Powder (HB))</name>
        <text>At 10th level, you are able to imbue your firearm with more powerful magical effects. When you use your Arcane Arms feature, you can choose one of the following effects instead. In addition, you can expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to regain a number of expended uses of your Arcane Arms feature equal to half the level of the spell slot.

False Shot. You fire an illusionary shot at a target within 30 feet, your weapon booming and smoking as if you had actually made an attack. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is paralyzed with fear until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

Invigorating Burst. You discharge your firearm into the air, dispersing a magical dust that settles around you. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of you, including yourself, gains 2d4 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

Shot in the Arm. As a bonus action, you can fire a crackling bolt of energy from your firearm at a friendly creature you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is suffering from exhaustion, its level of exhaustion is reduced by 1. If not, the target gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour and has advantage on its next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

Warning Shot. You fire a shot into the air, producing a magically enhanced, thunderous boom. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you becomes indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if an affected target is attacked, is harmed by a spell, witnesses any of its allies being harmed, or if you use your firearm to invoke another Arcane Arms effect before the duration ends.

If you do, you gain a bonus on the attack roll equal to the spell's level. If you hit the target, the force of the shot continues in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide directly away from you and originating from the target. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.
	On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 force damage for each slot level of the spell expended. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage can experience bursts, as described in the gunpowder weapon property, but this effect counts as a single effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can burst, regardless of the number of targets affected.

        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Liminality (HB)</name>
        <text>Liminal spaces are spaces on the boundary, at the edge between what's real and what's unreal. A liminal space can be neither here nor there, and yet be both here and there at the same time. Stories of liminal spaces are common across cultures, though their true nature often isn't recognized by the uninitiated: the stranger who appears suddenly at a lonely crossroads, the troll that snatches at unwary travelers from a hiding spot beneath a bridge where no such hiding spot exists, the strangely familiar yet unsettlingly different scene that's sometimes glimpsed in a looking glass.
	These are only the most obvious encounters with liminal spaces! Most liminalities are more easily overlooked, being as unconscious as the heartbeat between waking and sleeping, as fleeting as drawing in breath as an apprentice and exhaling it as a master, or as unassumingly familiar-and as fraught with potential—as a doorway that's crossed a hundred times without incident.
	Those who specialize in liminal magic are known as liminists. They've learned to tap into the mysticism at the heart of spaces between spaces and to bend the possibilities inherent in transitional moments to their own ends. Like filaments of a dream, strands of liminality can be woven into forms new and wondrous—or strange and terrifying.

        <text>At 2nd level, you can control the moment between an attempt at something and the result of that attempt to shift the flow of battle in your favor. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you misses with an attack, you can use your reaction to allow that creature to reroll the attack. Similarly, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits with an attack but hasn't yet rolled damage, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll the attack and use the lower result. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
	When you reach 10th level in this class, you can use this feature when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or saving throw.

        <text>At 14th level, your mastery over moments of change is unequivocal. You can use an action to touch a willing creature or make a melee spell attack against an unwilling creature, choosing one of the following effects. The effect lasts for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Rapid Advancement. The target's ability scores are each increased by 2. An ability score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.

Regression. The target's ability scores are each reduced by 2. This effect can't reduce an ability score below 1.

True Self. The target can't change its shape through any means, including spells, such as polymorph, and traits, such as the werewolf's Shapechanger trait. The target immediately reverts to its true form if it is currently in a different form. This option has no effect on illusion spells, such as disguise self, or a creature that appears changed from the effects of an illusion, such as a hag's Illusory Appearance.

The new spell must be of the same school, must be on the wizard spell list, and must be of the same or lower level than the original spell. If the new spell has any material components with a cost, you must provide those when changing the scroll's original spell to the new spell, and the components are consumed as the new spell's magic overwrites the original spell on the scroll.

	In addition, while concentrating on a spell with a duration of concentration up to 1 minute or concentration up to 10 minutes, you can amplify a wizard spell you cast of 1st level or higher. When you amplify a spell in this way, the duration of the spell on which you are concentrating is reduced by a number of rounds (if the duration is concentration up to 1 minute) or minutes (if the duration is concentration up to 10 minutes) equal to the amplified spell's level. You can choose only one of the following options when amplifying a spell:

	• Increase the saving throw DC by 2

	• Increase the spell attack bonus by 2

	• Add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of the spell.

When you must make a saving throw to end an ongoing effect, such as the frightened condition of the fear spell or the slowing effect of a copper dragon's slowing breath, you have advantage on the saving throw.
	In addition, when an ongoing condition you successfully end on yourself was from a spell cast by a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make the same saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature suffers the effect or condition you just ended on yourself until the end of its next turn. For example, if you succeed on the saving throw to end the paralyzed condition on yourself from the hold person spell cast by a spellcaster you can see, you can force that spellcaster to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, and that spellcaster becomes paralyzed until the end of its next turn on a failed save.
