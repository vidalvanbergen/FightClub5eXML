    <text>This armor consists of a thick coat that extends just below the waist. It is made of heavy cloth or canvas that is lined internally with small metal plates. Lighter, sleeveless variants of this armor are popular among nobles in court, but these variants use the same statistics as leather armor and protect only the upper body.

    <text>Made of silver coins from conquered nations and backed by a layer of quilted red wormsilk, these hauberks are typically awarded to soldiers, mercenaries, and generals with conspicuous valor in the campaign that conquered the land from where the coins originated. While wearing this armor, you have resistance to piercing damage from nonmagical weapons. If the piercing damage is from a critical hit, the armor loses this property until you spend a short rest repairing it (no special tools or check required).

    <text>Made from an alloy of steel and crystalline stone, this unique form of plate armor represents the height of dwarven metallurgy. It consists of overlapping, interlocking plates that cover the entire body, and it includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, and a helmet. Stonesteel is heavy and somewhat unwieldy but offers superior protection to standard plate. Donning and doffing stonesteel armor takes twice as long as normal plate armor.

    <text>This shield consists of overlapping metal segments fastened to leather straps and wrapped around the upper and lower arm. You can don or doff a manica as an action. Though the manica provides less protection than other shields, it allows you free use of your shield hand. You can't gain the manica's bonus to AC while wielding a weapon in that hand, and, as normal, you can benefit from only one shield at a time.

    <text>Special: Barge poles (or quant poles) are about 10 feet long with a cap at one end and a prong at the other. Primarily used to propel or steer barges through the water, the forked prong at one tip prevents the pole from sinking into muck in the riverbed. Barge poles can be wielded as a bludgeoning weapon or used to stab with the prong for 1d4 piercing damage.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>This weapon resembles a small pickaxe with a very long handle. It is equally as suited for digging as for throwing at an opponent.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt
Magazine: 6

This weapon resembles a traditional light crossbow but with a removable, wooden and clockwork magazine. Though this crossbow is lighter and less powerful than a heavy crossbow, its magazine allows for faster volleys. The attached magazine must have at least one bolt loaded into it to make a ranged attack with this weapon.

Magazine: This weapon can hold several pieces of ammunition in a removable box, cylinder, or other container. A value appears with the property, indicating how much ammunition its magazine can hold. Each time you make an attack roll with this weapon, a piece of ammunition is expended from the magazine. This weapon doesn't need to be reloaded between each attack, provided the magazine has ammunition remaining, allowing you to make multiple attacks with the weapon if you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action. When the ammunition from the magazine is depleted, you can swap out the empty magazine for a full magazine as an action or bonus action. Refilling an empty magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Gunpowder: Gunpowder is an often-unpredictable substance. As such, firearms, bombs, and other weapons and items utilizing gunpowder have the potential to deal significant damage. If you roll the highest possible number on an individual damage die (such as a 6 on a d6 or a 12 on a d12) when you attack with this weapon, you can roll that die again and add the result to the total. For example, if your 2d4 roll resulted in a 3 and a 4, you can reroll the 4, adding the result to the current total of 7. When a damage die results in the highest possible number on the die, it is called a "burst."
	If you roll the highest possible number again, you can roll the damage die again and add the result to the total, further increasing the weapon's damage. Any of the damage dice for this weapon, including extra dice such as from a critical hit or sneak attack, can burst and result in a reroll. For each attack you make with this weapon, you can reroll only a number of burst dice equal to your proficiency bonus, regardless of how many damage dice result in the highest possible number.
	For example, a 2nd-level rogue fires a pistol and scores a critical hit with sneak attack. The character rolls 4d6 damage dice that result in a 1, a 3, a 6 and another 6. The character then rerolls each 6, resulting in a 4 and a 6. The character adds those results to the current damage total for a final damage total of 26. Since the character's proficiency bonus is +2, the character can't reroll the new 6, ending the gunpowder bursts for that attack. When that character makes another attack with the pistol, this process starts anew.
	If a single attack with a weapon or item with this property hits multiple targets, the damage is treated as one attack or effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can experience a burst, regardless of how many targets take the damage.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Double-Headed: 1d4

Double-Headed: This weapon has a head on either end of it. You can use two-weapon fighting with this weapon, provided you are using only this weapon and no others for your attacks, even if this weapon doesn't have the light property. When you use two-weapon fighting with this weapon, you must use the opposite head for the bonus attack. The damage value in parenthesis is the damage for the opposite head of the weapon when used as part of two-weapon fighting. If the opposite head's damage type is different from the weapon's base damage type, it is noted in the weapon's description.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
