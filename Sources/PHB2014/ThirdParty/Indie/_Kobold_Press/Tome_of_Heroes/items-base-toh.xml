    <text>This armor consists of a thick coat that extends just below the waist. It is made of heavy cloth or canvas that is lined internally with small metal plates. Lighter, sleeveless variants of this armor are popular among nobles in court, but these variants use the same statistics as leather armor and protect only the upper body.

    <text>Made of silver coins from conquered nations and backed by a layer of quilted red wormsilk, these hauberks are typically awarded to soldiers, mercenaries, and generals with conspicuous valor in the campaign that conquered the land from where the coins originated. While wearing this armor, you have resistance to piercing damage from nonmagical weapons. If the piercing damage is from a critical hit, the armor loses this property until you spend a short rest repairing it (no special tools or check required).

    <text>Made from an alloy of steel and crystalline stone, this unique form of plate armor represents the height of dwarven metallurgy. It consists of overlapping, interlocking plates that cover the entire body, and it includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, and a helmet. Stonesteel is heavy and somewhat unwieldy but offers superior protection to standard plate. Donning and doffing stonesteel armor takes twice as long as normal plate armor.

    <text>This weapon resembles a small pickaxe with a very long handle. It is equally as suited for digging as for throwing at an opponent.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>Ammo: crossbow bolt
Magazine: 6

This weapon resembles a traditional light crossbow but with a removable, wooden and clockwork magazine. Though this crossbow is lighter and less powerful than a heavy crossbow, its magazine allows for faster volleys. The attached magazine must have at least one bolt loaded into it to make a ranged attack with this weapon.

Magazine: This weapon can hold several pieces of ammunition in a removable box, cylinder, or other container. A value appears with the property, indicating how much ammunition its magazine can hold. Each time you make an attack roll with this weapon, a piece of ammunition is expended from the magazine. This weapon doesn't need to be reloaded between each attack, provided the magazine has ammunition remaining, allowing you to make multiple attacks with the weapon if you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action. When the ammunition from the magazine is depleted, you can swap out the empty magazine for a full magazine as an action or bonus action. Refilling an empty magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Gunpowder: Gunpowder is an often-unpredictable substance. As such, firearms, bombs, and other weapons and items utilizing gunpowder have the potential to deal significant damage. If you roll the highest possible number on an individual damage die (such as a 6 on a d6 or a 12 on a d12) when you attack with this weapon, you can roll that die again and add the result to the total. For example, if your 2d4 roll resulted in a 3 and a 4, you can reroll the 4, adding the result to the current total of 7. When a damage die results in the highest possible number on the die, it is called a "burst."
	If you roll the highest possible number again, you can roll the damage die again and add the result to the total, further increasing the weapon's damage. Any of the damage dice for this weapon, including extra dice such as from a critical hit or sneak attack, can burst and result in a reroll. For each attack you make with this weapon, you can reroll only a number of burst dice equal to your proficiency bonus, regardless of how many damage dice result in the highest possible number.
	For example, a 2nd-level rogue fires a pistol and scores a critical hit with sneak attack. The character rolls 4d6 damage dice that result in a 1, a 3, a 6 and another 6. The character then rerolls each 6, resulting in a 4 and a 6. The character adds those results to the current damage total for a final damage total of 26. Since the character's proficiency bonus is +2, the character can't reroll the new 6, ending the gunpowder bursts for that attack. When that character makes another attack with the pistol, this process starts anew.
	If a single attack with a weapon or item with this property hits multiple targets, the damage is treated as one attack or effect for the purposes of determining how many times the damage can experience a burst, regardless of how many targets take the damage.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>A cavalry saber employed to great effect by mounted warriors, the shashka can be swung while on horseback in a repeated, looping downward arc. When riding through enemy ranks, a mounted warrior employs a one-handed, whirling swing, crisscrossing the rider's pommel to strike at enemies on foot on both sides in a downward double arc.

Special: A shashka can't be wielded with two hands while you are mounted.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>Ammo: renaissance bullet

This firearm features a flared muzzle. When you fire the weapon, it releases bullets in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d4 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Special: Each time you use the blunderbuss, it expends 5 pieces of ammunition, and, as with all firearms, the ammunition can't be recovered at the end of battle. Firing a blunderbuss releases a thunderous boom that is audible out to 200 feet.

Gunpowder: Gunpowder is an often-unpredictable substance. As such, firearms, bombs, and other weapons and items utilizing gunpowder have the potential to deal significant damage. If you roll the highest possible number on an individual damage die (such as a 6 on a d6 or a 12 on a dı2) when you attack with this weapon, you can roll that die again and add the result to the total. For example, if your 2d4 roll resulted in a 3 and a 4, you can reroll the 4, adding the result to the current total of 7. When a damage die results in the highest possible number on the die, it is called a "burst."

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>This ranged weapon consists of two small weights tied together.

Special: A Medium or smaller creature hit by a bolas has its speed reduced to 0 until it is freed, and it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall prone. A set of bolas has no effect on formless creatures or creatures that are Large or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the bolas (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the bolas.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>Ammo: renaissance bullet

This long-barreled firearm holds a removable, metal, cylindrical magazine, which allows the firearm to be fired multiple times before needing to be reloaded. The attached magazine must have at least one paper cartridge loaded into it to make a ranged attack with this weapon.

Gunpowder: Gunpowder is an often-unpredictable substance. As such, firearms, bombs, and other weapons and items utilizing gunpowder have the potential to deal significant damage. If you roll the highest possible number on an individual damage die (such as a 6 on a d6 or a 12 on a dı2) when you attack with this weapon, you can roll that die again and add the result to the total. For example, if your 2d4 roll resulted in a 3 and a 4, you can reroll the 4, adding the result to the current total of 7. When a damage die results in the highest possible number on the die, it is called a "burst."

Magazine (8): This weapon can hold several pieces of ammunition in a removable box, cylinder, or other container. A value in parentheses appears with the property, indicating how much ammunition its magazine can hold. Each time you make an attack roll with this weapon, a piece of ammunition is expended from the magazine. This weapon doesn't need to be reloaded between each attack, provided the magazine has ammunition remaining, allowing you to make multiple attacks with the weapon if you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action. When the ammunition from the magazine is depleted, you can swap out the empty magazine for a full magazine as an action or bonus action. Refilling an empty magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use.
