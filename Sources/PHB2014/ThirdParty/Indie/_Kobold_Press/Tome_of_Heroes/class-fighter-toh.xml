        <text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain access to special maneuvers that can be enacted when the damage from your firearm attack causes a gunpowder burst (see the gunpowder weapon property in the Adventuring Gear chapter). In addition, the number of times you can roll burst damage on a single attack is 1 + your proficiency bonus.

Burst Maneuvers. You learn two burst maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed below. You can apply a burst maneuver as a reaction when you gain a burst on the damage roll of a weapon with the gunpowder property. The maneuver's effect is in addition to the extra damage dice from a burst. You can apply only one burst maneuver to any given attack, regardless of the number of bursts it has. If the maneuver calls for a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.
	You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
	You learn one additional burst maneuver of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new burst maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use an action to spend one of your Hit Dice and regain hit points. The hit points regained with this feature can be applied to yourself or to another creature you touch. Alternatively, you can heal another creature you touch when you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points during a short rest, instead of applying the regained hit points to yourself. If you are under an effect that increases the amount of healing you receive when spending Hit Dice, such as a spell or feat, that effect applies to the amount of hit points the target regains. Keep in mind, some effects that increase the healing of Hit Dice happen only when those Hit Dice are spent during a short rest, like a bard's Song of Rest.
	In addition, the number of Hit Dice you regain after a long rest is equal to half your total number of Hit Dice plus one. For example, if you have four Hit Dice, you regain three spent Hit Dice, instead of two, when you finish a long rest.

        <name>Temporal Strike (Timeblade (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to trigger one of the following effects:

	• Dislocative Step. You step outside of time and move to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. At 10th level, you can move up to 30 feet.

	• Dislocative Shove. You push the target of your attack to an unoccupied space you can see within Is feet of you. You can move the target only horizontally, and before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, the target can make a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier),
ending the movement in an unoccupied space next to the damaging terrain on a success. At 10th level, you can move the target up to 30 feet.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or it acts randomly for 1 minute as if under the effects of the confusion spell.

        <text>For untold ages, the dwarves have paid in blood to keep their subterranean homes safe. The keystone to the defense of the dwarven citadels are the tunnel watchers, warriors trained in the tight, uneven paths beneath the surface of the world. While the techniques of the tunnel watchers originated with the dwarves, others see the value in such specialization. Tunnel watchers can thus be found throughout the mountainous regions of the world.
