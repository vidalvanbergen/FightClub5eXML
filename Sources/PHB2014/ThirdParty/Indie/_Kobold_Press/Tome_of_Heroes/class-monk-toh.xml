        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Concordant Motion (HB)</name>
        <text>The monks of Concordant Motion follow a tradition developed and honed by various goblin and kobold clans that favored tactics involving swarming warriors. The tradition combines tactical disciplines designed to encourage groups to work as one unit with practical strategies for enhancing allies. Where many warrior-monks view ki as a power best kept within, the Way of Concordant Motion teaches its followers to project their ki into their allies through ascetic meditation and mental exercises. Followers of this tradition value teamwork and promote functioning as a cohesive whole above any search for triumph or glory.

        <text>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you spend ki on certain features, you can share some of the effects with your allies.

Flurry of Blows. When you spend ki to use Flurry of Blows, you can use a bonus action to empower up to two allies you can see within 30 feet of you instead of making two unarmed strikes. The next time an empowered ally hits a creature with an attack before the start of your next turn, the ally's attack deals extra damage of the attack's type equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

Patient Defense. When you spend ki to use Patient Defense, you can spend 1 additional ki point to share this defense with one ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally can immediately use the Dodge action as a reaction.

Step of the Wind. When you spend ki to use Step of the Wind, you can spend I additional ki point to share your mobility with one ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally can use a reaction to immediately move up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

        <name>Improved Feline Reflexes (Way of the Wildcat (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 11th level, when you take no damage after succeeding on a Dexterity saving throw as a result of the Evasion monk class feature, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward the source of the effect, such as the dragon or spellcaster that exhaled the lightning or cast the fireball that you avoided. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the source, you can spend 3 ki points to make one unarmed strike against it.

        <name>Hundred Step Strike (Way of the Wildcat (HB))</name>
        <text>At 17th level, you can use your Springing Pounce feature as many times each turn as you want, provided you have the movement and attacks to do so. You must still spend 1 ki point each time you channel your momentum into your attack. Each time you move after hitting a creature in this way, you don't provoke opportunity attacks. If you miss an attack, further movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal.
	If you use Flurry of Blows with Springing Pounce and hit a different creature with each attack, you can make one additional Springing Pounce attack without spending ki, provided you have the movement to do so.
