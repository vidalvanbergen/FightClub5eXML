    <name>Cold Iron %name%</name>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>M</type>
    <text>Fey are timeless creatures, inured to many of the world's threats—except weapons of cold-wrought iron. This metal undoes the very fabric of a fey creature's life as it blights their ageless flesh. A cold iron weapon is treated as magical when used against any fey creature, and it is the only weapon with any hope of harming the most powerful fey lords and ladies. However, cold iron weapons are difficult to construct. The skill and material required to produce such a weapon doubles its price or adds 100 gp to the cost, whichever is more. Finding a smith with the skill to make a durable weapon without the aid of fire is always difficult—and finding one with the courage to anger the fey courts may be even harder.</text>

    <name>Peachwood %name%</name>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>M</type>
    <text>Wood from fragrant peach trees is sometimes used to create weapons against the undead. Peachwood is no different than oak or pine if crafted into any other type of item. Any weapon can be made of peachwood, and a weapon made of peachwood deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit, regardless of its size or shape. However, when you hit an undead creature with a peachwood weapon, it is a magic weapon that deals damage as if it were the weapon of the type it resembles. For example, a peachwood greatsword deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage when it hits a human, but it deals 2d6 slashing damage when it hits a ghost.</text>

    <name>Soulbound Steel %name%</name>
    <detail>very rare</detail>
    <type>M</type>
    <text>Steel forged with the carefully prepared ashes of the fallen dead creates a special alloy known as soulbound steel. The steel is said to contain a sliver of the spirit of a warrior rendered into ashes. The strong, flexible metal has a light gray color and a beautiful, powdery finish, sometimes worked into frost-like patterns.
	Soulbound Steel is used to craft weapons and, rarely, shields. A weapon made of soulbound steel costs an additional 500 gp to create. This cost represents not only the price of the material used to make it, but the time, care, and expertise required to keep the sliver of soul intact without making the weapon less effective.
	When you make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw while holding or carrying an item made of soulbound steel, you can use a reaction to have advantage on the saving throw. Once you use this property of the item, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. You can benefit from this property only once each day, regardless of how many soulbound steel items you possess.</text>

    <text>Wave-washed steel, made from combining iron, wood ash, and a rare metal from deep within ancient mountains, has a unique wave-like pattern and is light, flexible, and very strong. It is used to craft weapons, never armor. A weapon made of wave-washed steel costs an additional 250 gp to create. This cost represents not only the price of the rare metal, but also the time and specialized expertise needed to craft the weapon from it. Only weapons made primarily of metal can be crafted from wave-washed steel (a longsword can be a wavewashed weapon, but a quarterstaff can't).
	When you score a critical hit with a weapon made of wave-washed steel against a creature wearing armor or that has natural armor, the target's armor is damaged and takes a cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers as the wave-washed steel weapon cuts through it. This reduction lasts until the armor is repaired (if crafted armor) or the creature finishes a long rest (if natural armor). A wave-washed steel weapon can't reduce a creature's AC below 10.</text>

    <name>Windforged Steel %name%</name>
    <detail>very rare</detail>
    <type>S,M</type>
    <text>Windforged steel is manufactured only in clifftop forges and is very strong and lightweight. It has a deep blue, nearly black color, never rusts, and has a remarkable ability to survive blows and magical effects that would destroy lesser metals. This remarkable metal is made into weapons and shields but seldom armor.
	An item made of windforged steel has advantage on saving throws to resist being damaged or destroyed, and attacks against it are made with disadvantage. Windforged steel items are immune to rust, including that caused by rust monsters and similar creatures.
	Windforged steel items weigh 25 percent less and have twice as many hit points as their counterparts made of more traditional metals. An item made from windforged steel costs 25 percent more than a standard item of that type.</text>

    <text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit a creature with it, you can choose to deal no damage to the target and instead store the energy of the attack within the blade for 1 minute. You can store up to three attacks in this way. When you hit a creature with this axe while you have at least one attack stored, you can release one or more stored attacks, adding the damage of those stored attacks to the damage of the current attack.
	Each time you release one or more stored attacks from the axe, you have a 10 percent chance of causing the axe to explode. The explosion deals 2d6 force damage to you for each attack you released from the axe, and it destroys the axe.</text>

    <text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target disappears and shuffles forward in time. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. When the target returns, it is unaware that any time has passed. If the target is concentrating on a spell and succeeds on the check to maintain concentration after taking damage from your attack with this weapon, the round it disappeared doesn't count against the spell's remaining duration.</text>
