        <text>In the caverns beneath the surface of the world, sound works differently. Your exposure to echoes has taught you about how sound changes as it moves and encounters obstacles. Inspired by the effect caves and tunnels have on sounds, you have learned to manipulate sound with your magic, curving it and altering it as it moves. You can silence the most violent explosions, you can make whispers seem to reverberate forever, and you can even change the sounds of music and words as they are created.

	At 14th level, your blindsight is now out to a range of 15 feet, and you no longer have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deafen you.

        <name>Alter Sound (College of Echoes (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you can manipulate the sounds of your speech to mimic any sounds you've heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check.
	In addition, you can manipulate some of the sounds around you. You can use your reaction to cause one of the following effects.

Enhance. You can increase the volume of a sound originating within 30 feet of you, doubling the range it can be heard and granting creatures in range of the sound advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the sound. In addition, when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you takes thunder damage, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and increase the thunder damage by an amount equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.

Dampen. You can decrease the volume of a sound originating within 30 feet of you, halving the range it can be heard and granting creatures in range of the sound disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the sound. In addition, when a friendly creature within 30 feet of you takes thunder damage, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and decrease the thunder damage by an amount equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.

Distort. You can change I word or up to 2 notes within 30 feet of you to another word or other notes. You can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to change a number of words within 30 feet of you equal to 1 + the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die, or you can change a number of notes of a melody within 30 feet of you equal to 2 + double the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. A creature that can hear the sound can notice it was altered by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. At your GM's discretion, this effect can alter sounds that aren't words or melodies, such as altering the cries of a young animal to sound like the roars of an adult.

Disrupt. When a spellcaster casts a spell with verbal components within 30 feet of you, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to disrupt the sounds of the verbal components. The spellcaster must succeed on a concentration check (DC 8 + the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die) or the spell fails and has no effect. You can disrupt a spell only if it is of a spell level you can cast.

        <text>Bards pick up all sorts of information as they travel the land. Some bards focus on a certain type of information, like epic poetry, love ballads, or bawdy drinking songs. Others, however, turn to the shadowy occupation of investigating crimes. These bards use their knack for gathering information to learn about criminals and vigilantes, their tactics, and their weaknesses. Some work with agents of the law to catch criminals, but shadier members of this college use their dark knowledge to emulate the malefactors they have studied for so long.

You have disadvantage on this check if the target is not a humanoid, and the check automatically fails against creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or lower.

	In addition, whenever your mark makes an attack roll, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to subtract the number rolled from the mark's attack roll. Alternatively, whenever you make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect from your mark, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to add the number rolled to your saving throw. You can choose to expend the Bardic Inspiration after the attack or saving throw is rolled but before the outcome is determined.

Their primary medium is information and secrets, though they are known to slip a dagger between ribs when necessary. Masters of insight and manipulation, these bards use every tool at their disposal in pursuit of their goals, and they value knowledge above all else. The more buried a secret, the deeper they delve to uncover it. Knowledge is power; it can cement empires or topple dynasties.
	College of Shadows bards undergo careful training before they're sent out into the world. Skilled in both music and manipulation, they're the perfect blend of charm and cunning. The tricks they learn in their tutelage make them ideal for the subtle work of coaxing out secrets, entrancing audiences, and dazzling the minds of their chosen targets.

At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids who witnessed the entire performance, up to a number equal to I plus your Charisma modifier. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.

On a failed save, a target suffers one of the following (your choice):

	• For 24 hours, the target believes the tale you told is true and will tell others the tale as if it were truth.

	• For 1 hour, the target believes someone nearby knows their darkest secret, and they have disadvantage on Charisma, Wisdom, and Intelligence ability checks and saving throws as they are distracted and overcome with paranoia.

	• The target becomes convinced that you (or one of your allies if you choose to sing the praises of another) are a fearsome opponent. For 1 minute, the target is frightened of you (or your ally), and you (or your ally) have advantage on attack rolls against the target.

A remove curse or greater restoration spell ends this effect early. You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

These minstrels gain a devoted following and rarely lack for company. Some of their devotees go so far as to put themselves at the service of the bard they admire. Though members of the college can be found as traveling minstrels and adventuring troubadours, they gravitate to large urban areas where their silver tongues and mind-bending performances have the greatest influence. Devious rulers sometimes seek out members of the college as counsellors, but the rulers must be wary lest they become a mere pawn of their new aide.

Your entourage is considered charmed by you and travels with you to see to your mundane needs, such as making your meals and doing your laundry. If you are in an urban area, they act as your messengers and gofers. When you put on a performance, they speak your praises and rouse the crowd to applause. In exchange for their service, you must provide your entourage a place to live and pay the costs for them to share the same lifestyle as you.
	Your entourage doesn't join combat or venture into obviously dangerous areas or situations. If you or your companions abuse or mistreat your entourage, they leave your service immediately. If this occurs, you can gain the service of a new entourage by traveling to a different urban area where you must perform at least 1 hour each day for one week.
	You gain another commoner at 6th level, and a final one at 14th level. If you prefer, instead of gaining a new commoner at 6th level, one member of your entourage can become a guard. At 14th level, if you have a guard, it can become your choice of a spy or veteran, instead of taking on a new commoner. If one member of your entourage becomes a guard, spy, or veteran, that person accompanies you into dangerous situations, but they only use the Help action to aid you, unless you use a bonus action to direct them to take a specific action. At the GM's discretion, you can replace the guard with another humanoid of CR 1/8 or lower, the spy with another humanoid of CR 1 or lower, and the veteran with another humanoid of CR 3 or lower.
