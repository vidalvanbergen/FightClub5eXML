        <text>People have used animals in their war efforts since time immemorial. As a beast trainer, you teach animals how to fight and survive on the battlefield. You also train them to recognize and obey your allies when you aren't able to direct them. While a beast trainer can train any type of animal, they often generate a strong bond with one species and focus their training on beasts of that type.

        <name>Trained Animals (Beast Trainer (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning when you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a beast companion. Choose a beast that is Medium or smaller and has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. The beast is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any commands that you issue to it. In combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. The beast can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics.
	If you are knocked unconscious, killed, or otherwise unable to command your trained animal, one of your allies can use a bonus action to command it by succeeding on a DC to Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.
	When you reach 7th level, you can have more than one trained animal at a time. All your trained animals can have a total challenge rating equal to a quarter of your level, rounded down. A beast with a challenge rating of 0 is considered to have a challenge rating of 1/8 for the purpose of determining the number of trained animals you can have. You can use a bonus action to direct all your trained animals to take the same action, or you can use an action to command all of them to take different actions.
	To have one or more trained animals, you must spend at least one hour each day practicing commands and playing with your animals, which you can do during a long rest.
	If a trained animal dies, you can use an action to touch the animal and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The animal returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

        <name>Trick Shot (Gunslinger (HB))</name>
        <text>You can use your firearms to pull off special feats of marksmanship. Trick shots provide special effects or secondary functions to your firearm attacks. Unless otherwise stated, you can use a trick shot as part of the same action you use to attack with the firearm. You can use only one trick shot each turn. If you are wielding a blunderbuss, you can use only the Deafening Blast and Haft Strike trick shots.
	If a trick shot requires a saving throw against its effects, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier. Some trick shots reference weapon options, which can be found in the Adventuring Rules chapter of this book.

Deafening Blast. As your bullet flies toward your target, you can cause one creature you can see within 5 feet of the path of the shot to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is deafened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Disarming Shot. You can use the Disarm weapon option when attacking with a firearm. If the target is beyond the normal range for the weapon, it has advantage on its saving throw. Use your trick shot DC for this saving throw instead of the weapon option DC Haft Strike. As a bonus action after you load your firearm, you can whip the weapon around and use the stock to make a melee attack at a target within 5 feet of you. This attack deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage if done with a one-handed firearm, or 1d8 bludgeoning damage with a two-handed firearm, plus your Strength modifier.

Improved Ricochet Shot. You can use the Ricochet Shot weapon option against a target that has total cover, provided you are aware of which space the target occupies.

Manipulate Object. You can fire a round from your gun to manipulate an object at a distance, up to the maximum range of your firearm. This allows you to take the Use an Object action from a distance, though your action is limited to things that can be done with the impact of the bullet, such as punching a button, moving a lever, severing a rope, or similar actions.
	You can also use this trick shot to move an object weighing no more than 10 pounds, pushing it up to 5 feet away from its original location. If an object is being worn or carried, the creature wearing or carrying it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to prevent the object from being moved.

Shifting Shot. You fire a shot into a space occupied by a Large or smaller creature, near its feet or body. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be compelled to move 5 feet in a direction of your choosing. The creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it would be compelled to move into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit.

Disruptive Shot. Make one ranged attack with your firearm. On a hit, if the target is concentrating on a spell, the DC of the Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration is equal to 1o or the full damage taken, whichever is higher.

Sharpshooter. Make one ranged attack with your firearm. Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on this attack roll. On a hit, double your damage dice for the attack. If you are firing a blunderbuss, choose one target in range to take the extra damage, rolling normally for the rest.

Stunning Shot. Make one ranged attack with your firearm. On a hit, the target takes damage as normal and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

        <text>At 3rd level, you gain an undead spirit that anchors itself to you and accompanies you on your journeys. The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See the spirit's game statistics in the Spirit Usher stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.
	You determine the spirit's appearance, name, and personality. You should choose a personality trait, ideal, bond, and flaw for it, and you should work with your GM to decide on a background story for the spirit that fits the campaign.
	In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
	When it joins with you, the spirit learns three cantrips it can cast at will, which you select from the following lists. At the end of a long rest, you can change which cantrips the spirit knows.

	• Choose one of chill touch, ray of frost, sacred flame, or vicious mockery. Use your level when determining the damage of the chosen cantrip.

	• Choose one of druidcraft, prestidigitation, or thaumaturgy.

	• Choose one of dancing lights, message, or minor illusion.

The spirit is bonded to you. It can't be turned or destroyed, such as with the cleric's Turn Undead feature. When the spirit usher dies, it retreats to the Ethereal Plane to restore itself and returns to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you when you finish a long rest. If the spirit usher died within the last hour, you can use your action to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to return it to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, you can take on limited serpentine aspects. When you finish a long rest, select one of the following features. You gain the benefit of the chosen feature until the next time you finish a long rest. Starting at 11th level, you can select two options when you finish a long rest.

Bite. You develop venomous fangs. When you use the Attack action and attack with a weapon, you can use a bonus action to bite a target within 5 feet of you with your fangs. You are proficient with the fangs, which deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) plus 1d8 poison damage on a hit.

Keen Smell. Your nose and olfactory organs change to resemble those belonging to a snake. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on scent and on Wisdom (Insight) checks.

Poison Resistance. You have resistance to poison damage.

Scales. Scales sprout along your body. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

Serpentine Movement. You have a climbing speed of 30 feet.

You can persuade a snake to perform small favors for you, such as carrying a written message to a nearby companion.

        <name>Decoy Skin (Snake Speaker (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 15th level, you learn to magically shed your skin and use it as an animate decoy. As an action, you can shed your skin, which creates a duplicate of yourself. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. It looks like you, has your Armor Class and saving throw bonuses, and has hit points equal to three times your ranger level. It lasts for 10 minutes or until it is reduced to 0 hit points.
	As a bonus action, you can command it to move up to your speed, using any form of movement you possess, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. Your decoy can't take actions or use your class features, but it otherwise moves as directed. While your decoy is within 5 feet of you, its appearance and movements so closely mimic yours that when a creature that can reach you and your decoy makes an attack against you, it has a 50 percent change of hitting your decoy instead.
	It looks exactly as you looked when you used this feature, and it is a convincing duplicate of you. A creature can discern that it isn't you with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

        <text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to call forth a magical, wooden spear from the land of fey into your empty hand as a bonus action. The spear disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You are proficient with the weapon while you wield it. The spear's range is 20/60 feet, and, when you throw the spear, it reappears in your hand after the attack. The spear's damage die is a d8, and it has the finesse and reach properties.
	At 7th level, your weald spear attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and your weald spear's damage die is a d10. At 11th level, your weald spear's damage die is a d12.

Aflame. Your spear is ensorcelled in heatless, white, magical flames whose intensity rise and fall to reflect your mood. When you are at your happiest, your spear sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

Entwined. Your spear appears to be wrapped in writhing green vines which occasionally coalesce into the shape of a slender, grasping hand. The hand always points in the direction of your home forest.

Everblooming. Your spear is covered in small wildflowers that bloom, die, bud, and bloom again within minutes. Pollinating insects are often drawn to your spear as the spear constantly exudes a pleasant, floral fragrance.

Moonlit. Your spear appears as a pale length of wooden moonlight. A trail of star-like motes travels behind the spear's point.

The target has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack, and the canopy bursts into shredded leaves afterwards. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Canopy again.
	When you reach 11th level in this class, you can use your Canopy twice between rests, and at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses.
