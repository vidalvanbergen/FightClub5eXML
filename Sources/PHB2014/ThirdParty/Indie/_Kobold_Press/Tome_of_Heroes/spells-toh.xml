The creature moves bodily through the intervening space (as opposed to teleporting), so there can be no physical obstacle (such as a wall or a door) in the path.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional willing creature for each slot level above 1st.

    <text>You touch a wooden, plaster, or stone surface and create a passage with two trapdoors. The first trapdoor appears where you touch the surface, and the other appears at a point you can see up to 30 feet away. The two trapdoors can be wooden with a metal ring handle, or they can match the surrounding surfaces, each with a small notch for opening the door. The two trapdoors are connected by an extradimensional passage that is up to 5 feet wide, up to 5 feet tall, and up to 30 feet long. The trapdoors don't need to be on the same surface, allowing the passage to connect two separated locations, such as the two sides of a chasm or river. The passage is always straight and level for creatures inside it, and the creatures exit the tunnel in such a way that allows them to maintain the same orientation as when they entered the passage. No more than five creatures can transit the passage at the same time.
	When the spell ends and the trapdoors disappear, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest the end of the passage closest to them.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the length of the passage and the distance you can place the second trapdoor increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

When an affected creature is within 5 feet of at least one other affected creature, they create a formation.

Affected creatures don't have to all be in the same formation, and they can create or end as many formations of various sizes as they want for the duration of the spell. Each creature in a formation gains a bonus depending on how many affected creatures are in that formation.

This spell causes the speech of affected creatures to sound like nonsense. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.
	An affected creature cannot communicate in any spoken language that it knows. When it speaks, the words come out as gibberish. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast. The spell does not affect telepathic communication, nonverbal communication, or sounds emitted by any creature that does not have a spoken language. As an action, a creature under the effect of this spell can attempt another Intelligence saving throw against the effect. On a successful save, the spell ends.

You capture some of the fading life essence of the triggering creature, drawing on the energy of the tenuous moment between life and death. You can then use this essence to immediately harm or help a different creature you can see within range. If you choose to harm, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. The target takes psychic damage equal to 6d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you choose to help, the target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell can't be triggered by the death of a construct or an undead creature, and it can't restore hit points to constructs or undead.

    <text>You gain a preternatural sense of the surrounding area, allowing you insights you can share with comrades to provide them with an edge in combat. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made when determining surprise at the beginning of a combat encounter. If you are not surprised, then neither are your allies. When you are engaged in combat while the spell is active, you can use a bonus action on your turn to produce one of the following effects (allies must be able to see or hear you in order to benefit):

	• One ally gains advantage on its next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.

	• An enemy has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you or an ally.

	• You divine the location of an invisible or hidden creature and impart that knowledge to any allies who can see or hear you. This knowledge does not negate any advantages the creature has, it only allows your allies to be aware of its location at the time. If the creature moves after being detected, its new location is not imparted to your allies.

	• Three allies who can see and hear you on your turn are given the benefit of a bless, guidance, or resistance spell on their turns; you choose the benefit individually for each ally. An ally must use the benefit on its turn, or the benefit is lost.

The target gains a few bestial qualities appropriate to the type of lycanthrope you choose, such as tufts of fur, elongated claws, a fang-lined maw or tusks, and similar features. For the duration, the target has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered. In addition, the target has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. Finally, the creature can use its new claws and jaw or tusks to make unarmed strikes. The claws deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + the target's Strength modifier on a hit. The bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + the target's Strength modifier on a hit. The target's bite doesn't inflict lycanthropy.

While holding one of the objects, you can sense the direction to the other object's location. If the paired object is in motion, you know the direction and relative speed of its movement (walking, running, galloping, or similar). When the two objects are within 30 feet of each other, they vibrate faintly unless they are touching. If you aren't holding either item and the spell hasn't ended, you can sense the direction of the closest of the two objects within 1,000 feet of you, and you can sense if it is in motion. If neither object is within 1,000 feet of you, you sense the closest object as soon as you come within 1,000 feet of one of them.
	If an inch or more of lead blocks a direct path between you and an affected object, you can't sense that object.

The bolstered structures can be up to 20 feet tall and shaped as you desire. You can ward several small buildings in a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell. For the purpose of this spell, "structures" include walls, such as the palisade that might surround a small fort, provided the wall is no more than 20 feet tall.
	For the duration, each structure you bolstered has a damage threshold of s. If a structure already has a damage threshold, that threshold increases by 5.
	This spell protects only the walls, support beams, roofs, and similar that make up the core components of the structure. It doesn't bolster objects within the structures, such as furniture.
	The protected structure or structures radiate magic. A dispel magic cast on a structure removes the bolstering from only that structure.
	You can create a permanently bolstered structure or collection of structures by casting this spell there every day for one year.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the square feet of floor space you can bolster increases by 500 and the damage threshold increases by 2 for each slot level above 3rd.

Terrifying and nightmarish monsters exist within the unknown void of the in-between. Choose up to six points you can see within range. Voidlike, magical darkness spreads from each point to fill a 10-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and no light, magical or nonmagical, can illuminate it.
	Each creature inside a sphere when this spell is cast must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6dıo piercing damage and 5d6 psychic damage and is restrained until it breaks free as unseen entities bite and tear at it from the Void. Once a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
	When a creature enters a sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in a sphere, that creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. The creature takes 5d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	Once created, the spheres can't be moved. A creature in overlapping spheres doesn't suffer additional effects for being in more than one sphere at a time.

This spell pushes a creature you touch through a dimensional portal, causing it to disappear and then reappear a short distance away. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, it disappears from its current location and reappears 30 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. This travel can take it through walls, creatures, or other solid surfaces, but the target can't reappear inside a solid object or not on solid ground; instead, it reappears in the nearest safe, unoccupied space along the path of travel.

    <text>Type: Liminal

You conjure a door to the destination of your choice that lasts for the duration or until dispelled. You sketch the outline of the door with chalk on any hard surface (a wall, a cliffside, the deck of a ship, etc.) and scribe sigils of power around its outline. The doorway must be at least I foot wide by 2 feet tall and can be no larger than 5 feet wide by 10 feet tall. Once the door is drawn, place the knob appropriately; it attaches magically to the surface and your drawing becomes a real door to the spell's destination. The doorway remains functional for the spell's duration. During that time, anyone can open or close the door and pass through it in either direction.
	The destination can be on any plane of existence. It must be familiar to you, and your level of familiarity with it determines the accuracy of the spell (determined by the GM). If it's a place you've visited, you can expect 100 percent accuracy. If it's been described to you by someone who was there, you might arrive in the wrong room or even the wrong structure, depending on how detailed their description was. If you've only heard about the destination third-hand, you may end up in a similar structure that's in a very different locale.
	Door of the far traveler doesn't create a doorway at the destination. It connects to an existing, working door. It can't, for example, take you to an open field or a forest with no structures (unless someone built a doorframe with a door in that spot for this specific purpose!). While the spell is in effect, the pre-existing doorway connects only to the area you occupied while casting the spell. If you connected to an existing doorway between a home's parlor and library, for example, and your door leads into the library, then people can still walk through that doorway from the parlor into the library normally. Anyone trying to go the other direction, however, arrives wherever you came from instead of in the parlor.
	Before casting the spell, you must spend one hour etching magical symbols onto the doorknob that will serve as the spell's material component to attune it to your desired destination. Once prepared, the knob remains attuned to that destination until it's used or you spend another hour attuning it to a different location.
	The door of the far traveler is dispelled if you remove the knob from the door. You can do this as a bonus action from either side of the door, provided it's shut. If the spell's duration expires naturally, the knob falls to the ground on whichever side of the door you're on. Once the spell ends, the knob loses its attunement to any location and another hour must be spent attuning it before it can be used again.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a 9th-level slot, the duration increases to 12 hours.

While affected by this spell, the target must use its action to attack the nearest creature other than itself or you. If the target starts its turn with no other creature near enough to move to and attack, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the target's head clears momentarily and it can act freely that turn. If the target starts its turn a second time with no other creature near enough to move to and attack, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

    <text>You create a furiously erupting volcano centered on a point you can see within range. The ground heaves violently as a cinder cone that is 2 feet wide and s feet tall bursts up from it. Each creature within 30 feet of the cinder cone when it appears must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
	Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the cinder cone produces additional effects on your turn.

Round 2: Smoke pours from the cinder cone. Each creature within 10 feet of the cinder cone when the smoke appears takes 4d6 poison damage. Afterwards, each creature that enters the smoky area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 2d6 poison damage. The smoke spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke until the start of your next turn, when the smoke reforms.

Round 3: Lava bubbles out from the cinder cone, spreading out to cover the ground within 20 feet of the cinder cone. Each creature and object in the area when the lava appears takes 10d10 fire damage and is on fire. Afterwards, each creature that enters the lava for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5d10 fire damage. In addition, the smoke spreads to fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the cinder cone.

Round 4: The lava continues spreading and covers the ground within 30 feet of the cinder cone in lava that is I-foot-deep. The lava-covered ground becomes difficult terrain. In addition, the smoke fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the cinder cone.

Round 5: The lava expands to cover the ground within 40 feet of the cinder cone, and the smoke fills a 40-foot radius sphere centered on the cinder cone. In addition, the cinder cone begins spewing hot rocks. Choose up to three creatures within 90 feet of the cinder cone. Each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and
заб fire damage.

Rounds 6-10. The lava and smoke continue to expand in size by 10 feet each round. In addition, each round you can direct the cinder cone to spew hot rocks at three targets, as described in Round 5.

When the spell ends, the volcano ceases erupting, but the smoke and lava remain for 1 minute before cooling and dispersing. The landscape is permanently altered by the spell.

You create a staircase out of the nothingness of the air. A shimmering staircase 10 feet wide appears and remains for the duration. The staircase ascends at a 45-degree angle to a point as much as 60 feet above the ground. The staircase consists only of steps with no apparent support, unless you choose to have it resemble a stone or wooden structure. Even then, its magical nature is obvious, as it has no color and is translucent, and only the steps have solidity; the rest of it is no more solid than air.

If your attack roll (not the adjusted result) was odd, the bolt leaps to a new target of your choice within range that has not already been targeted by frenzied bolt, requiring a new spell attack roll to hit. The bolt continues leaping to new targets until you roll an even number on your spell attack roll, miss a target, or run out of potential targets. You and your allies are legal targets for this spell if you are particularly lucky—or unlucky.

    <text>You summon a storm to batter your oncoming enemies. Until the spell ends, freezing rain and turbulent winds fill a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 300-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don't have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.
	The spell's area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. The ground in the area becomes slick, difficult terrain, and a flying creature in the area must land at the end of its turn or fall. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw as the wind and rain assail it. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 cold damage.
	If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.

On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to avoid your notice and is frightened of you while you are within its line of sight. While you are within 1 mile of the target, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track the target, and the target can't take a long rest, terrified you are just around the corner.

	When an affected creature travels, it travels at a fast pace in the opposite direction of the direction you chose as it believes a pack of dogs or wolves follows it from the chosen direction. When an affected creature isn't traveling, it is frightened of your chosen direction. The affected creature occasionally hears howls or sees glowing eyes in the darkness at the edge of its vision in that direction. An affected creature will not stop at a destination, instead pacing half-circles around the destination until the effect ends, terrified the pack will overcome it if it stops moving. An affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each 4-hour period, ending the effect on itself on a success.
	An affected creature moves along the safest available route unless it has nowhere to move, such as if it arrives at the edge of a cliff. When an affected creature can't safely move in the opposite direction of your chosen direction, it cowers in place, defending itself from hostile creatures but otherwise taking no actions. In such circumstances, the affected creature can repeat the saving throw every minute, ending the effect on itself on a success. The spell's effect is suspended when an affected creature is engaged in combat, allowing it to move as necessary to face hostile creatures.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 4 hours for each slot level above 5th. If an affected creature travels for more than 8 hours, it risks exhaustion as if on a forced march.

    <text>With a word, you gesture across an area and cause the terrain to rise up into a 10-foot-tall hillock at a point you choose within range. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. The hillock is up to 30 feet long and up to 15 feet wide, and it must be in a line. If the hillock cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the hillock or to the top of the hillock (your choice). The ranged attack distance for a creature on top of the hillock is doubled, provided the target is at a lower elevation than the creature on the hillock. At the GM's discretion, creatures on top of the hillock gain any additional bonuses or penalties that higher elevation might provide, such as advantage on attacks against those on lower elevations, being easier to spot, longer sight distance, or similar.
	The steep sides of the hillock are difficult to climb. A creature at the bottom of the hillock that attempts to move up to the top must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC to climb to the top of the hillock.
	This spell can't manipulate stone construction, and rocks and structures shift to accommodate the hillock. If the hillock's formation would make a structure unstable, the hillock fails to form in the structure's spaces. Similarly, this spell doesn't directly affect plant growth. The hillock carries any plants along with it.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, you can increase the width of the hillock by 5 feet or the length by 10 feet for each slot above 3rd.

You alter the mental state of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If it fails, choose one of the following effects. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected by this spell.

Sleep Paralysis: Overwhelming heaviness and fatigue overcome the creature, slowing it. The creature's speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on weapon attacks.

Phantasmata: The creature imagines vivid and terrifying hallucinations centered on a point of your choice within range. For the duration, the creature is frightened, and it must take the Dash action and move away from the point you chose by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.

False Awakening: The creature enters a trancelike state of consciousness in which it's not fully aware of its surroundings. It can't take reactions, and it must roll a d4 at the beginning of its turn to determine its behavior. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Intelligence saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

Hypnagogia Behaviors:
d4 | Behavior
1 | The creature takes the Dash action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
2 | The creature uses its action to pantomime preparing for its day: brushing teeth and hair, bathing, eating, or similar activity.
3 | The creature moves up to its speed toward a randomly determined creature and uses its action to make one melee attack against that creature. If there is no creature within range, the creature does nothing this turn.
4 | The creature does nothing this turn.

Strange things happen in the mind and body in that moment between waking and sleeping. One of the most common is being startled awake by a sudden feeling of falling.

A creature inside it has three-quarters cover from attacks outside the vehicle, which contains arrow slits, portholes, and other small openings.
	A creature piloting the armored vehicle can take the Careen action.

On a success, the restrained creature is freed, and the snare resets itself 1 minute later. If the creature succeeds on the check by s or more, the snare is destroyed instead.
	This spell alerts you with a ping in your mind when the trap is triggered if you are within 1 mile of the snare. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional snare for each slot level above 3rd. When you receive the mental ping that a trap was triggered, you know which snare was triggered if you have more than one.

    <text>You touch one creature and choose either to become its champion, or for it to become yours. If you choose a creature to become your champion, it fights on your behalf. While this spell is in effect, you can cast any spell with a range of touch on your champion as if the spell had a range of 60 feet. Your champion's attacks are considered magical, and you can use a bonus action on your turn to encourage your champion, granting it advantage on its next attack roll.
	If you become the champion of another creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against creatures that have attacked your charge within the last round. If you are wielding a shield, and a creature within 5 feet of you attacks your charge, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, as if you had the Protection fighting style. If you already have the Protection fighting style, then in addition to imposing disadvantage, you can also push an enemy 5 feet in any direction away from your charge when you take your reaction. You can use a bonus action on your turn to reroll the damage for any successful attack against a creature that is threatening your charge.
	Whichever version of the spell is cast, if the distance between the champion and its designated ally increases to more than 60 feet, the spell ends.

    <text>For the duration, one willing creature you touch has resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against poison. When the affected creature makes a Constitution saving throw against an effect that deals poison damage or that would cause the creature to become poisoned, the creature can choose to succeed on the saving throw. If it does so, the spell ends on the creature.
	While affected by this spell, a creature can't gain any benefit from consuming magical foodstuffs, such as those produced by the goodberry and heroes feast spells, and it doesn't suffer ill effects from consuming potentially harmful, nonmagical foodstuffs, such as spoiled food or non-potable water. The creature is affected normally by other consumable magic items, such as potions. The creature can identify poisoned food by a sour taste, with deadlier poisons tasting more sour.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>You create a magical tether of pulsing, golden force between two willing creatures you can see within range. The two creatures must be within 15 feet of each other. The tether remains as long as each tethered creature ends its turn within 15 feet of the other tethered creature. If a tethered creature ends its turn more than 15 feet away from its tethered partner, the spell ends. Though the tether appears as a thin line, its effect extends the full height of the tethered creatures and can affect prone or hovering creatures, provided the hovering creature hovers no higher than the tallest tethered creature.
	Any creature that touches the tether or ends its turn in a space the tether passes through must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. A creature that makes this saving throw, whether it succeeds or fails, can't be affected by the tether again until the start of your next turn.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the maximum distance between the tethered creatures increases by 5 feet, and the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

	While you are conscious and within the area, you are aware of the presence and direction, though not exact location, of each beast and monstrosity with an Intelligence of 3 or lower in the area. When a beast or monstrosity with an Intelligence of 3 or lower tries to leave the area, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is disoriented, uncertain of its surroundings or direction, and remains within the area for 1 hour. On a success, it leaves the area.
	When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are helped by the area's effects. All other creatures in the area are hindered by the area's effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, gives the speaker the benefits of being helped by the area's effects.
	Killing fields creates the following effects within the area.

Pack Hunters: A helped creature has advantage on attack rolls against a hindered creature if at least one helped ally is within 5 feet of the hindered creature and the helped ally isn't incapacitated.

Slaying: Once per turn, when a helped creature hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra Id6 damage of its type to a hindered creature.

Tracking: A helped creature has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks against a hindered creature.

You can create a permanent killing field by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. Structures built in the area after the killing field is permanent don't end the spell.

You transform a mirror into a magical doorway to an extradimensional realm. You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can move through the doorway into the realm beyond. For the spell's duration, the mirror remains anchored in the plane of origin, where it can't be broken or otherwise damaged by any mundane means. No creatures other than those you designate can pass through the mirror or see into the mirror realm.
	The realm within the mirror is an exact reflection of the location you left. The temperature is comfortable, and any environmental threats (lava, poisonous gas, or similar) are inert, harmless facsimiles of the real thing. Likewise, magic items reflected in the mirror realm have no magical properties, but those carried into it work normally. Food, drink, and other beneficial items within the mirror realm (reflections of originals in the real world) function as normal, real items; food can be eaten, wine can be drunk, and so on. Only items that were reflected in the mirror at the moment the spell was cast exist inside the mirror realm. Items placed in front of the mirror afterward don't appear in the mirror realm, and creatures never do unless they are allowed in by you. Items found in the mirror realm dissolve into nothingness when they leave it, but the effects of food and drink remain.
	Sound passes through the mirror in both directions. Creatures in the mirror realm can see what's happening in the world, but creatures in the world see only what the mirror reflects. Objects can cross the mirror boundary only while worn or carried by a creature, and spells can't cross it at all. You can't stand in the mirror realm and shoot arrows or cast spells at targets in the world or vice versa.
	The boundaries of the mirror realm are the same as the room or location in the plane of origin, but the mirror realm can't exceed 50,000 square feet (for simplicity, imagine 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on a side). If the original space is larger than this, such as an open field or a forest, the boundary is demarcated with an impenetrable, gray fog.
	Any creature still inside the mirror realm when the spell ends is expelled through the mirror into the nearest empty space.
	If this spell is cast in the same spot every day for a year, it becomes permanent. Once permanent, the mirror can't be moved or destroyed through mundane means. You can allow new creatures into the mirror realm (and disallow previous creatures) by recasting the spell within range of the permanent mirror. Casting the spell elsewhere doesn't affect the creation or the existence of a permanent mirror realm; a determined spellcaster could have multiple permanent mirror realms to use as storage spaces, hiding spots, and spy vantages.

By sketching a shimmering, ethereal doorway in the air and knocking three times, you call forth an otherworldly entity to provide insight or advice. The door swings open and the entity, wreathed in shadow or otherwise obscured, appears at the threshold. It answers up to five questions truthfully and to the best of its ability, but its answers aren't necessarily clear or direct. The entity can't pass through the doorway or interact with anything on your side of the doorway other than by speaking its responses.
	Likewise, creatures on your side of the doorway can't pass through it to the other side or interact with the other side in any way other than asking questions. In addition, the spell allows you and the creature to understand each other's words even if you have no language in common, the same as if you were both under the effects of the comprehend languages spell.
	When you cast this spell, you must request a specific, named entity, a specific type of creature, or a creature from a specific plane of existence. The target creature can't be native to the plane you are on when you cast the spell. After making this request, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC is 12 if you request a creature from a specific plane; I6 if you request a specific type of creature; or 20 if you request a specific entity. (The GM can choose to make this check for you secretly.) If the spellcasting check fails, the creature that responds to your summons is any entity of the GM's choosing, from any plane. No matter what, the creature is always of a type with an Intelligence of at least 8 and the ability to speak and to hear.

	Each creature within a cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the point that emitted the cone.

Each creature that enters or starts its turn within Iso feet of the affected object must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for I0 minutes. A creature charmed by this spell must take the Dash action and move toward the affected object by the safest available route on each of its turns. Once a charmed creature moves within 5 feet of the object, it is also incapacitated as it stares at the object and sways in place to a mesmerizing tune only it can hear. If the object is moved, the charmed creature attempts to follow it.
	For every 10 minutes that elapse, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on that creature.

    <text>You touch a specially prepared key to a door or gate, turning it into a one-way portal to another such door within range. This spell works with any crafted door, doorway, archway, or any other artificial opening, but not natural or accidental openings such as cave entrances or cracks in walls. You must be aware of your destination or be able to see it from where you cast the spell.
	On completing the spell, the touched door opens, revealing a shimmering image of the location beyond the destination door. You can move through the door, emerging instantly out of the destination door. You can also allow one other willing creature to pass through the portal instead. Anything you carry moves through the door with you, including other creatures, willing or unwilling.
	For the purpose of this spell, any locks, bars, or magical effects such as arcane lock are ineffectual for the spell's duration. You can travel only to a side of the door you can see or have physically visited in the past (divinations such as clairvoyance count as seeing). Once you or a willing creature passes through, both doors shut, ending the spell. If you or another creature does not move through the portal within 1 round, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases by 100 feet and the duration increases by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd. Each round added to the duration allows one additional creature to move through the portal before the spell ends.

    <text>You create a magical portal on a surface in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The portal occupies up to s square feet of the surface and is instantly covered with an illusion. The illusion looks like the surrounding terrain or surface features, such as mortared stone if the portal is placed on a stone wall, or a simple image of your choice like those created by the minor illusion spell. A creature that touches, steps on, or otherwise interacts with or enters the portal must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space up to 30 feet away in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature can't be teleported into a solid object.
	Physical interaction with the illusion reveals it to be an illusion, but such touching triggers the portal's effect. A creature that uses an action to examine the area where the portal is located can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional portal for each slot level above 2nd.

If the target was thrown vertically, it plummets to the ground, taking falling damage as normal, unless it has a flying speed or other method of preventing a fall. If the target impacts a creature, the target stops moving and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and the creature the target hits must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. After the target is thrown horizontally or it falls from being thrown vertically, regardless of whether it impacted a surface, it is knocked prone.
	As a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you can attempt to fling the same creature again. The target must succeed on another Strength saving throw or be thrown.

With a gesture and a muttered word, you cause an inky black, circular portal to open on the ground beneath one or more creatures. You can create one 15-foot-diameter portal, two 10-foot-diameter portals, or six 5-foot-diameter portals. A creature that's standing where you create a portal must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls through the portal, disappears into a demiplane where it is stunned as it falls endlessly, and the portal closes.
	At the start of your next turn, the creatures that failed their saving throws fall through matching portals directly above their previous locations. A falling creature lands prone in the space it once occupied or the nearest unoccupied space and takes falling damage as if it fell 60 feet, regardless of the distance between the exit portal and the ground. Flying and levitating creatures can't be affected by this spell.

Choose up to four creatures within range. If a target is your ally, it can reroll initiative, keeping whichever of the two results it prefers. If a target is your enemy, it must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or reroll initiative, keeping whichever of the two results you prefer. Changes to the initiative order go into effect at the start of the next round.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

On a hit, the target takes 5d8 cold damage as strands of icy nothingness whip from your outstretched hand to envelop it. If the target isn't native to the plane you're on, it takes an extra 3d6 psychic damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

The falling material's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round and comes to a stop 5 feet above the ground, where it hovers until the spell ends. This spell can't prevent missile weapons from striking a target, and it can't slow the descent of an object larger than a 10-foot cube. However, at the GM's discretion, it can slow the descent of a section of a larger object, such as the wall of a falling building or a section of sail and rigging tied to a falling mast.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cube of debris and objects you can halt increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

    <text>A 5-foot-radius immobile sphere springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. You and up to four Medium or smaller creatures can occupy the sphere. If its area includes a larger creature or more than five creatures, each larger creature and excess creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside of the sphere.
	Creatures and objects within the sphere when you cast this spell may move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through the sphere after it forms. Spells and other magical effects can't extend through the sphere, with the exception of transmutation or conjuration spells and magical effects that allow you or the creatures inside the sphere to willingly leave it, such as the dimension door and teleport spells. The atmosphere inside the sphere is cool, dry, and filled with air, regardless of the conditions outside.
	Until the effect ends, you can command the interior to be dimly lit or dark. The sphere is opaque from the outside and covered in an illusion that makes it appear as the surrounding terrain, but it is transparent from the inside. Physical interaction with the illusion reveals it to be an illusion as the creature touches the cool, firm surface of the sphere. A creature that uses an action to examine the sphere can determine it is covered by an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
	The effect ends if you leave its area, or if the sphere is hit with the disintegration spell or a successful dispel magic spell.

    <text>With a word, you create a barricade of pointed, wooden poles, also known as a cheval de frise, to block your enemies' progress. The barricade is composed of six s-foot cube barriers made of wooden spikes mounted on central, horizontal beams. Each barrier doesn't need to be contiguous with another barrier, but each barrier must appear in an unoccupied space within range.
	Each barrier is difficult terrain, and a barrier provides half cover to a creature behind it. When a creature enters a barrier's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 3d6 piercing damage.
	The barriers are objects made of wood that can be damaged and destroyed. Each barrier has AC 13, 20 hit points, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning and fire damage. Reducing a barrier to 0 hit points destroys it.
	If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the barriers become permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the barriers disappear when the spell ends.

	For the duration, you have a telepathic link with the duplicate. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the duplicate while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Run over there" or "Fetch that object." If the duplicate completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it takes the Dodge or Hide action (your choice) on its turn. The duplicate can't attack, but it can speak in a gravelly version of your voice and mimic your mannerisms with exact detail.
	As a bonus action, you can see through the duplicate's eyes and hear what it hears as if you were in the duplicate's space, gaining the benefits of the earth elemental's darkvision and tremorsense until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. As an action while sharing the duplicate's senses, you can make the duplicate explode in a shower of jagged chunks of rock, destroying the duplicate and ending the spell. Each creature within 10 feet of the duplicate must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	The duplicate explodes at the end of the duration, if you didn't cause it to explode before then. If the duplicate is killed before it explodes, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the explosion damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th. In addition, when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration is 1 hour. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. Using a spell slot of 6th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.

Bats: The creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage, and its speed is halved while within the storm as the bats cling to it and drain its blood.

Birds: The creature takes 4d6 slashing damage, and has disadvantage on attack rolls while within the storm as the birds fly in the way of the creature's attacks.

Insects: The creature takes 4d6 poison damage, and it must make a Constitution saving throw each time it casts a spell while within the storm. On a failed save, the creature fails to cast the spell, losing the action but not the spell slot.

    <text>With a growl, you call forth dozens of bears to overrun all creatures in a 20-foot cube within range. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone. The bears disappear after making their charge.

    <text>You conjure up a multitude of fey spirits that manifest as galloping horses. These horses run in a 10-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line, in a given direction starting from a point within range, trampling all creatures in their path, before vanishing again. Each creature in the line takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. A successful Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half, and the creature is not knocked prone.

On a success, the spell ends on the target.

The threshold of a doorway, the sill of a window, the junction where the floor meets the wall, the intersection of two walls—these are all points of travel for you. When you cast this spell, you can step into the junction of two surfaces, slip through the boundary of the Material Plane, and reappear in an unoccupied space with another junction you can see within 60 feet.
	You can take one willing creature of your size or smaller that you're touching with you. The target junction must have unoccupied spaces for both of you to enter when you reappear or the spell fails.

    <text>You coax a toadstool ring to sprout from the ground. A creature of your choice can sit in the center of the ring and meditate for the duration, catching glimpses of the past, present, and future. The creature can ask up to three questions: one about the past, one about the present, and one about the future. The GM offers truthful answers in the form of dreamlike visions that may be subject to interpretation. When the spell ends, the toadstools turn black and dissolve back into the earth.
	If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that the meditating creature gets a random vision unrelated to the question. The GM makes this roll in secret.

    <text>You hinder the natural attacks of a creature you can see within range. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, any time the creature attacks with a bite, claw, slam, or other weapon that isn't manufactured, it must roll the weapon's damage dice twice and use the lower total. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. This spell has no effect on constructs.

    <text>When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell ends, you can imbue a piece of ammunition you fire from a ranged weapon with a tiny, invisible beacon. If a ranged attack roll with an imbued piece of ammunition hits a target, the beacon is transferred to the target. The weapon that fired the ammunition is attuned to the beacon and becomes warm to the touch when it points in the direction of the target as long as the target is on the same plane of existence as you. You can have only one tracer target at a time. If you put a tracer on a different target, the effect on the previous target ends.
	A creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC to notice the magical beacon.

When the affected creature moves at least 10 feet straight toward a creature and attacks it, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. If the affected creature's attack hits the frightened target, the affected creature can roll the attack's damage dice twice and use the higher total.
	At the end of each of its turns, a creature frightened by this spell can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creature is no longer frightened and can't be frightened by this spell again for 24 hours.

    <text>You cause a thick carpet of vines to grow from a point on the ground within range. The vines cover objects and prone creatures within 20 feet of that point. While covered in this way, objects and creatures have total cover as long as they remain motionless. A creature that moves while beneath the carpet has only three-quarters cover from attacks on the other side of the carpet. A covered creature that stands up from prone stands atop the carpet and is no longer covered. The carpet of vines is plush enough that a Large or smaller creature can walk across it without harming or detecting those covered by it.
	When the spell ends, the vines wither away into nothingness, revealing any objects and creatures that were still covered.

	Each friendly target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier and has advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the spell ends. The temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

	For the duration, each creature that participated in the chant is filled with the fervent bloodlust of the wild hunt and gains several benefits. The creature is immune to being charmed and frightened, it deals one extra die of damage on the first weapon or spell attack it makes on each of its turns, it has advantage on Strength or Dexterity saving throws (the creature's choice), and its Armor Class increases by 1.
	When this spell ends, a creature affected by it suffers one level of exhaustion.
