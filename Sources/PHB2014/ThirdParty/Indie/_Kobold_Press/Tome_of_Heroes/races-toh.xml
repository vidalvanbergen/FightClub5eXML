      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Alseid are graceful woodland cousins to centaurs, blending the torsos of elves with the lower bodies of nimble deer. Because they rarely venture far from their wooded glades, some call them "grove nymphs," although they're more closely related to elves than nymphs.
	Alseid see the forest as an individual and a friend. They are suspicious of outsiders who do not share this view. Lost travelers who demonstrate deep respect for the forest may spot a distant alseid's white tail and chase after it as it bounces toward a road that leads out of the forest. Disrespectful strangers may follow the same tail to their doom.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Branching Crowns</name>
      <text>Alseid have antlers growing from their foreheads. Antlers grow very slowly, branching every 10 years for the first century of life (so an alseid with six points per antler should be between 60 and 70 years old). Further points only develop with the blessing of the forest. No 14-point imperial alseid are known to exist, but many tribes are governed by princes with 13 points, indicating that they've done a great service to the forest on at least three occasions. Because antlers signify status, alseid don't fight with them the way deer do. Cutting an alseid's antlers is one of the direst punishments an alseid can receive. Elf rangers sometimes report seeing lone alseid exiles, wandering the Margreve, their antlers sawn off near the scalp.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Ancient Magic and Nature's Champions</name>
      <text>Alseid have a deep connection with ancient forests and the powerful natural magic inherent in them. Alseid leaders favor the druid and ranger classes, and sorcerers and Old Wood warlocks (see the Class Options chapter) often arise from deep forest glades infused with energy.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Alseid Names</name>
      <text>Alseid name their offspring using a combination of Elvish and Sylvan syllables. Their names are often extremely long, and many alseid choose shorter nicknames for themselves when speaking with people who aren't alseid, elves, or fey. Alseid do not have family names.

Individual Names: Roanxilana (Anxi), Erymleetidoral (Erym), Sarioneldorivh (Dorivh), Thanarifaren (Anari), Levesaelynore (Salyn), Nalesariabella (Abella)</text>

      <text>Catfolk are a social and active people of natural grace and obsessive curiosity, resembling bipedal, feline humanoids with tails, cat-like ears, and fur. They are equally comfortable wandering in far-off regions, wallowing in the heart of the largest cities, or delving into the lairs of forgotten horrors. Most catfolk dwell in deserts and endless plains, but love of travel and new experiences often draw catfolk to distant realms. There are whispers of hidden catfolk communities in the deepest jungles or even far to the north in the frozen tundra.

Though catfolk can appear with the same patterns and styles as any feline, two main subraces of catfolk exist: malkin and pantheran. Malkins typically have features similar to smaller felines, such as bobcats, domestic cats, and ocelots, and they tend to live in or near cities. Pantherans typically have features similar to great cats, such as tigers, leopards, and cougars, and they tend to dwell in deep jungles or forests or in areas where grasslands meet forests.

It's often said curiosity killed the cat, and this applies with equal frequency to catfolk. As a malkin catfolk you are adept at finding clever solutions to escape difficult situations, even (or perhaps especially) situations of your own making. Your diminutive size also gives you an uncanny nimbleness that helps you avoid the worst consequences of your intense inquisitiveness. Most often found in densely populated regions, these catfolk are as curious about the comings and goings of other humanoids as they are about natural or magical phenomena and artifacts. While malkins are sometimes referred to as "housecats" by other humanoids and even by other catfolk, doing so in a malkin's hearing is a surefire way to get a face full of claws....

Pantheran catfolk are a wise, observant, and patient people who pride themselves on being resourceful and self-sufficient. Less social than many others of their kind, these catfolk typically dwell in small, close-knit family groups in the forests, jungles, and grasslands of the world, away from larger population centers or cities. Their family clans teach the importance of living off of and protecting the natural world, and pantherans act swiftly and mercilessly when their forest homes are threatened by outside forces. Conversely, pantherans can be the most fierce and loyal of neighbors to villages who respect nature and who take from the land and forest no more than they need. As a pantheran, you value nature and kinship, and your allies know they can count on your wisdom and, when necessary, your claws.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>In the lightless depths beneath the ground, an empire of devouring ambition grows and plots and dreams. Their cities lie out of sight, their agents infiltrate the underworlds of a score of surface cities, and their goals know no limits. To them, if you are not a member of their empire, you are food. Their empire maintains complex social structures and forges serious alliances. They scheme and plot. They hunger for the flesh of the living. They are the ghoulish darakhul.

Before the terrible scourge of darakhul fever transformed you into an undead creature, you belonged to another race. Although your undead self now rules you, some remnant of your past form clings to you, making you different from the darakhul created from other races. Sometimes you retain a trait, but more likely you now have a trait that is a corruption of one you once possessed. For example, the elemental spark in a dragonborn is perverted into one of a more necrotic bent. The luck inherent in a halfling's spirit twists into a power that brings ill fortune to their enemies.

For adventuring darakhul, those in self-imposed exile, or those who never belonged to a darakhul empire, the quest to master their own hunger, to transcend their role as predators of sentient beings, is as much a part of their journey as the current quest. These characters typically want to grow beyond their ghoulish appetites and regain some part of their former lives in the cultures and societies of the world's surface. No one knows better than the darakhul that they can't overcome their nature unless they confront it.
	But no matter how urbane or well-controlled the rare diplomat or merchant might seem to be, the prejudice of the living against the undead is powerful and visceral. Humanity views the darakhul with suspicion if not outright hostility, and it is difficult—but not impossible—for a darakhul to allay those fears.</text>

      <name>The Cut of Your Cloak</name>
      <text>A quality disguise is one of the best tools for a darakhul trying to make its way among the breathing. Almost all darakhul traveling on the surface maintain a disguise kit and a concealing outfit to match their cover identity. With a good costume, a darakhul might pass unchallenged among humans for a long time. Possibilities include the wrappings of a leper, enshrouding robes, veils, or the head-to-toe garb of the desert peoples. Each of these disguises requires appropriate details to help the deception withstand scrutiny: the right language skills along with knowledge of the region and its customs.
	Even a convincing disguise doesn't explain a darakhul's need to eat alone and behind closed doors. Darakhul can use cultural or religious requirements to justify such behavior in most situations. In cases where a costume and a cover identity are impractical, a skillful application of cosmetics and a few gold coins slipped into the right hands are often enough to make a request for privacy seem more reasonable. Ensuring a sufficient supply of raw meat is a challenge left to the darakhul's imagination.</text>

Your darakhul character was a derro before transforming into a darakhul. For you, the quieting of the otherworldly voices did not bring peace and tranquility. The impulses simply became more focused, and the desire to feast on flesh overwhelmed other urges. The darkness is still there; it just has a new, clearer form.

      <name>The Cut of Your Cloak</name>
      <text>A quality disguise is one of the best tools for a darakhul trying to make its way among the breathing. Almost all darakhul traveling on the surface maintain a disguise kit and a concealing outfit to match their cover identity. With a good costume, a darakhul might pass unchallenged among humans for a long time. Possibilities include the wrappings of a leper, enshrouding robes, veils, or the head-to-toe garb of the desert peoples. Each of these disguises requires appropriate details to help the deception withstand scrutiny: the right language skills along with knowledge of the region and its customs.
	Even a convincing disguise doesn't explain a darakhul's need to eat alone and behind closed doors. Darakhul can use cultural or religious requirements to justify such behavior in most situations. In cases where a costume and a cover identity are impractical, a skillful application of cosmetics and a few gold coins slipped into the right hands are often enough to make a request for privacy seem more reasonable. Ensuring a sufficient supply of raw meat is a challenge left to the darakhul's imagination.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>In the lightless depths beneath the ground, an empire of devouring ambition grows and plots and dreams. Their cities lie out of sight, their agents infiltrate the underworlds of a score of surface cities, and their goals know no limits. To them, if you are not a member of their empire, you are food. Their empire maintains complex social structures and forges serious alliances. They scheme and plot. They hunger for the flesh of the living. They are the ghoulish darakhul.

Before the terrible scourge of darakhul fever transformed you into an undead creature, you belonged to another race. Although your undead self now rules you, some remnant of your past form clings to you, making you different from the darakhul created from other races. Sometimes you retain a trait, but more likely you now have a trait that is a corruption of one you once possessed. For example, the elemental spark in a dragonborn is perverted into one of a more necrotic bent. The luck inherent in a halfling's spirit twists into a power that brings ill fortune to their enemies.

Your darakhul character was a dwarf before transforming into a darakhul. The hum of the earth, the tranquility of the stone and the dust, drained from you as the darakhul fever overwhelmed your once-resilient body. The stone is still there, but its touch has gone from a welcome embrace to a cold grip of death. But it's all the same to you now.

Your darakhul character was an elf or shadow fey (see Midgard Heroes Handbook) before transforming into a darakhul. The deathly power coursing through you reminds you of the lithe beauty and magic of your former body. If you just use your imagination, the blood tastes like wine once did. The smell of rotting flesh has the bouquet of wildflowers. The moss beneath the surface feels like the leaves of the forest.

      <name>The Cut of Your Cloak</name>
      <text>A quality disguise is one of the best tools for a darakhul trying to make its way among the breathing. Almost all darakhul traveling on the surface maintain a disguise kit and a concealing outfit to match their cover identity. With a good costume, a darakhul might pass unchallenged among humans for a long time. Possibilities include the wrappings of a leper, enshrouding robes, veils, or the head-to-toe garb of the desert peoples. Each of these disguises requires appropriate details to help the deception withstand scrutiny: the right language skills along with knowledge of the region and its customs.
	Even a convincing disguise doesn't explain a darakhul's need to eat alone and behind closed doors. Darakhul can use cultural or religious requirements to justify such behavior in most situations. In cases where a costume and a cover identity are impractical, a skillful application of cosmetics and a few gold coins slipped into the right hands are often enough to make a request for privacy seem more reasonable. Ensuring a sufficient supply of raw meat is a challenge left to the darakhul's imagination.</text>

      <text>In the lightless depths beneath the ground, an empire of devouring ambition grows and plots and dreams. Their cities lie out of sight, their agents infiltrate the underworlds of a score of surface cities, and their goals know no limits. To them, if you are not a member of their empire, you are food. Their empire maintains complex social structures and forges serious alliances. They scheme and plot. They hunger for the flesh of the living. They are the ghoulish darakhul.

Before the terrible scourge of darakhul fever transformed you into an undead creature, you belonged to another race. Although your undead self now rules you, some remnant of your past form clings to you, making you different from the darakhul created from other races. Sometimes you retain a trait, but more likely you now have a trait that is a corruption of one you once possessed. For example, the elemental spark in a dragonborn is perverted into one of a more necrotic bent. The luck inherent in a halfling's spirit twists into a power that brings ill fortune to their enemies.

Your darakhul character was a halfling before transforming into a darakhul. Everything you loved as a halfling—food, drink, exploration, adventure—still drives you in your undead form; it is simplya more ghoulish form of those pleasures now: raw flesh instead of stew, warm blood instead of cold mead. You still want to explore the dark corners of the world, but now you seek something different.

      <name>Into the Big, Wide, World</name>
      <text>Some darakhul venture into the wider world on the business of their empire. Maintaining their state requires envoys and ambassadors, messengers and scouts, traders and commerce, as well as knowledge of events in the surface world. These undead diplomats engage with races they might otherwise consider food out of duty to the empire and with a specific purpose.
	Other members of their kind, however, have no such obligations. For adventuring darakhul, those in self-imposed exile, or those who never belonged to a darakhul empire, the quest to master their own hunger, to transcend their role as predators of sentient beings, is as much a part of their journey as the current quest. These characters typically want to grow beyond their ghoulish appetites and regain some part of their former lives in the cultures and societies of the world's surface. No one knows better than the darakhul that they can't overcome their nature unless they confront it.
	But no matter how urbane or well-controlled the rare diplomat or merchant might seem to be, the prejudice of the living against the undead is powerful and visceral. Humanity views the darakhul with suspicion if not outright hostility, and it is difficult—but not impossible—for a darakhul to allay those fears.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>The Cut of Your Cloak</name>
      <text>A quality disguise is one of the best tools for a darakhul trying to make its way among the breathing. Almost all darakhul traveling on the surface maintain a disguise kit and a concealing outfit to match their cover identity. With a good costume, a darakhul might pass unchallenged among humans for a long time. Possibilities include the wrappings of a leper, enshrouding robes, veils, or the head-to-toe garb of the desert peoples. Each of these disguises requires appropriate details to help the deception withstand scrutiny: the right language skills along with knowledge of the region and its customs.
	Even a convincing disguise doesn't explain a darakhul's need to eat alone and behind closed doors. Darakhul can use cultural or religious requirements to justify such behavior in most situations. In cases where a costume and a cover identity are impractical, a skillful application of cosmetics and a few gold coins slipped into the right hands are often enough to make a request for privacy seem more reasonable. Ensuring a sufficient supply of raw meat is a challenge left to the darakhul's imagination.</text>

      <name>Darakhul Characters</name>
      <text>Both ordinary ghouls and darakhul arise from the infected corpses of other races. Most traits of the previous race are gone when the creature rises as a darakhul, although each darakhul carries some traits of their previous form (see the Heritage Subraces). Still, most of a darakhul's cosmetic features, such as supple skin or a long beard, fade over time into the gaunt, skull-like face, fanged maw, and taut, gray skin of a ghoulish undead.</text>

      <name>Imperfect Undeath</name>
      <text>You transitioned into undeath, but your transition was imperfect. Though you are a humanoid, you are susceptible to effects that target undead. You can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds, but you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target undead, such as a cleric's Turn Undead feature. Game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, but they return you to life as a darakhul. A true resurrection or wish spell can restore you to life as a fully living member of your original race.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>In the lightless depths beneath the ground, an empire of devouring ambition grows and plots and dreams. Their cities lie out of sight, their agents infiltrate the underworlds of a score of surface cities, and their goals know no limits. To them, if you are not a member of their empire, you are food. Their empire maintains complex social structures and forges serious alliances. They scheme and plot. They hunger for the flesh of the living. They are the ghoulish darakhul.

Before the terrible scourge of darakhul fever transformed you into an undead creature, you belonged to another race. Although your undead self now rules you, some remnant of your past form clings to you, making you different from the darakhul created from other races. Sometimes you retain a trait, but more likely you now have a trait that is a corruption of one you once possessed. For example, the elemental spark in a dragonborn is perverted into one of a more necrotic bent. The luck inherent in a halfling's spirit twists into a power that brings ill fortune to their enemies.

Your darakhul character was a ravenfolk before transforming into a darakhul. Your new form feels different. It is more powerful and less fidgety, and your beak has become razor sharp. There is still room for trickery, of course. But with your new life comes a disconnection from the All Father. Does this loss gnaw at you like your new hunger or do you feel freed from the destiny of your people?

Your darakhul character was a trollkin (see Midgard Heroes Handbook) before transforming into a darakhul. Others saw you as a monster because of your ancestry. You became inured to the fearful looks and hurried exits of those around you. If only they could see you now. Does your new state make you seek revenge on them, or are you able to maintain your self-control despite the new urges you feel?

	But no matter how urbane or well-controlled the rare diplomat or merchant might seem to be, the prejudice of the living against the undead is powerful and visceral. Humanity views the darakhul with suspicion if not outright hostility, and it is difficult—but not impossible—for a darakhul to allay those fears.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>The Cut of Your Cloak</name>
      <text>A quality disguise is one of the best tools for a darakhul trying to make its way among the breathing. Almost all darakhul traveling on the surface maintain a disguise kit and a concealing outfit to match their cover identity. With a good costume, a darakhul might pass unchallenged among humans for a long time. Possibilities include the wrappings of a leper, enshrouding robes, veils, or the head-to-toe garb of the desert peoples. Each of these disguises requires appropriate details to help the deception withstand scrutiny: the right language skills along with knowledge of the region and its customs.
	Even a convincing disguise doesn't explain a darakhul's need to eat alone and behind closed doors. Darakhul can use cultural or religious requirements to justify such behavior in most situations. In cases where a costume and a cover identity are impractical, a skillful application of cosmetics and a few gold coins slipped into the right hands are often enough to make a request for privacy seem more reasonable. Ensuring a sufficient supply of raw meat is a challenge left to the darakhul's imagination.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Darakhul Characters</name>
      <text>Both ordinary ghouls and darakhul arise from the infected corpses of other races. Most traits of the previous race are gone when the creature rises as a darakhul, although each darakhul carries some traits of their previous form (see the Heritage Subraces). Still, most of a darakhul's cosmetic features, such as supple skin or a long beard, fade over time into the gaunt, skull-like face, fanged maw, and taut, gray skin of a ghoulish undead.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Ability Score Increase</name>
      <text>Your Constitution score increases by 1, and your Strength score increases by 2.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Age</name>
      <text>An upper limit of darakhul age has never been discovered; most darakhul die violently.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Your alignment does not change when you become a darakhul, but most darakhul have a strong draw toward evil.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Size</name>
      <text>Trollkin stand over 6 feet tall and are more solidly built than humans, weighing around 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Speed</name>
      <text>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Darkvision</name>
      <text>You can see in dim light within 60 feet as though it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Hunger for Flesh</name>
      <text>You must consume I pound of raw meat each day or suffer the effects of starvation. If you go 24 hours without such a meal, you gain one level of exhaustion. While you have any levels of exhaustion from this trait, you can't regain hit points or remove levels of exhaustion until you spend at least 1 hour consuming 10 pounds of raw meat.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Imperfect Undeath</name>
      <text>You transitioned into undeath, but your transition was imperfect. Though you are a humanoid, you are susceptible to effects that target undead. You can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds, but you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target undead, such as a cleric's Turn Undead feature. Game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, but they return you to life as a darakhul. A true resurrection or wish spell can restore you to life as a fully living member of your original race.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Powerful Jaw</name>
      <text>Your heavy jaw is powerful enough to crush bones to powder. Your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</text>
      <roll description="Unarmed Piercing Damage">1d4+%1</roll>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Sunlight Sensitivity</name>
      <text>You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Undead Resilience</name>
      <text>You are infused with the dark energy of undeath, which frees you from some frailties that plague most creatures. You have resistance to necrotic damage and poison damage, you are immune to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or poisoned. When you finish a short rest, you can reduce your exhaustion level by 1, provided you have ingested at least I pound of raw meat in the last 24 hours (see Hunger for Flesh).</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Undead Vitality</name>
      <text>You don't need to breathe, and you don't sleep the way most creatures do. Instead, you enter a dormant state that resembles death, remaining semiconscious, for 6 hours a day. While dormant, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="subspecies">
      <name>Regenerative Bite</name>
      <text>The regenerative powers of your trollkin heritage are less potent than they were in life and need a little help. As an action, you can make a bite attack against a creature that isn't undead or a construct. On a hit, you regain hit points (minimum of 1) equal to half the amount of damage dealt. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Languages</name>
      <text>You can speak, read, and write Common, Darakhul, and Trollkin.</text>

The drow regard them with a strange type of favor, almost like dim-witted children. The aboleths and duergar have historically used and abused the derro. The derro know no actual friends, but they are overawed by power and dominance. They serve beings whose assumed superiority impresses them, and, when led in this way, their insanity clears enough to keep them moving toward the leader's goals.

      <name>Culture and Rule</name>
      <text>Love, as other races know it, is unheard of in the bizarre core family unit of the derro. Derro children are born sane, but they are deliberately driven mad by their relatives, usually by age four. Parents feed, clothe, and protect their children not out of a sense of love or tenderness, but because they know that every derro awakened to the mind-bending truth of their race brings them glory. The horrific rituals that break a young derro's sanity vary by tribe and even year to year. Details are sparse, but known ritual names include Staring into the Void, Enduring the Heartless Fire, and the First Drink of True Knowledge.
	Derro are paranoid, unstable, and jittery, and many suffer powerful delusions of grandeur as well. Madness compels them to commit acts of cruelty against their companions or pets, and these acts ignite constant infighting among them. A few, however, muster enough restraint and control to keep the entirety of derro society from crumbling.
	Savants are powerful sorcerers who hold their madness at bay long enough to cobble together coherent plans, though even they are dangerously unpredictable. The derro's antipaladins are terrifying engines of crazed destruction who have looked deep into the void between stars and survived-and even the savants respect them for that. Clans that stick together long enough inadvertently create a witch queen among their ranks, a collective spirit of the clan. These derro become the leaders and central focuses of their clans, driving the clan to inscrutable ends. When one witch queen dies, her spirit transfers to another derro in the clan, transforming that derro into the next witch queen and perpetuating the clan.</text>

      <name>Gods of the Derro</name>
      <text>The derro worship a horde of bizarre and terrible beings, including demon lords. Perhaps the most disturbing of their deities are the Great Old Ones whose mere symbolic presence melts minds and corrupts the world. Derro worshipers venerate Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods, in particular. There is no pattern or reason that governs which dark being will catch a given derro's fancy, and devotees are violently hostile to worshipers of other entities.
	Derro consider themselves the most exalted servants of the blasphemous figures they venerate; the only beings in the entire multiverse who can truly understand their deity's glory. Specific rituals vary from cult to cult, but the unifying thread of derro faith asserts that their racial madness is a gift that makes communion with these deities possible. Further, the derro believe they are the harbingers of the end of time and that they alone will inherit the shattered husk of creation.</text>

This tentacle has a reach of 5 feet and can lift a number of pounds equal to double your Strength score. The tentacle can't wield weapons or shields or perform tasks that require manual precision, such as performing the somatic components of a spell, but it can perform simple tasks, such as opening an unlocked door or container, stowing or retrieving an object, or pouring the contents out of a vial.

	• Tainted Blood. Your blood is tainted by your connection with otherworldly entities. When you take piercing or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to force your blood to spray out of the wound. You and each creature within 5 feet of you take necrotic damage equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Deep beneath the earth, the derro wait in twisted cities built by their mad architects. These insane humanoids live, work, and somehow thrive in the lightless depths. They understand the truth about the uncaring gods that dwell between the stars, and they abandoned sanity long ago to save themselves. The derro hide within their insanity in the hope that the dark gods they fear will turn that sinister attention to other, saner races first.
	Despite the great distances between their underground cities and the surface, derro outposts can be found in the slums of many cities, both above and below ground. Occasionally, a derro discovers the wider world and finds a path out of the madness.

Derro differ based on their location within derro communities, their clan's connections to the dark powers that sculpt and manipulate the derro race, and the manifestations of the changes their otherworldly patrons bestow on them. Most derro dwell happily and deeply in their culture-induced insanity for their entire existence, others escape the madness-inducing indoctrination, and others still go straight through the madness toward powers beyond what derro usually enjoy.

Someone in your past failed to do their job of driving you to the brink of insanity. It might have been a doting parent that decided to buck tradition. It might have been a touched seer who had visions of your future without the connections to the mad gods your people serve. It might have been a whole outcast community of derro rebels who refused to serve the madness of your ancestors. Whatever happened in your past, you are quite sane—or at least quite sane for a derro.

      <text>The derro are stunted, dwarflike humanoids, small of stature with wide shoulders and stubby limbs.

Their pale skin is nearly translucent, revealing a ghostly web of blue veins. Their large, pure white staring eyes gleam in the dark.

      <text>The true history of the derro is an incomprehensible tangle. The entire race embraced insanity long ago.

The various cults and clans of the derro embrace a wide variety of myths, mostly passed along by oral tradition and mind-bending artwork. Every new teller of a given tale twists or rewrites portions of the story to fit their own warped view of the world.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The denizens of the surface world did not know of the existence of the drow until recently in the world's history. Even other creatures who lived beneath the surface only heard of the race through rumors and half-mythical stories. The magnificent cities and structures created by the drow were viewed by very few outsiders, as the locales were kept secret, protected by traps, magic, and a network of fortifications and soldiers. With the rise of the darakhul and their empires, however, the drow civilization is now exposed to the rest of the world and on the brink of annihilation.

The drow are generally born into different castes, which determines what is expected of them in drow society. The delvers are the workers who maintain the (once) magnificent drow cities, serve in the drow military, and keep the rest of the drow safe and fed. The purified make up the leaders, skilled laborers, and magic-users of the drow. With the war between the drow and the darakhul going so poorly, a new and growing population of drow, called the fever-bit, have been infected with darakhul fever and survived, changing them into something quite new-and potentially powerful.

You were once a typical drow, then you fell victim to the ravaging claws and teeth of a darakhul. The deadly darakhul fever almost took your life, but, when you were on the verge of succumbing, you rallied and survived. You were changed, however, in ways that even the greatest healers of your people can't fathom. But now that you are immune to darakhul fever, your commanders have a job for you.

      <text>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs-these common threads unite all dwarves.

Dwarven legends state the best metal-crafting is done in the fires of the earth itself. Long ago, some clans that followed this tradition sought out and settled near areas of volcanic activity, turning such places into their forges. These dwarves became the fireforge dwarves. They toil in the heat of magma, creating weapons, armor, and other goods noteworthy even among fine dwarven crafts. They trade these goods for necessities not found in the harsh environs of their chosen homeland.
	Fireforge dwarves sometimes form alliances with the azer. They maintain good relations with the elementals, coming to their aid against salamanders and efreet when needed. In return, the azer assist fireforge dwarves against fire giants, who are persistent enemies of the dwarves, often competing with them for territory.
	Fireforge skin tones range from deep, ruddy browns to dark bronze or mahogany. Their hair is typically black, brown, or gray, with some sporting deep, copper-colored or rich, dark-red hair. Eye color tends toward brown or black and occasionally hazel or gray.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Short and Stout</name>
      <text>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.
	Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.
	Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Long Memory, Long Grudges</name>
      <text>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.
	Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
	Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Clans and Kingdoms</name>
      <text>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.
	The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
	Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</text>

      <text>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure-for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Slow to Trust</name>
      <text>Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. "The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years," is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.

Elves: "It's not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc's head, they're as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They're flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don't have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf's good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do."

Halflings: "Sure, they're pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?"

Humans: "You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human's on her deathbed. If you're lucky, she's got kin-a daughter or granddaughter, maybe-who's got hands and heart as good as hers. That's when you can make a human friend. And watch them go!. They set their hearts on something, they'll get it whether it's a dragon's hoard or an empire's throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not."</text>

      <text>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs-these common threads unite all dwarves.

While most dwarves ensconce themselves in the earth, spindrift dwarves have a bond with the ocean, and many spend most of their lives at sea. They tend to be slightly taller and slimmer than their landlubber cousins. Their hair and beards are lightened by exposure to sun and salt, often tied or braided against the wind. Many are comfortable barefoot and typically wear loose clothing that doesn't hinder their work.
	Spindrift dwarves settle on islands and mainland coasts, always in areas with natural harbors. Certain clans rarely come ashore at all, spending their lives on ships at sea, coming into port only when necessity dictates. There are even stories of spindrift dwarves that live on artificial islands made of ships lashed together-both seaworthy and not—along with other bits of flotsam and jetsam.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Short and Stout</name>
      <text>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.
	Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.
	Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Long Memory, Long Grudges</name>
      <text>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.
	Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
	Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Clans and Kingdoms</name>
      <text>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.
	The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
	Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</text>

      <text>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

The desert-dwelling dunewalker elves match other elves in height and weight. Their coloration is typically darker, ranging from warm tawny and golden shades to deep sepia tones. Their eyes are amber, brown, or black. Dunewalker elf hair usually comes in shades of brown or black, though some have hair of a dark auburn or copper color.
	Dunewalker elves are canny survivors and hunters, aware of the precious resources and dire dangers of their harsh lands. They step lightly across the sands and seem to simply vanish right before one's eyes, as if they were nothing more than a mirage conjured by the heat.

You are adapted to life in deserts and badlands, and your innate magic allows you to create a minor mirage around yourself.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Slender and Graceful</name>
      <text>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.
	Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>A Timeless Perspective</name>
      <text>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.
	Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hidden Woodland Realms</name>
      <text>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees.

They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).
	Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</text>

      <text>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

These reclusive elves live in high mountainous or arctic regions, areas that are deep with snow through most of the year or locked in permafrost. They are tenacious survivors, accustomed to living off the land and surviving on the slim bounty of their cold home.
	Frostfell elves have ivory skin, often tinted blue in varying degrees. Hair color is usually stark white or pale blonde, though about one in ten have hair that is a deep blue-black in color. They commonly have eyes of blue or green, ranging from pale shades that appear almost white to deep, rich hues.

You are adapted to the frozen reaches of the world and have learned to shape the ice and snow around you into useful tools.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Slender and Graceful</name>
      <text>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.
	Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>A Timeless Perspective</name>
      <text>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.
	Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Hidden Woodland Realms</name>
      <text>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).
	Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Exploration and Adventure</name>
      <text>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Frostfell Elf Names</name>
      <text>Frostfell elves have naming conventions similar to their cousins in warmer climes, but their family names tend to praise specific areas, creatures, or plants of their homeland.

Male Names: Daerlam, Kantil, Lyemar, Rehar, Theram, Zarithar

Female Names: Elonal, Ilaryl, Nimvanna, Saelque, Tahleiress, Verathisel

Family Names: Lyathuhar (Wolf's Wisdom), Narilathal (Ancient Healing Gift), Nimaselern (Deep Mountain Winter), Rumselaith (High Meadow Home), Shalaera'ro (Song of the Summer Sun), Vonoro (Iceflower)</text>

      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.</text>

      <name>Trance</name>
      <text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.</text>

If the ambient temperature is warmer than freezing, the object lasts 1 minute. As long as the ambient temperature remains at freezing or colder, the object lasts for 24 hours or until destroyed.

      <text>The enigmatic hedgehog-folk trace their history back to the beginning of the world—further back than even elves can trace—to the first groves and wild grasslands, to those green places between the elemental poles that birthed all that is. Or so the erina druids like to claim.
	The erina are a small-statured race of creatures resembling bipedal hedgehogs. They often escape the notice of the powerful rulers of the land, though anyone traveling through the wilds would do well to have them as allies.

    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Curious</name>
      <text>Erina are a highly intelligent species whose natural curiosity and cunning serve them well. They are always probing around the limits of their territory and keep a careful record of their environment. Erina seem supernaturally aware of their surroundings and have a keen eye for things that are out of place or novel.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Scroungers</name>
      <text>Erina subsist by scrounging. In the wild, their diet consists of fruit, roots, insects, and small animals that come within range of their spears. The few erina who make their homes in cities live in much the same way. For this reason, erina sometimes run afoul of the law, though they are not naturally greedy.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Defenders of Hearth and Home</name>
      <text>The erina generally worship deities focused on the hearth and home. The tenets of such deities regarding defense of home align very well with the erina's territorial nature. The burrows of the erina contain a dizzying number of tunnels and chambers with multiple camouflaged entrances and exits. Invading an erina burrow is a nightmarish experience, as the little defenders burrow over, under, and beside their enemies with alarming speed, striking from a freshly dug hole before retreating to safety.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Erina Abroad</name>
      <text>Erina tend to live in large communities of their own kind. Occasionally, compatible fey creatures may lair near or even within an erina burrow. On occasion, some erina are so overcome with curiosity that they leave their homes to investigate the world beyond. These adventurous erina make excellent rangers and druids, exploring the unknown wilderness with a grin and a twitching nose.
	Other times, if there is a great threat to the region where the erina have dug their burrows, the defenders of the colony embark on a mission to face the danger nose-on. On rare occasions, some erina may find their actions warrant expulsion from the burrow. Erina communities are often suspicious of warlocks and sorcerers, and members of the colony who make bargains with strange entities or who exhibit dangerous connections to powerful magic are often escorted out of the burrow.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Erina Language</name>
      <text>Erina speak their own language, a series of whirring sounds punctuated by clicks. Erina can also communicate with other erina using only twitches of the nose and whiskers, though this old nonverbal language has fallen out of fashion in recent generations. Most burrows have at least one member who speaks the Common tongue.</text>

The original dwarven gearforged engineers valued function over form, eschewing aesthetics in favor of instilling their chassis with toughness and strength. The chassis' metal face is clearly crafted to look dwarven, but its countenance is entirely unactuated and forged of a dark metal—often brass—sometimes with a lighter-colored mane of hair and a braided beard and mustaches made of fine metal strands. The gearforged's eyes glow a dark turquoise, staring dispassionately with a seemingly blank expression. Armor and helms worn by the gearforged are often styled to appear as if they were integrated into its chassis, making it all-but-impossible to tell where the armor ends and the gearforged begins.

      <text>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe, and you don't sleep the way most creatures do. Instead, you enter a dormant state where you resemble a statue and remain semiconscious for 6 hours a day. During this time, the magic in your soul gem and everwound springs slowly repairs the day's damage to your mechanical body. While in this dormant state, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</text>

      <name>Living Construct</name>
      <text>Your consciousness and soul reside within a soul gem to animate your mechanical body. As such, you are a living creature with some of the benefits and drawbacks of a construct. Though you can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds, you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target constructs, such as the shatter spell. As long as your soul gem remains intact, game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, repairing the damaged pieces of your mechanical body (restoring lost sections only if the spell normally restores lost limbs) and returning you to life as a gearforged. Alternatively, if your body is destroyed but your soul gem and memory gears are intact, they can be installed into a new body with a ritual that takes one day and 10,000 gp worth of materials. If your soul gem is destroyed, only a wish spell can restore you to life, and you return as a fully living member of your original race.</text>

      <text>Every dwarf knows that it's better to leave home without pants than without your weapon. Choose a weapon with which you are proficient and that doesn't have the two-handed property. You can integrate this weapon into one of your arms. While the weapon is integrated, you can't be disarmed of it by any means, though you can use an action to remove the weapon. You can draw or sheathe the weapon as normal, the weapon folding into or springing from your arm instead of a sheath. While the integrated weapon is drawn in this way, it is considered held in that arm's hand, which can't be used for other actions such as casting spells. You can integrate a new weapon or replace an integrated weapon as part of a short or long rest. You can have up to two weapons integrated at a time, one per arm.

      <text>Originally created as powerful soldiers, gearforged must now find their own paths to navigate the second life they've been given. Many devote themselves to civil service, others to their gods. Some dedicate their extraordinarily long lives to the pursuit of knowledge. A few, naturally, seek out lives of adventure.
	The gearforged are an artificial race. More importantly, its members are created one at a time and come from a vast array of backgrounds. Nevertheless, they maintain rich traditions of history, culture, and spirituality all their own.

Four races mastered the creation of gearforged and build gearforged in their likenesses to house the souls of their people. The vast majority of gearforged have human chassis, as humans pioneered the technology and created the first gearforged, but dwarves, gnomes, and kobolds have since expanded on the technology. Each has discovered ways of incorporating unique features of their people into the frames and magic of the gearforged. You started life as a dwarf, gnome, human, or kobold, and when your physical body died, your consciousness and soul were transferred into a soul gem and mounted in a gearforged body.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Form and Function</name>
      <text>All gearforged were once other creatures with flesh-and-blood bodies, but their conscious minds were transplanted into articulated bodies of iron, steel, brass, and wood, driven by pistons and springs. Each is as distinctive in appearance as other people are. Some entities spend a fortune on these new bodies, while others scrape together anything that will work-especially if the subject is aging or ill.
	All gearforged are made in humanoid shape, often in the likeness of the person's original race. The vast majority of gearforged are created from and shaped like humans, who were the first creators of gearforged. Gearforged have articulated joints, hands, feet, and crystal-lens eyes.
	Gearforged mechanisms are more than mechanical, because gearforged are machines with souls. Their arms and legs are driven by everwound springs. Their minds are actuated by memory gears, transverse cognition gearing, and the marvel of a soul gem connected directly to a maze of silver and mithral steam, spark, and magical conduits. These elements reside in a shell of iron, brass, and steel.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Gearforged Components</name>
      <text>The range of gearforged anatomy in all its variants is remarkable, but all gearforged share some common parts.

Everwound Springs. These magical springs provide energy over long periods, effectively acting as the power sources for most of the gearforged's moving parts. A broken everwound spring results in the loss of function in that digit or limb, much like a damaged joint or ligaments in a flesh-and-blood creature.

Soul Gem. The mind of a gearforged creature is as sharp as that of any flesh-and-blood soul, but it is more portable. The animating, vital principle of a gearforged—its will, its personality, its mind—are retained in a soul gem. The destruction of this gem means the death of that gearforged.

Memory Gears. These delicate constructions are scroll-like ribbons pierced with thousands of pin holes and wound about with tiny enchantments of great complexity. The memory of a gearforged for all the days after its creation lives in the memory gears. Older gearforged have many such gears, and the material component for the magic to create them requires one new gear for every 1o years of life. Installing a new memory gear requires one day's work and 2,000 gp.
	Other gearforged can read memory gears salvaged from a dead gearforged, but it's a complex, time-consuming process. It's also viewed with some alarm by most gearforged, since it is akin to peering into the most private details of a creature's life. When a used memory gear is installed in a new or existing gearforged, the process takes three days' work to avoid damaging the memories in the gear, and it takes one week before the recipient can fully interpret and understand the memories.</text>

Kobolds are naturally curious tinkerers, constantly modifying their devices and tools. As such, kobolds, in spite of what many dwarf or gnome engineers might say, were the second race to master the nuances of gearforged creation after studying human gearforged. However, most of these early kobold gearforged no longer exist, as the more draconic forms (homages to the kobolds' draconic masters) proved too alien to the kobold soul gems to maintain stable, long-term connections with the bodies. Kobold engineers have since resolved that problem, and kobold gearforged can be found among many kobold communities, aiding its members and tinkering right alongside their scale-and-blood brethren.

As long as your soul gem remains intact, game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, repairing the damaged pieces of your mechanical body (restoring lost sections only if the spell normally restores lost limbs) and returning you to life as a gearforged. Alternatively, if your body is destroyed but your soul gem and memory gears are intact, they can be installed into a new body with a ritual that takes one day and 10,000 gp worth of materials. If your soul gem is destroyed, only a wish spell can restore you to life, and you return as a fully living member of your original race.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

This amphibious race of gnomes tends to live in temperate and warm coastal waters, often in or near coral reefs. Hair and eye colors tend to be various shades of green or brown. A shoal gnome's skin tends towards standard gnomish shades, but with the addition of mottled patches or spots of color along their arms, legs, necks, foreheads, and cheeks. These patterns are a blend of reds, pinks, yellows, silvers, and blues, with the predominance of color and type of pattern varying by region. Their long fingers and toes are webbed.
	Shoal gnomes often form relationships with the animals that share their homes in the shallows, and they are especially fond of sea turtles and dolphins. They enjoy all forms of games and contests of skill, from hide-and-seek, to riddle contests, to races. Some attach harnesses to sea turtles, using the creatures to pull them along as they race to see who can circumnavigate their reef home first.

      <text>A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.
	A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.</text>

      <name>Delighted Dedication</name>
      <text>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see.
	Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.
	Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they're just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkerers, and inventors. They're willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.</text>

Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.
	Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkerers.

Wyrd gnomes are born from natural, genetic mutations in populations of other gnomes. Wyrd gnomes possess physical traits typical to the type of gnomes to which they are born, but they are born with two different colored eyes: the right one always blue, the left one always green. Wyrd gnomes possess an innate prescient ability that grows stronger in proximity to other wyrd gnomes. Some gnome communities find their powers a blessing while others find it disturbing. Over generations, wyrd gnomes have gathered together in small communities of their own kind. However, wyrd gnomes don't always birth more wyrd gnomes, and their communities and families have gnomes of other varieties within them.
	Given the collective prescient power of wyrd gnome communities, they can be fascinating places to visit. Travelers may enter an inn to find the food and drink they wished to order already in place on a table. Conversations may start with wyrd gnomes giving answers before the questions are asked.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
	Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

No creature epitomizes the art of graceful service like the courtfolk, an accomplishment these halflings take with great (but quiet) pride. Courtfolk are defined by their dedication and deference to great courts, particularly elven courts. Their complexion is usually pale and freckled with light-colored eyes and curly mops of hair. They prefer neat, well-tailored clothing with touches of courtly inspiration without ever descending into gaudy imitation. Colors are pastel or forest tones and muted, befitting a servant, but never drab. Courtfolk are not motivated by material wealth or luxury, finding genuine contentment in simple things, but what they do keep, they desire to be of fine quality. They take pains to care for their clothing, family heirlooms, musical instruments, work implements, and other valued possessions.
	Courtfolk maintain servitude was never forced upon them but freely chosen, even though many courtfolk no longer serve. This belief, true or not, gives them a sense of agency and relevance to their servitude. The profound delight the courtfolk derive from being of service to others and in performing a job well stems from knowing they have controlled their destiny. Service is an honor to the courtfolk, and service comes to them out of compassion rather than fear or awe (although certainly individual courtfolk may come to fear or worship their masters based on treatment).
	The courtfolk adventurer is a courtfolk who no longer serves or whose family no longer serves. Such adventurers tend to be motivated by one of two things: loyalty to an ally or generating money to look after their families. A courtfolk is a dauntless ally and comrade-in-arms and never aims to steal the credit for their friends' derring-do. Their loyalty and practicality make them faithful companions in the heart of a dungeon as much as an intrigue-steeped noble court.

You are a halfling raised in a life of service or raised by parents who spent a life in service. Though you no longer serve another, you inherited some magical talents from your family's ancestral patrons.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Small and Practical</name>
      <text>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.
	Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.
	Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</text>

Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.

They typically don't recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.
	Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings' hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</text>

      <text>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
	Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

These canny wilderness dwellers eschew the comforts of civilization their cousins love so well. They have become adept ambush hunters and pack hunters and are fiercely protective of their homeland. They are suspicious of outsiders and usually opt to drive intruders away with a sudden show of force, resorting to repeated hit-and-run skirmishes to get the point across should interlopers persist in trespassing. Hinterfolk are a pragmatic people, doing whatever is necessary to protect their clans and territory. Some clans build their homes in the treetops, using ropes and ladders to traverse between buildings and to and from the ground. Others dig subterranean homes with entrances among the tree roots, providing cool, comfortable hidden homes inaccessible to most local predators.
	Hinterfolk are taller and rangier than their more civilized cousins, with more long, lean muscle mass. Their hair is either shaved or worn in long, knotted locks or braids with colors ranging black, brown, and dark auburn. Skin tones range mostly from light brown to deep tan, often decorated with tattoos or ritual scarring, which symbolize notable achievements, victories in combat, and other accomplishments the clan admires.

You are a halfling raised far from civilization and adapted to life in the wilderness.

      <name>Small and Practical</name>
      <text>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.
	Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.
	Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</text>

	Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

From ramshackle, patchwork barges to the decks of fishing boats and smuggling vessels, riverfolk halflings are found along the greatest rivers of the world. The gruff barge pilot in the wide-brimmed hat, predicting a river with near-prescient skill; the singer, stamping out rhythms on the deck while belting out bawdy songs; the charming huckster, swindling the big folk out of their savings for promises and trinkets with a gleam in his eye—all different but all riverfolk and all making their sometimes-contentious homes wherever the current takes them. They have dark coloring all around, various shades of woody browns from hair to eyes to skin. Men and women dress similarly in practical, working clothing, mostly tough canvas or leather shirts and pants, and favor hefty, good-quality work gloves. Most riverfolk don some type of hat, from floppy, wide-brimmed hats to caps bearing jaunty duck feathers.
	Riverfolk love matching strength and wits against the big folk-and against each other too, if the drinks are flowing. Their favorite competitive game is barrel walking along their decks or on the piers, a display of physical prowess. Riverfolk excel at it, and they're glad to show off to romantic interests or challenge others.
	The dream of many young riverfolk is to own their own river barge one day, whether freshly built or pieced together from scrap and determination. Riverfolk spend their lives working hard on docks, boats, and barges. They are fishermen, warehouse workers, shipwrights, carpenters, smugglers, hucksters, pilots, and more, almost all of them eking out livings from the river or adjacent to it. A smattering of riverfolk can be found making a go at other professions inland, but the reasoning for sticking to the rivers is simple: they're good at it and enjoy it.

You are a halfling who grew up on docks, fishing boats, or a patchwork of river barges, and you are more at home on a temperamental river than on solid ground.

      <name>Riverfolk Names</name>
      <text>Riverfolk are an independent lot and often jostled about among other races. Because of this, riverfolk names give way to nicknames quickly, a means of maintaining some control in the world—big folk rarely get the satisfaction of knowing their true names. Family names evoke a mix of natural themes and boat life and are combined elements from both parents. For example, if Margo Whitebottle and Rennie Halfknot have a son, they might name him Lothaire Halfbottle, nicknamed "Louie."

	Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

Having originally lost their rural residences due to flood, famine, war, or other great misfortune, some clans of halflings migrated to large urban areas long ago, making homes for themselves within the metropolitan areas of other races. Most urban halflings are insular and unobtrusive, working quietly within their own communities and staying out of the way of other races. Extended families will often band together, working a communal business and sharing the profits among themselves.
	Urban halflings share the same physical features as their lightfoot kin. However, they tend to adopt the fashion trends most common within the city in which they live to better blend in with the populace. This adaptation also extends to the wearing of whatever footwear is common and even taking on the hairstyles most seen in the region.

You are a halfling adapted to life in urban centers, particularly in large cities.

      <text>You grew up learning a second, secret language shared by your people. The cant is a halfling-based creole mixed with Common and select words taken from other languages, using specific dialects and jargon. This language is never taught to outsiders and is used by urban halflings to communicate directly to one another for privacy and protection.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
	Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

The origins of the winterfolk are shrouded in mystery. Sightings of them are so rare in most parts of the world that some doubt they exist at all. Despite their scarcity, the winterfolk do exist. They dwell in the northernmost parts of the world or in the foothills of the coldest mountains. Before the fall of their kingdom, they lived in comfortable huts and burrows in the hills. When giants sacked the kingdom, the winterfolk were driven from their homes into the rugged wilds.
	Winterfolk burrow their sod-roofed homes into the windswept and craggy foothills of alpine regions, where they hunt and trap creatures much larger and fiercer than themselves among the frigid lakes and snow-blanketed evergreen forests. Their homes are devoid of comforts, befitting a people that has come to almost relish hardship. When their lives become too comfortable, winterfolk begin to fear they have upset their ancestors and the land. They seek out challenges with a zeal that often appears suicidal to others.
	Winterfolk are highly superstitious and rarely let their guard down because a lapse in attention can spell doom for themselves or their community. They invoke ancient runes and sigils for protection and sing droning songs to ancient gods of the sky, the hills, and the forest. Pound for pound, winterfolk halflings are as tough as any dwarf or orc. While they don't despise their softer cousins, they do view other halflings with a reserved pity.

Your people are cunning survivors who revere the old gods of the world and are at home in hardship.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Small and Practical</name>
      <text>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.
	Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.
	Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Kind and Curious</name>
      <text>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.
	Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Blend into the Crowd</name>
      <text>Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid unwanted attention.
	Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.</text>

      <name>Pastoral Pleasantries</name>
      <text>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don't recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.
	Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings' hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</text>

      <name>Minotaur Names</name>
      <text>Most minotaurs have two names: a first name, which is often the same as their father's or mother's name, plus a descriptor. No matter how many children a minotaur has, odds are most of the males will have the same first name as their father and most of the females will have the same first name as their mother. The descriptors vary, but they're aspirational rather than earned. Since the descriptors are given by the parents when the minotaur is still an infant, they might or might not turn out to be accurate. For example, parents who want their child to be a great warrior might call it "the Fierce." If that minotaur grows up to become a poet rather than a warrior, it will still be called "the Fierce."

Bhain kwai are tall and barrel-chested like most minotaurs and have a thin, coarse coat of hair over their bodies. This hair ranges from black and brown to bronze and copper, with occasional rare bhain kwai born with white coats. Bhain kwai hooves are splayed and specially jointed, allowing for easier movement through the muddy terrain they call home. Their horns are upright and curved.
	These minotaurs make their homes in wet lowlands, often settling in river deltas, marshlands, and rainforests. Bhain kwai prefer small villages to sprawling cities, and they are much less warlike than their cousins. They are still strong and capable, however, and quickly roused to angry retribution if their homeland and people are threatened. Otherwise, the bhain kwai typically apply their mighty statures to caring for the land and to hard labor, able to carry and haul impressive loads for long hours.

You are a minotaur adapted to life in the bogs and wetlands of the world.

Unlike their cousins, these minotaurs prefer the highlands, living in hilly areas and mountain valleys. Most boghaid live in temperate climes, but some clans have moved even further north into subarctic areas. Boghaid are rugged and sturdy folk, adapted to the colder climes in which they live. They are covered in thick curly hair, growing longer and thicker on the top of the head, shoulders, back, and chest. Hair color ranges from black and dark brown to russet and fawn. Their large horns sweep out to the sides from the head before curling forward.
	Boghaid have a written language, but most of what is written is carved in stone. Their history and culture are primarily preserved in story and song, passed from one generation to the next during festivals and gatherings. Elders sing and tell tales to the younger boghaid, who learn the tales over time before passing them on to the next generation.

You are a minotaur adapted to life in cold climates and high altitudes.

      <text>Instead of descriptors, boghaid minotaurs have clan names. These names derive from the mighty heroes of their people that led them to the highlands and founded the first clans. These names are proceeded by the appropriate patronymic: ac, meaning "son of"; ae, meaning "daughter of"; or am, meaning "offspring of". Hence, the full name of the female boghaid Eva from Clan Torcall would be Eva Ae Torcall.

      <name>A Diverse Physiognomy</name>
      <text>The physical appearance of mushroomfolk is even more diverse than their flesh-and-blood counterparts. They have evolved appendages resembling arms and legs, as well as organs for taking in sensory information. Beyond that, they can be as different from one another as surface fungi are from each other, even within the same clan. Some mushroomfolk are tall and thin with caps like toadstools, while others might be short and squat like puffballs. Their diversity strengthens the survivability of their race and their clans.
	Mushroomfolk have no gender, and they are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Roughly once a year, a mushroomfolk is capable of creating a copy of itself via a specialized spore, which takes about 5 years to become an adult mushroomfolk. It's also possible for two mushroomfolk to combine spores and create a completely new type of mushroomfolk. This process takes longer, and usually only takes place when the clan is in a settlement phase. An adult grows from this process after about 10 years, but such individuals are considered hardier and a good omen for a clan.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Clans of Wanderers and Settlers</name>
      <text>The lives of the mushroomfolk are concerned mainly with the search for, or the tending of, sources of nutrition. This concern dictates the lifestyle, religion, ethos, and survival of the mushroomfolk. Clans of the creatures wander the depths of the world until they find an area rich in the nutrition they need to survive. If a large area of potential nutrition is found, the wandering clan changes its mode of operation. Specialists in raising creatures or farming vegetation take over, letting the scouts and wayfinders rest for a bit.
	At the same time, the scouts and wanderers from other clans might encounter a settled clan. Wandering newcomers join the settled clan for a time, learn from them, share spores to strengthen the clans, and determine if the clans must combine or split to ensure optimal chances of survival. Clans may settle for a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years. At some point, however, the nutrition runs out. Then the clan switches survival modes again, repeating the process as scouts are deployed and the clan goes on the move.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Mushroomfolk Religion</name>
      <text>Mushroomfolk gain sustenance from death and decay. Unlike the darakhul, however, they feed on creatures and vegetation that have died naturally and started to decay. This reliance on putrescence as a form of food often seems ghoulish to outsiders—or at least it seems so until the outsider encounters the darakhul.
	During important times of the year, the mushroomfolk perform elaborate rituals involving the finding and the harvesting of food: when scouts leave or return, when important sites of sustenance are found, when scouts of other clans join or leave, or similar. Even during less important times, mushroomfolk have small rites and rituals they perform that others might not even notice. Experts in religion who watch these rituals recognize them as a spattering of rites from different faiths. The most prevalent mimic those involved in the worship of deities of death and life-death cycles. However, the mushroomfolk have no idea of the powers they are worshipping: they simply revere the forces that bring the decay and rot that they need to survive.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Relations with the Darakhul</name>
      <text>The mushroomfolk have an interesting and unique relationship with the darakhul. They are no threat to the darakhul, but nor are they a potential food source. The darakhul, on the other hand, are a tasty treat to the mushroomfolk—even when still in an undead state, but especially after they have been destroyed. This is disconcerting to the darakhul.
	On the other hand, the trusting and placid nature of the mushroomfolk makes them a useful tool for the darakhul. Darakhul spies can count on getting honest intelligence from mushroomfolk scouts or clans they encounter. The mushroomfolk also understand that where darakhul armies march, there is often death, with rotting bodies to give them sustenance.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Mushroomfolk Names</name>
      <text>A mushroomfolk is given a name by the clan leaders when it becomes old enough to take on important work for the clan. The individual receives a name for itself, and it also takes on the name of its clan. A mushroomfolk without a clan uses only its given name, or it might take on a pseudonym if it lives in shame for past misdeeds.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The satarre call themselves the "devourers" or "those who end the world" due to their association with Nidhogg, the World-Eater. Others call them "Children of Nidhogg" to avoid drawing their direct attention and, frankly, out of fear for the attention. The satarre are rarely kind or compassionate; they are, at best, devoted, zealous servants of the gods of death and oblivion. More often they function directly as servants of Nidhogg, the dragon gnawing at the roots of the World Tree. Some believe the satarre have a distant connection to the dragonborn, though both sides deny any such affiliation.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Some Lazy, Some Striving</name>
      <text>The satarre are powerful and wise creatures often found serving dark cults or (less often) warning other races of the plans of such cults and seeking to prevent some disaster by prophecy, guidance, and cunning.
	Most of them strive to destroy the worlds of mortals and bring about the end of all things. They are relentless in the pursuit of knowledge, of the veneration of dark gods, and in their swift action to pursue any goal that might topple the World Tree and end a corrupt age. They are often advisors to cultists and evil priests.
	However, some of the satarre are simply in no such hurry to bring on the end of all things. Other satarre call these renegade satarre the latje, "the slothful ones. "Though not outwardly different from other satarre, the latje often see little purpose in destruction for its own sake, or they see their role as warning others of the dangers of the dark gods and the widening grasp of the cold, uncaring Void. Most latje are exiled from their communities or seek the company of other races, rather than remaining close to the world-ending ambitions of most of their kind. Their numbers have always been small.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Planar Travelers</name>
      <text>The satarre know the many worlds and their connections, and they are familiar with shadow, planar doorways, and similar arcana. They are comfortable speaking with demons, devils, and heralds of darkness, for their people have long been those who turn grand and maleficent visions into plans suitable for action.
	All satarre have a deep hatred of the volmar (also called the Children of Yggdrasil [see Creature Codex]) and the ravenfolk (see Midgard Heroes Handbook), for these two have long opposed the satarre's efforts on behalf of darkness and destruction.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Strong Void Speakers</name>
      <text>The satarre are speakers of Void Speech, the language of the Great Old Ones and of creatures that live in the darkness between stars, and the whispers and invocations of dark gods that drive others mad seem not to trouble the satarre. The satarre are a friend to the darakhul, tieflings, and vampires, and satarre and derro always seem to understand one another.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Satarre Names</name>
      <text>Satarre names are often similar to names of the cultures where they are raised, though satarre raised on the planes or in cults of darkness or death tend toward names common to those planes or that invoke the cult's tenets. Names in Void Speech are also common and are presented below.
	All satarre are given cult names, indicating which dark god their lives were dedicated to at their naming day. Such names preface the name of the cult or god with "ai-" and sometimes shorten the cult or god's name to two or three syllables. Most continue to serve or at least pray to these gods as adults, with varying degrees of piety. However, the latje satarre no longer use their cult names, preferring instead more neutral terms such as "ai-Vellec" (of the World) or
"ai-Rinska" (the Messenger).

      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Satarre grow quickly, walking soon after hatching and reaching the development of a 15-year-old human by age 6. They maintain the same appearance until about 50, then begin a rapid decline. Satarre often die violently, but those who live longer survive to no more than 65 years of age.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Satarre are born with a tendency toward evil akin to that of rapacious dragons, and, when raised among other satarre or darakhul, they are usually evil. Those raised among other cultures tend toward the norm for those cultures.</text>

    <trait category="species">
      <name>Carrier of Rot</name>
      <text>You can use your action to inflict rot on a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw also rots for 1 minute. A rotting creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns. The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to excise the rot with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check. The DC for the check equals the rot's Constitution saving throw DC. The rot also disappears if the target receives magical healing. The damage for the initial action and the rotting increases to 2d4 at 6th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 16th level. After you use your Carrier of Rot trait, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</text>

      <name>Languages</name>
      <text>You can speak, read, and write Common and one of the following: Abyssal, Infernal, or Void Speech. Void Speech is a language of dark gods and ancient blasphemies, and the mere sound of its sibilant tones makes many other creatures quite uncomfortable.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Life leaves echoes in its wake, whether crumbled remnants of a bygone civilization, tales of heroes and gods that spawn new beliefs, or even the echo of an individual soul left behind to haunt the living worla. Fantasy worlds are no strangers to ghosts and specters that linger beyond death, but sometimes a person's passion, purpose, and will to live are so strong, their tie to the living world so unbreakable, that their memories create a vessel for their soul after their body dies. These people are called shades. Shades can arise from any living race.
	There are rumors of darakhul or other undead leaving shades behind after destruction, but there are no reliable accounts of such a creature. It is more likely that an undead creature with strong enough will to become a shade becomes a shade of the race they were in true life.

    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Spirit and Flesh</name>
      <text>A shade possesses a physical body that looks, acts, and feels similar to a living member of their original race, at least superficially. Shades must breathe, consume food and drink, and require shelter from adverse weather. Despite the functional similarities to a living body, a shade isn't composed of flesh and blood. Their bodies are a memory of who they once were, inhabited and quickened by the presence of their soul. Exhaustion, deprivation, and injury take their toll on a shade's body, disrupting their body's ability to maintain the connection to their soul. Food, drink, and air aren't necessary to nourish their bodies but merely to help them maintain the sense of being a living, breathing creature. Similarly, shades appear to sleep, but they do not require it.
	The more injured or exhausted a shade, the less corporeal they appear. The colors of their body wash out to pale, desaturated tones, and light begins to pass through them. Blood from their wounds starts out as red and vibrant as any humanoid's, but closer to death, their wounds cease to bleed and seem to evaporate at the edges.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Living Memory</name>
      <text>The strength of a shade's memory of themselves and their place in life is the core of their being. Newer shades are almost impossible to distinguish from their prior, fully-living selves. Like anything exposed to the gnawing ravages of time, however, memory fades. The older a shade gets, the memories that keep them tethered to the living world begin to fray. They might grow forgetful, losing track of where they are or what year it is. Their memories might drift together, causing them to see people around them as figures from their past.
	Many shades keep detailed memoirs, tending to them with the same devotion that any living creature shows seeking out food and water. Shades can theoretically live forever, but in practice, the memories that tether them to life can't hold out indefinitely. Journals and other personal mementos help shades keep hold of themselves and allow them to last longer, sometimes for centuries.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Shade Adventurers</name>
      <text>Because they can arise from any people, shades come from all corners of the world and from all walks of life. Station and wealth are no guarantee to help one linger on after the body's death either. It's not unheard of for a person to die only to rise as a shade with little understanding that anything changed. Some even hide or dispose of their original remains, sometimes suppressing or deeply denying the act at all, and resume their life with no disruption. Anyone could secretly, sometimes even to themselves, be a shade.
	Some traveling shades leave their old lives behind, particularly those who were alone in life with no one to mourn them or fuel their memory. Such shades make up the majority of adventurers. Other more established shades might set out on a quest for the means to restore their true life or to protect loved ones from a threat.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Shades appear as the age they were when they died. They potentially have no limit to their lifespan, but, realistically, ancient shades grow weary and lose their hold on their memories, fading away near 750 years old.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>

During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet with the ability to hover, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't made with silvered weapons. In addition, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple or against being restrained, and you can move through creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain.
