    <text>Bombs are explosive devices. Though they are made in a variety of ways and styles, they each involve gunpowder. As such, bombs have the gunpowder weapon property (see the Weapons section of this chapter). As an action, you can ignite and throw a bomb up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the bomb as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes damage (and any additional effect), depending on the type of bomb.

Fireorb: These ornately engraved metal spheres are favored by dwarves. On a hit, this bomb deals 1d4 piercing damage plus 1d6 fire damage to the target, and each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage.

Mining: Miners often make bombs to help clear out large amounts of stone and ore; however, the bombs also can be used against structures or to destabilize foundations. These heavy bombs must be placed and ignited rather than thrown. After you light a mining bomb's fuse, it explodes at the end of your next turn. Each creature within I0 feet of the mining bomb when it explodes must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A nonmagical object or structure in the area that isn't being worn or carried takes 4d6 fire damage instead.

The creature must repeat the saving throw when it finishes its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature gains only the benefits of a short rest instead.

Poison: Poison use is controversial or even illegal in many societies due to the often subtle and deadly nature of poisons. The price listed is for one dose of the poison. Check with your GM before purchasing poison to determine which poisons are allowed in your game.

Contact: Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

Injury: Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or clashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

    <text>This poison is a thick syrup extracted from the petals of monkshood flowers. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature also loses the use of a single limb for 1 minute. The GM determines which limb and the effect of its temporary loss. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, regaining the use of its limb on a success.

    <text>This thin, black oil is extracted from plants killed by necrotic damage or other supernatural blight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 8 hours. While poisoned in this way, the creature's Strength score is reduced by 1d3 at the end of each hour. It then can repeat the saving throw, ending the poisoned effect on itself on a success. The creature dies if this reduces its Strength to 0, and a humanoid that dies from this poison rises 1d4 hours later as a shadow. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after it is no longer poisoned.

    <text>This sweet poison is distilled over a long time and requires a great deal of the venom produced by worker bees. It is indistinguishable from honey in taste. A creature that ingests this poison must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature crystalizes and is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to crystalized honey and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

Ingested: A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

Arcane Focus: An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.

If you succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check before striking the ground, you can land without taking falling damage.

    <text>A miniature grappling hook sits in the hollow of this wooden rod, attached to a drum holding a spool of 100 feet of strong rope. Two buttons on the rod activate the clockwork mechanism inside. As an action, you can press one button to launch the hook at a point you can see within 100 feet of you. The hook latches onto a ledge, rock, battlement, or other protrusion at the location, securing the rope. You can launch the hook at a point you can't see if it is an obvious location, such as a leaf-shrouded tree branch or the lip of a ledge above you. At the GM's discretion, some locations, such as narrow battlements or a steep roof, might require an attack roll or Dexterity check to successfully launch the hook at them or might not have the appropriate features for securing the hook.
	As a bonus action, you can press the second button on the rod to cause the rope to retract on its spool at a rate of so feet per round. If the grappling hook is secured to a location and you are holding this grappling rod, you and anything you are wearing or carrying are pulled toward the hook at the same rate of speed. The grappling rod can hold up to 500 pounds.

You can use an action to insert or remove an item from the self-sealing sphere. When you insert an item, you can whisper a short phrase, which must be 10 words or less, to the insect. When you rub the insect's belly, it mimics your voice and repeats the phrase. At the GM's discretion, this repetition can help you recall information related to the subject you told the memory sphere, granting you advantage on the check to recall the information.

    <text>This viscous alchemical liquid softens earth and stone. As an action, you can smear the contents of this jar onto a nonmagical object or structure made of earth or stone, weakening up to a 1-foot cube of it for 1 minute. For the duration, the object or structure's damage threshold is reduced by 5, and the weakened stone is pliable, becoming the consistency of firm clay. While the stone is softened in this way, you can write symbols in the stone, pull shackles or door hinges free from a wall, soundlessly embed a piton, or similar.
	Alternatively, you can use an action to pour the tar onto a construct or elemental made of earth or stone within 5 feet of you or throw it at such a creature within 20 feet of you, shattering the tar's container on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against the creature, treating the tar as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the structural integrity of the earthen or stone creature is weakened, reducing the creature's Armor Class by 2 for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that failed the saving throw takes 1d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
