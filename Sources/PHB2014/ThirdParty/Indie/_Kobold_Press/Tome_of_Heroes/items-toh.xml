    <text>Bombs are explosive devices. Though they are made in a variety of ways and styles, they each involve gunpowder. As such, bombs have the gunpowder weapon property (see the Weapons section of this chapter). As an action, you can ignite and throw a bomb up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the bomb as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes damage (and any additional effect), depending on the type of bomb.

Fireorb: These ornately engraved metal spheres are favored by dwarves. On a hit, this bomb deals 1d4 piercing damage plus 1d6 fire damage to the target, and each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage.

Mining: Miners often make bombs to help clear out large amounts of stone and ore; however, the bombs also can be used against structures or to destabilize foundations. These heavy bombs must be placed and ignited rather than thrown. After you light a mining bomb's fuse, it explodes at the end of your next turn. Each creature within I0 feet of the mining bomb when it explodes must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A nonmagical object or structure in the area that isn't being worn or carried takes 4d6 fire damage instead.

Contact: Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

Injury: Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or clashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

    <text>This poison is a thick syrup extracted from the petals of monkshood flowers. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature also loses the use of a single limb for 1 minute. The GM determines which limb and the effect of its temporary loss. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, regaining the use of its limb on a success.

The hook latches onto a ledge, rock, battlement, or other protrusion at the location, securing the rope. You can launch the hook at a point you can't see if it is an obvious location, such as a leaf-shrouded tree branch or the lip of a ledge above you. At the GM's discretion, some locations, such as narrow battlements or a steep roof, might require an attack roll or Dexterity check to successfully launch the hook at them or might not have the appropriate features for securing the hook.
	As a bonus action, you can press the second button on the rod to cause the rope to retract on its spool at a rate of so feet per round. If the grappling hook is secured to a location and you are holding this grappling rod, you and anything you are wearing or carrying are pulled toward the hook at the same rate of speed.

For the duration, the object or structure's damage threshold is reduced by 5, and the weakened stone is pliable, becoming the consistency of firm clay. While the stone is softened in this way, you can write symbols in the stone, pull shackles or door hinges free from a wall, soundlessly embed a piton, or similar.
	Alternatively, you can use an action to pour the tar onto a construct or elemental made of earth or stone within 5 feet of you or throw it at such a creature within 20 feet of you, shattering the tar's container on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against the creature, treating the tar as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the structural integrity of the earthen or stone creature is weakened, reducing the creature's Armor Class by 2 for 1 minute.

However, gearforged often find flesh-and-bone mounts to be finicky, unreliable, and temperamental, and they developed a mechanical steed for their own ease of use. These mechanical destriers never tire and don't eat, but their incredible bulk means they can't move quite as quickly as their living counterparts. A clockwork warhorse requires basic maintenance (no tools required) each week, requiring 1 hour of work and 1 gp worth of materials. Unlike other clockwork creations, a clockwork warhorse's control mechanism is the set of reins built into its head and neck instead of a control rod.

    <text>This modification allows a clockwork creation to hold one use of an alchemical substance, such as a vial of alchemist's fire or a dose of poison, in a special reservoir inside of it. The clockwork creation can empty the contents of its reservoir on a creature it hits with a melee attack, causing the target to suffer the effects of the substance, provided the substance can ordinarily affect a target hit by or in contact with it. The clockwork creation doesn't suffer the effects of the substance when the reservoir is emptied in this way, but it can still take damage from an alchemical substance outside the reservoir.
	Once emptied, the reservoir must be refilled before the clockwork creation can use it again. Refilling the reservoir with an alchemical substance takes 1 minute and requires one vial or dose of the appropriate substance. A clockwork creation with this modification can't have the Hidden Compartment modification.

    <text>The clockwork creation must have a Chemical Reservoir to take this modification, which increases the amount of alchemical substance the reservoir can hold. This modification expands the reservoir, but the reservoir remains one container. The doses placed in the reservoir must be of the same poison or alchemical substance. The expanded reservoir's maximum number of doses is limited by the size of the clockwork creation: 2 doses (Tiny), 3 doses (Small), 5 doses (Medium), or 7 doses (Large).
	Instead of emptying the reservoir when it hits with a melee attack, the clockwork creation now releases one dose of the substance. Refilling the reservoir takes 1 minute and requires the appropriate number of doses of the alchemical substance.

    <text>This modification can be applied to only the assassin snake, clockwork kestrel, clockwork lantern, or watch owl. A clockwork creation with this modification can serve a spellcaster as a familiar. As part of the process of adding this modification, the spellcaster and the clockwork creation must spend at least 4 hours each day participating in a ritual led by the clockwork crafter. During the ritual, the spellcaster absorbs the power of the control rod, and the control rod breaks. Thereafter, the clockwork creation forms a magic, telepathic bond with the spellcaster.
	While the two are bonded, the spellcaster can sense what the clockwork creation senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the clockwork creation is within 10 feet of the spellcaster, the spellcaster shares the clockwork creation's Magic Resistance trait. If the clockwork creation is damaged but not destroyed, the spellcaster can pay half the clockwork creation's purchase price to have it repaired, leaving this magical bond intact. Otherwise, the bond ends when the clockwork creation is destroyed.

    <text>This modification is a small crystal, usually in the head for clockwork creations that have heads, that allows the creation to record up to 1 hour of what it sees. The creation can start or end a recording as a bonus action. A creature holding the clockwork creation's control rod can use an action to project a recording in a space within 5 feet of the creation. The projected recording is an illusion that works like the silent image spell. The recording is visual and doesn't include any sounds that might have occurred at the time of the recording.
	The recounting crystal can retain only 1 hour of recordings at a time. A creature holding or carrying the control rod can erase any recordings on the recounting crystal, but it must either erase the entire 1 hour of recordings or erase recordings in increments of 1 minute.

This wide, flat-bottomed water vehicle is designed to carry crates and barrels of trade goods on a river. Barge poles are used to maneuver and propel river barges, but the barge's speed is largely subject to the river's current (typically 3 miles per hour), which is added to the barge's speed if it is moving downstream. The barge has a crew of two and no room for passengers. It can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores.

Designed to transport armored combatants across battlefields, this land vehicle is reinforced with metal bands and may be adorned with spikes, sturdy shields, or symbols related to the war party's cause. As a pulled vehicle, the war wagon's speed is dependent upon the speed of the horses pulling it, and it requires a team of at least two horses to move it. Multiple war wagons can be placed together in a circle to form a quick fortification, protecting those within the circle. War wagons are often designed with arrow slits or similar openings for attacking those outside the wagon. Creatures inside a war wagon or wagon circle have three-quarters cover from attacks outside the wagon or wagon circle. A war wagon has 30 hit points, an Armor Class of 17, and a damage threshold of 5. It has immunity to poison and psychic damage.

In deserts, a cavalry camel is worth its weight in exotic spices. Aggressive to others but loyal to their masters, these combat-trained beasts are as much a weapon as a mount and fight to the death to protect their riders if the riders are dismounted. Cavalry camels are usually single-humped dromedaries, though double-humped camels are not unknown on desert battlefields.

War Animal: A beast trained for combat, such as a warhorse or pit terrier, doesn't get spooked or flee when it is in an area of conflict. The beast knows which humanoids are friendly to it and which ones aren't, even in a pitched battle.
	Unless specified otherwise in its entry, a combat-trained beast will take commands from its designated humanoids. One such humanoid can use an action to command the beast to Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, or Use an Object by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a failure, the beast defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. The Use an Object command can be used to deliver an object to another humanoid or to fetch an object from a willing creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried. While a combat-trained beast is being used as a mount in mounted combat, it follows the rules for a controlled mount instead.
	A combat-trained beast can be trained to obey up to four humanoids. Each humanoid must spend one week training with the beast before it learns to obey that humanoid. If the beast is trained to obey a new humanoid when it already obeys four, it no longer obeys the humanoid whose most recent command to it was issued the longest amount of time ago and obeys the new humanoid instead. At the GM's discretion, a beast with a particularly strong bond with one or more humanoids might not forget those humanoids. In such cases, training the beast to obey a new humanoid when it already obeys four fails.

This tiny two-tone gray bird has black speckles on its wings, black bands on its body, and a piercingly intelligent look in its eyes. As it moves, the small feathers on its neck take on an almost metallic sheen. Military field commanders have used homing pigeons to send messages from the front to their superiors for centuries. The animals are prized for their relative intelligence and their uncanny ability to navigate to message delivery sites. A homing pigeon doesn't obey commands from designated humanoids. Instead, it can be trained to remember particular humanoids or locations, and it can deliver messages to these humanoids or locations with its Messenger trait. Any humanoid can attach a message to a homing pigeon and send it to one of the pigeon's remembered humanoids or locations. A homing pigeon can be trained to remember up to three humanoids or locations, and it takes one week of training with a particular humanoid or in a particular location for the pigeon to remember it. If you train a pigeon to remember a new humanoid or location when it already knows three, it forgets the humanoid or location it has not visited the longest and remembers the new one in its place.

Some jungle tribes know the secret of raising and training megaraptors and use them as mounts and beasts of war.

This low-slung dog has a compact, muscular body covered in short fur. Its legs are short and widespread, giving the creature a very low center of gravity.

War pigs are the bane of cavalry and other army units that make extensive use of animals. War pigs are often untrained. Officers of the army using them simply keep them penned in a dark, covered area until they are needed then set them loose on the enemy army immediately prior to their own army's advance. Some less scrupulous commanders douse their war pigs with pitch and set them aflame before spurring them toward the enemy. Such an incendiary war pig takes 1d6 fire damage each round but any creature that hits the war pig with a melee attack takes 1d6 fire damage.
