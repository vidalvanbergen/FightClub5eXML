        <name>Metamagic: Autonomous Spell (HB)</name>
        <text>When you cast a spell that has a duration of concentration, you can spend 3 sorcery points to cast it without requiring concentration. For example, using autonomous spell on detect magic changes its duration to 10 minutes. You can have only one autonomous spell in effect at a time. If you use this metamagic to modify a second spell, the first autonomous spell ends.

	For example, you use your action, expend a 4th-level spell slot, and spend 4 sorcery points to cast dimension door as a contingent spell that will take effect when a creature moves within 5 feet of you. When a creature moves within 5 feet of you a moment later, you use your reaction to trigger the dimension door and teleport to a space 200 feet away.

        <text>Your innate magic comes from the explosive power of raw alchemy and black powder. Your parents may have been alchemists, whose long exposure to alchemical reagents mingled with a latent talent for magic in their bloodlines and caused you to be born with such abilities. Or you may have been experimented upon—with or without your permission-when you were younger and those alchemical experiments brought this unexpected magical power to the surface. Whatever the catalyst for your powers, they bring with them an affinity for black powder, allowing you magical prowess that exploits its power to your benefit.

	• You can use your mage hand to draw or stow a pistol on your person or pick up a firearm within s feet of you that isn't being worn or carried. You can do this once on each of your turns for free, during either your move or your action.

	• You can use a bonus action to reload a pistol held by your mage hand. Your mage hand visibly becomes a pair of spectral hands to complete this action, the second hand vanishing once the pistol is loaded.

	• When a creature within 5 feet of you attacks you with a melee weapon, you can use a reaction to fire a pistol held by your mage hand at the attacker. Being within 5 feet of the target doesn't impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

You can create multiple mage hands with this feature when you reach higher levels. You gain a second mage hand at sth level, and an additional mage hand at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Unlike your primary mage hand, these additional mage hands can be used only for the tasks described under this feature and any other aspects of this class that reference this feature. Each extra mage hand remains within 5 feet of you and vanishes if it is unable to remain within 5 feet of you.

When you attack with a pistol held in one of your mage hands, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
	In addition, when you reach 2nd level, you can use an action and spend I or more sorcery points to magically reload and fire a pistol held by one of your mage hands. The ammunition fired is magically created and dissipates after being fired, hit or miss. For each sorcery point you spend, you can magically reload and fire another pistol held in another of your mage hands as part of the same action. These attacks have a range of 30 feet. Attacks from your mage hand-held pistols can attack separate targets or the same target, dealing damage, including the possibility of a burst, as normal on a hit. Each mage hand's attack counts as a separate attack for the purposes of determining the number of bursts that can happen. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

They worked their will upon the land and ocean and created works to show their mastery of the magical arts. Their artistry did not end with the landscape. They also experimented on any warm-blooded creatures they captured until they had warped and molded the creatures into new and deadly forms.
	One or more of your ancestors was experimented on or an associate of the world's earliest serpentfolk. Your ancestor's natural affinity for magic was nurtured, expanded, and warped by the experimentation of their ophidian masters in order to transform them into something closer to the serpentine ideal. Those alterations made so long ago have waxed in you, allowing you to influence intelligent creatures more easily. Now you must decide if you will follow the serpent's path of dominance and subjugation or if you will fight against their influence and use your power for a greater purpose.

Resonant Body Quirks:
d6 | Quirk
1 | You emit a faint hum, audible to any creature within 5 feet of you.
2 | In response to natural or magical thunder, your body flickers into brief transparency with the sound of each thunderclap.
3 | Beasts with the Keen Hearing trait initially respond aggressively when you come within 30 feet of them.
4 | If you hold a delicate, nonmagical glass object such as a crystal wine glass for longer than one round, the object shatters.
5 |  Every time you speak, your voice randomly changes in pitch, tone, and/or resonance, so that you never sound quite the same.

        <text>Rifthoppers are the living embodiment of wanderlust. The yearn to travel and witness unseen vistas burns in them and manifests in their ability to move nearly at the speed of thought. The origin of the rifthoppers' powers remains a mystery, as they refuse to stay in one place long enough to be studied extensively. Given the lack of empirical evidence, many scholars have hypothesized that rifthoppers absorb energy from the world itself, typically through an innate connection with ley lines or with areas where the borders between planes are thin, and can use it to alter their own magic.
	Adventuring rifthoppers often concern themselves with investigating mysterious portals to unknown locations, researching ley lines and other mystic phenomena, or seeking out and stopping spatial and temporal disturbances.

	When you reach 3rd level in this class, you can spend movement equal to your full speed, reducing your speed to 0 for the turn, and expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to teleport yourself to a destination within range. The range you can travel is dependent on the level of the spell slot expended as detailed in the Rifthopper Teleportation Distance table. You bring any objects you are wearing or carrying with you when you teleport, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your carrying capacity. If you teleport into an occupied space, you take 4d6 force damage and are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.

Careful Spell. If the spell allows a target to take only half damage on a successful saving throw, the linked target instead takes no damage.

Distant Spell. When you use this Metamagic option to increase the range of a touch spell, the spell's range is 60 feet when cast on the linked target.

Extended Spell. If cast on the linked target, the spell's duration is tripled rather than doubled, to a maximum of 36 hours.

Hungry Spell. If the linked target is reduced to 0 hit points with your hungry spell, you regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).

Lingering Spell. If the linked target failed its saving throw against your lingering spell, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid the additional damage at the start of your next turn.

Shared Hunger Spell. If you use this Metamagic option on the linked target, you and the target regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) if the target hits with its weapon attack.

Twinned Spell. By spending 1 additional sorcery point, you can affect the linked target in addition to the two original targets.

Binary Mind. Your cranium is larger than most creatures of your type and houses your enlarged brain, which is partitioned in a manner that allows you to work on simultaneous tasks. You can use the Search action or make an Intelligence or Wisdom check as a bonus action on your turn.

Digitigrade Legs. Your legs are similar to the rear legs of a wolf or horse. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet, and you can stand up from prone by spending 5 feet of movement rather than half your speed.

Grasping Tentacle. You can use an action to transform one of your arms into a grotesque tentacle. The tentacle is a natural melee weapon with the reach property, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and the tentacle deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. At the start of your turn, if you are grappling a creature with the tentacle, you can deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to it. You don't have fine motor control over your tentacle, and you can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of spells. You can revert your tentacle back into an arm as a bonus action.

Prehensile Tail. You have a prehensile tail, which allows you to take the Use an Object action as a bonus action on your turn. Your tail can't wield weapons or shields, but it is capable of some manual precision, allowing you to use your tail to hold material components or perform the somatic components of spells.

The alteration you chose from your Alien Alteration feature evolves as described below. Alternatively, you can choose a second option from the Alien Alteration feature instead of evolving the alteration you chose.

Caustic Tentacle (Grasping Tentacle). Your tentacle excretes acidic mucus. You can use a bonus action to suppress the mucus until the start of your next turn. While the tentacle excretes acidic mucus, it deals an extra 2d6 acid damage to any target it hits. A creature that is grappled by your tentacle at the start of your turn takes the extra acid damage when it takes the bludgeoning damage.

Cognitive Split (Binary Mind). Your cranium expands even further as your brain swells in size. When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to make one melee or ranged weapon attack against a target in range.

Fell Sprinter (Digitigrade Legs). Your legs elongate and your body sheds some of its weight to allow you to reach greater speeds. You can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of your turns. When you Dash, the extra movement you gain is double your speed instead of equal to your speed.

Third Arm (Prehensile Tail). Your tail extends to a length of 15 feet and the end splits into five fingerlike appendages. You can do anything with your tail you could do with a hand, such as wield a weapon. In addition, you can use your tail to drink a potion as a bonus action.

        <text>At 18th level, your body becomes more mutable. You can use a bonus action to gain a second option from the Alien Alteration feature and its evolved form from the Advanced Transformation feature for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
