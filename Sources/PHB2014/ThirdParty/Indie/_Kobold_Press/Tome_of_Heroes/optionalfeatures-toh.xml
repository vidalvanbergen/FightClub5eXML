    <text>When you roll a 1 on a damage die for an attack you make with a weapon that has the gunpowder property, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1. The weapon must have the gunpowder property for you to gain this benefit.

    <text>Prerequisite: melee weapon that deals bludgeoning damage

As an action, you can assail a hostile creature within range of your weapon with a series of rapid, superficial strikes, putting the target on the defensive. Make an attack roll with this weapon. On a hit, the target's mental focus shifts to defending itself. All attack rolls against the target have disadvantage until the start of your next turn, but the target has disadvantage on the next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
