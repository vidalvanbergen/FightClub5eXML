      <name>Witch Light</name>
      <text>Wisdom saving throw: DC 13. Failure: The target becomes charmed. While charmed, the target must spend all movement points to move towards the Lamplighter during their turn. The target makes a saving throw at the end of their turn, which, if successful, ends the effect. If the target takes damage from the Lamplighter, the saving throw used to end the effect is made with advantage. After 1 minute, the target is no longer charmed by the Lamplighter.</text>

    <description>The creature is draped in a dark, tattered, cloth covering its hunched back, from which hang two enormous lanterns. Its arms and legs are thin and long, making it walk on all fours as if on stilts. Its face is expressionless, pale, and its eyes like empty, black pools of water. When it opens its mouth, its jaws twist, revealing a gaping maw filled with sharp, hooked teeth. When the lanterns are lit, particles of arcane energy swirl around it, and the creature emits an agonizing shriek.

Combat Tactics
During the day, the Lamplighters hide in dark, dilapidated buildings or huts, only appearing at dusk. They patrol the city all night, using magic to light up the destroyed streetlights, ensuring that the main roads are adequately illuminated.
	The soft glow emitted by the Lamplighters as they appear amidst the ruins can be seen from afar. These creatures use their "lantern beams" to repel other creatures from a distance or lure unsuspecting prey closer. Once the prey is close enough, the lamplighter attacks and devours them with its greedy maw.
	Lamplighters whose health drops to 1/4 or below typically flee to the ruins to recover. These creatures consider the streets where they worked when they were still human as their territory. Once healed, they return to their territory to continue protecting their precious lights from intruders.
	Since Lamplighters are naturally drawn to the dark areas of Drakkenheim, characters can usually avoid them by staying within areas already illuminated by their lanterns. Similarly, extinguishing the lights along the main roads will lure lamplighters to specific locations, forcing these creatures to relight their lanterns.

Study the enemy.
Characters with natural or survival skills gain Advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks when they Study a Lamplighter, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) You recognise the creature's resistances.
(15+) You know the creature's Lantern Beam ability and its multiple options.
(20+) You are aware of its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.
