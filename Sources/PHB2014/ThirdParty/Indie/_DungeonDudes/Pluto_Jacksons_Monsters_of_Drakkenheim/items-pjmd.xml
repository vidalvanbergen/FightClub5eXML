    <text>The toolkit provides everything characters need to extract animus and preserve any creature parts. This kit contains skinning knives, a cleaver, syringes, a hammer, scissors, scalpels, a bone saw, hooks, as well as vials, watertight containers, binding reagents, and wrappings.

Harvesting Components:
Characters may harvest and preserve Components from the corpse of a slain creature using monster harvesting tools.
	Harvesting monster components or extracting its animus must begin within ten minutes of its death. After this time, the magical energy within fades and the animus passes to the ether, and any remaining Components are no longer usable for creating magic items.
	No ability checks are required to successfully harvest monsters or extract an animus. As long as a character has the time and tools, they always successfully collect one monster Component from a creature's corpse. The toolkit provides everything a character needs to extract and preserve parts from any creature.

Monster Components:
When the characters decide to harvest a monster's corpse, the Game Master determines which Components can be harvested from a monster, if any. In this book, each monster entry lists the Components available from that creature.

Component Rarity:
The rarity of all parts are determined by the CR of the monster as presented by the table earlier in this chapter. Most item recipes call for Components with the same rarity as the item itself. However, some recipes may call for a component from a specific named monster, such as a Frost Giant, an Ancient Red Dragon, or a Banshee. In such cases, if no part of the presented rarity is available for a monster of that type, the DM should allow a component of a lower rarity to be used. For example, the ghost site bow is a Very Rare item that requires the bones of a Dryad and the hair of a Banshee. In this case, these components require you to find any Dryad or Banshee and do not require the parts to be Very Rare.

Component Categories:
Each Component belongs to one of the following categories:

	• Animus. This special Component is described below.
	• Bones. This includes the skull, spine, or the stem of a plant monster.
	• Dust. Detritus left behind by magical creatures or undead.
	• Fluid. Usually monster blood, and also ectoplasm, sap, or mucus.
	• Hair. Any fur or feathers.
	• Hide. Includes the monster's skin, scales, carapace, bark, or plates.
	• Natural Weapons. Almost any natural weapon from the monster's game statistics, such as teeth, claws, horns, tentacles, etc.
	• Organs. A broad category including both internal body parts and sensory organs, such as the heart, brain, glands, eyes, or guts.

Magical Animus:
In the world of Drakkenheim, magic items are created by imbuing a physical object with a metaphysical animus. This vital energy must be properly extracted from a magical creature. A creature's animus is formed from the latent magical energy held within its body, but it is distinct from a creature's soul. Aberrations, Celestials, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, Giants, Monstrosities, Plants, Oozes, and Undead all possess a magical animus. Beasts and Humanoids typically do not possess an animus.
	When a creature is slain, its animus lingers momentarily before fading into the ether. However, a creature's animus can be collected and contained within a vessel of some kind, which is then used to make a magical item. It is impossible to extract the animus of a creature without killing it.
	Creating magic items requires the animus of one or more suitably powerful creatures. However, some magic items may call for a specific type of animus, such as the animus of a fey creature or dragon. In rare cases, a magic item may require the animus of a much more specific monster.
	 Animus Vessels. An animus must be collected and stored in a specially prepared magical vessel. Traditionally, these vessels were minor magic items in their own right: often rune-etched gemstones infused with magic and created in a laborious process. However, the world of Drakkenheim was transformed by the arrival of delerium: the eldritch crystals function as suitable vessels in their raw state. A delerium crystal filled with magical animus glows with a brilliant octarine light, similar to how the crystals resonate with energy when exposed to magic.
	Creating Animus Vessels. An animus vessel can be created in 1 hour by combining any three other components of the same rarity. The resulting vessel can then be used as a vessel for an animus of the corresponding rarity. For example, an animus made from three Rare components can hold a Rare animus.

Animus Vessel Crystal Sizes
Animus Rarity     | Required Delerium Crystal Size
Common     | Chip
Uncommon     | Fragment
Rare         | Shard
Very Rare     | Crystal
Legendary     | Geode

Harvest and Extraction Time.
Once started, collecting Components or animus takes ten minutes of work. During this time, the character must remain within 5 feet of the corpse. If the process is interrupted, harvesting must resume within ten minutes, or the Components are lost. A player character may only harvest Components from one creature at a time, regardless of its size. Several characters can work together to harvest multiple parts from the same corpse. No matter how many characters harvest a single corpse, they must all spend ten minutes harvesting.

Collector's Choice
Each character may harvest one component from a creature's corpse per encounter. Characters can work together to harvest several different parts from one monster, or they may split up and harvest parts from several creatures at once. A monster's body usually provides only one of each available part, so two characters harvesting parts from the same corpse must choose to collect different parts, unless the Game Master determines that the creature's unique physiology allows the collection of multiples of the same part. For example, a Game Master might allow both horns from a Minotaur to be harvested, but it would take the work of two characters to collect both. Other parts may be more abstract in quantity: it's enough to know that the characters collected a bag of dragon fangs or a vial of troll blood without worrying about a specific measurement.
	When the player characters decide to butcher a carcass for Components, the Game Master lists all the possible Components available from the body. Each character may then choose one Component to collect. All other Components are lost and unusable, either because they were damaged in battle, ruined in the harvesting process, or deemed of unsuitable quality for magic item crafting.

	 If you consume more than one dose of aqua delerium before finishing a Long Rest, you take 1d12 Necrotic damage for each spell slot level regained from the second dose, and your Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until you finish a Long Rest. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.
	When a creature who cannot cast spells using spell slots drinks Aqua Delerium, it takes 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage and gains one level of Contamination.

	While attuned to this weapon, you can use a Bonus Action to see into the Ethereal Plane and see all invisible creatures and objects until the end of your turn. Additionally, you can see through all walls and solid objects within 60 feet of you until the end of your turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Crafting. Creating a Rat Tooth Dagger requires a Rare Workshop and the following Rare Components:

	• [Animus] Any Animus
	• [Fluid] Venom
	• [Hide] Bark
	• [Natural Weapons] Claws from a Ratling

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
