    <text>By manipulating reality with your dragon power, you teleport up to 30 feet and make a weapon attack. This attack deals an extra 3d8 force damage on a hit. You may also teleport up to two allies within 60 feet of you to unoccupied spaces adjacent to your target. Then, each of these allies can make a weapon attack against the target. You must see the place to teleport you and your allies.

    <text>You emulate a dragon's flight, creating wings that allow you to ascend without provoking attacks of opportunity. All creatures within 15 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The wings dissipate at the end of your next turn, and if it ends while you are still in the air, you descend gently, avoiding damage from falling.
