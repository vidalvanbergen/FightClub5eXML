Winter Magic. This magic ring has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend its charges to cast one of the following spells (spell save DC 17): ice storm (1 charge), cone of cold (2 charges), or wall of ice (3 charges). 

Aura of Cold. As an action, you can speak the ring's command word to cause the temperature to drop drastically around you for 1 minute. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of you takes 1d6 cold damage. In addition, a sheen of slippery ice forms in any square you move through. The ice is difficult terrain and a creature that starts its turn there or enters the area for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. The ice melts away after 1 minute. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>When the string on this magic shortbow is drawn, the goblinoid face decorating the bow comes to life, muttering curses and spitting insults in Goblin. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using this bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage if it has dealt damage to you since the end of your last turn. 

Witch's Soul. This bow has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend its charges to cast one of the following spells (spell save DC 15): bane (1 charge), silence (2 charges), or bestow curse (3 charges).

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: simple, shortbow

    <text>When you hit with an attack roll using this magic shortsword, the creature takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

Life Drain. When you hit a creature with this shortsword, you can force that creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers 1 level of exhaustion and is paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. While the target is paralyzed this way, you can use an action on each of your turns to cause it to suffer 1 level of exhaustion and you regain 4d6 hit points. The effect ends if the target dies, if you use your action to do anything else, or if you or the shortsword is ever more than 5 feet away from the target. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This sturdy and worn satchel is filled with 7 weirdly malformed gobbets of flesh.
	As an action, you can pull a gobbet of flesh from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the gobbet lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table below (if you roll a creature that has already been summoned by the bag, roll again).

Bag of Monsters:
d8 | Creature
1 | Ankheg
2 | Basilisk
3 | Darkmantle
4 | Manticore
5 | Mimic
6 | Owlbear
7 | Rust Monster
8 | Choose a creature from the list above

When the creature drops to 0 hit points or when 1 hour has passed it crumbles into dust and a new gobbet of flesh representing the creature reforms inside the bag.
	The creature is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, it shares your initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. If you are unconscious at the start of your turn, you lose control of all creatures summoned from the bag. 
	Whenever you use the bag to summon a creature, roll a d4. If the result is equal to or lower than the number of creatures currently summoned with the bag (including the creature you just summoned), you lose control of all creatures summoned from the bag. 
	A creature no longer under your control acts at the GM's discretion, possibly attacking the creature closest to it or fleeing to find safety. The summoned creature no longer dissolves into dust when 1 hour has passed, but instead persists until it drops to 0 hit points. Still bound by the bag's magic, the creature will not stray far from whoever carries the bag and instead remains in the general area. If control over a creature is lost, that creature can't be summoned by the bag again until it is slain and its gobbet of flesh has reformed in the bag.
	Once three gobbets of flesh have been pulled from the bag, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

The bag can hold up to 250 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 32 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. It functions as a bag of holding, except as noted below.

Shared Holding. Two creatures each holding one end of the drawstring at the bag's neck can use an action to tie it shut. As they do so, their names (the names most commonly used to refer to them) appear on the side of the bag, etched in gold thread and the bag can be reopened only by these two creatures pulling on its string together. Destroying the bag causes its contents to be scattered in the Astral Plane. Once reopened, the creatures' names disappear from the bag and it can be used freely until its string is tied again this way.

When you hit a creature with an attack roll using this dagger, you can expend 1 charge to deal an additional 2d6 poison damage to the target or 3 charges to turn the target into stone as if you had cast the flesh to stone spell (save DC 15) from the dagger.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

While charmed this way, the target is also stunned. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends for the target if it takes damage, if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor, or it can no longer see itself in the mirror.

	If the original creature dies while its clone is in the flask, its soul transfers to the clone as long as the soul is free and willing to return. The clone then grows to the original creature's full size, shattering the flask. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the equipment belonging to the original. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life by any means since the creature's soul is elsewhere.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This magic book holds hundreds of pages, half of which contain arcane scribblings in a neat handwriting. You can use this book as your spellbook and scribe new spells into it. Creatures that have advantage on saving throws against spells don't have advantage against wizard spells you cast while holding this spellbook.

Master Wizard. The spellbook is sentient and has the personality of a master wizard. Its alignment is determined by the GM or by rolling a d4; 1: neutral good, 2: lawful neutral, 3: chaotic neutral, 4: neutral evil. The book has an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom  of 12, and a Charisma of 10. It speaks, reads, and understands Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Infernal, and can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. While the wizard's sentience within remembers nothing of who it was in life, it still possesses a wealth of knowledge. If you spend at least 1 minute discussing an arcane topic, such as a mythical event, a spell, a creature, or a magic item, with the spellbook, you gain advantage on any Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion checks pertaining to that topic.

Impromptu Memorization. As a bonus action, you can replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell scribed in the book as the spellbook whispers the spell's incantation to you. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>When you cast a spell while wearing this magic diadem, you gain temporary hit points equal to the level of the spell (minimum of 1 hit point).

Contingency. This diadem can store a single spell cast into it. During a process that takes 10 minutes, any creature can cast a spell of up to 5th level that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you, into the diadem by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, but is stored in the diadem until a circumstance described by you occurs. The spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to. The spell uses the spell slot level, spell save DC, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. Once the spell takes effect, it is gone from the diadem and a new spell can't be stored in the diadem until the next dawn.

    <text>This magic cape has 33 hit points and regains all hit points daily at dawn. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you and the cape takes the other half. If the cape is reduced to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

Rug of Smothering. As a bonus action, you can speak the cape's command word to cause it to animate. The animated cape has the statistics of a rug of smothering, except for its hit points, which remain the same in either form. The cape is under your control and acts on its own initiative count. On your turn, feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the cape takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies. The cape reverts to its inanimate form after 1 minute or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>When you hit with an attack roll using this magic longbow, the target takes an extra 1d8 poison damage. In addition, while you are carrying the bow, you have immunity to poison damage and can't be poisoned. 

Spider's Web. The bow has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using this bow, you can expend 1 charge to have magical webbing envelop it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained (escape DC 15) until the end of its next turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text>Once per turn, when you hit a hostile creature with an attack roll using this dagger, the dagger gains 1 charge. As an action, you can expend its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 15): hold person (2 charges), invisibility (2 charges) lightning bolt (3 charges), or thunderwave (1 charge). When you cast a spell this way, you can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.
	If the dagger hasn't been used to make an attack against a hostile creature for 1 minute, it loses all its charges.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Hail of Thorns. When you roll a 20 on your attack roll using this magic longbow, a rain of thorns sprays from the arrow. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC. 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

Up to three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets within 30 feet of it. A target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.

    <text>This magic book contains descriptions of a seemingly infinite assortment of creatures. You can reference the book whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about a type or subtype of creature (such as an Elf, a Dragon, or a Zombie). When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check. 
 
Instant Recollection. The book has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As a bonus action, you can speak its command word to magically recall information about a creature you can see within 30 feet. Choose one of the following pieces of information to learn:

	• The creature's AC, maximum Hit Points, and Speed.

	• The creature's Ability Scores and Saving Throw proficiencies.

	• The creature's Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, and Condition Immunities, if it has any. 

	• Which actions the creature has, though not the exact details of those actions.

	• Any special qualities and defenses, such as Legendary Resistance or Magic Resistance.

If the creature has statistics beyond what is typical for its race, type, or subtype (such as a Goblin with special actions and additional hit points), you may not able to learn these unique statistics, at the GM's discretion.
