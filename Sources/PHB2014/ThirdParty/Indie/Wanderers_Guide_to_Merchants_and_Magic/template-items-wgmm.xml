    <text>Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack roll using this magic weapon, you can force the target to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, whenever the target makes an attack roll or saving throw until the end of your next turn, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.</text>

    <text>When you roll a 20 on your attack roll using this magic weapon, the target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or burst into laughter if it is a creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. On a failure, the target falls prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

    <text>This magic crossbow has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge and set the crossbow's sight on a target you can see within 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you choose a new target, you have advantage on ranged attack rolls against it using this weapon. In addition, you ignore half cover and three-quarters cover when making ranged attacks against the target with this crossbow. If the target becomes invisible or heavily obscured, you can see it as if it was fully visible.</text>

    <text>When your current hit points are equal to or less than half your hit point maximum while wearing this magic armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. 

Last Stand. When you drop to 0 hit points while wearing this armor, you can choose to remain conscious instead. If you do so, you gain immunity to all damage, have advantage on weapon attack rolls, and weapon attacks you make deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage until the end of your next turn. If you still have 0 hit points at the end of your next turn, you fall unconscious and are dying. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</text>
