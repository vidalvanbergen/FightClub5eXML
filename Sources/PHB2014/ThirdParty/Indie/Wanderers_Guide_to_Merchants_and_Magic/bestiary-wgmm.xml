    <description>Azân is a fiend who opened up a shop after being cast out from Hell. His many magical treasures have been collected over centuries of travel to everywhere from the biggest trading hubs in the largest cities to the most obscure places at the edge of the world — and across many different planes of existence. Azân's shop can be found anywhere — or nowhere at all, depending on who is looking.

Only a handful of creatures know that Azân used to be a respected fiendish lord, who led and lost a rebellion against an archfiend on his native plane. As a result, Azân had his horns and titles stripped away and was banished from his homeland.
	What started as an eternal and purposeless existence, wandering from city to city across planes and continents, eventually became Azân's new purpose. Equipped only with his keen mind, a deep appreciation of the arcane, and a warm demeanor, Azân began picking up exotic trinkets, rare materials, and other oddities on his long journeys.
	Though Azân no longer has the fighting spirit of his youth, his infernal magic and ageless body are as strong as ever. Azân is confident in the knowledge that most mortal beings are no immediate danger to him, which has made him rather lax over the years.

Roleplaying Azân and Jaziel:
Having lived for nearly a millennium, it takes a lot to rattle Azân, who always seems to have a warm and welcoming attitude. He laughs wholeheartedly at jokes, even those aimed at himself, and meets even direct threats with a shrug and a chuckle. While Azân won't share the details of his past ("I sell goods, not stories, friend, and what I have to tell ain't worth much to you anyway") he is a polite listener with a soft spot for outcasts and underdogs.
	In stark contrast to Azân's friendly demeanor, his companion Jaziel carefully scrutinizes every action customers take. While he resembles a dog – albeit with a long and slender tail – Jaziel is in truth a gydrash, a highly intelligent celestial creature. Jaziel likes to hide the fact that he can speak, but if someone touches the rare merchandise without permission, he breaks his silence to warn them that "I would think twice before doing that" in a cold, nasal voice. If a character tries to pat Jaziel, he growls fiercely, prompting Azân to laughingly explain that "Jaziel doesn't like to be touched. Best take your hands off before he does."
	Despite his gruff exterior, Jaziel loves a good trade – if the characters are serious about doing business, he will quickly warm to them.

Bargaining:
Already very wealthy and having few vices, gold holds no real value to Azân. As a result, he usually initiates bargains by naming a price that's a little too good, before a quick telepathic objection from Jaziel makes him correct himself: "That'll be 400 gold. Oh, wait you know what, better say 500 gold pieces!"
	Likewise, haggling with Azân isn't too difficult and he may even be persuaded to drop his prices all the way down to half the item's value. This, however, causes Jaziel to "break cover" and speak up: "Stop it, you fool, you're practically giving it away!" When this happens, Azân usually defers to his companion and brings the price back up.

Biases:
Azân always roots for the underdog. Whether that's the tiefling outcast, the disheveled urchin, or the fighter who's lost an arm, Azân offers discounts to characters who are down on their luck or have the odds against them (ignoring Jaziel's objections).
	On the other hand, Azân has a clear disdain for those who believe themselves above others, such as arrogant nobles or self-centered bards. Customers who behave haughtily or are overly flashy irk the otherwise good-natured merchant and will find his prices to be higher than usual.

Shop Security:
Azân's shop is kept safe by the fiend himself and the watchful eyes of Jaziel, and his wares can be quickly stowed away in a portable hole.

Powerful Fiend:
Despite his relaxed attitude, Azân is more than capable of defending himself. He is protected not only by his magical items but also by his fiendish magic. If Azân is ever in a situation too hot to handle, he will grab the makeshift door he carries in his portable hole and use his key to anywhere to magically teleport away.

Guardian Angel:
Jaziel's truesight gives any character who attempts to steal from the shop a hard time. If a character is caught attempting to pocket something, Jaziel telepathically alerts Azân. As long as the characters don't respond with violence, Azân tries to deescalate the situation by shrugging the attempted theft off as a misunderstanding.

Never Unattended:
Azân's stand and most of his merchandise are placed near a magical black cloth, which works as a portable hole. This means that Azân can pack down his entire shop in a matter of seconds – which he does whenever he goes anywhere, never leaving the shop unattended.

    <description>Brumir Bronzeforge, stout dwarf and accomplished merchant, has been spearheading the Bronzeforge Clan's most lucrative business dealings for almost a century. In the Bronzeforge Halls, Brumir converts his clan's marvelous creations into vast amounts of gold and gemstones – with an emphasis on the latter.
	The Bronzeforge Halls can be placed in any city where dwarves live and prosper. The halls would fit especially well in the merchant's district of a larger city where fortunes can be made satisfying a demand for well-crafted – and even magic – trinkets, weapons, and suits of armor.

Brumir is a short and plump middle-aged dwarf who displays an impressive gray-brown beard and has a passion for dwarven ale and gemstones – a dwarf's dwarf, in other words.
	Brumir was in no way fated to run the most profitable unit in the Bronzeforge Clan's business empire. As a youth, he showed no talent as an craftsman at the family's anvils, nor prominence on the battlefield, or interest in religious teachings. Short on options, Brumir's father decided that his youngest son was to be trained as a merchant.
	As luck had it, Brumir was a natural-born salesman. Bartering and haggling came easy to the young dwarf, and the pursuit of wealth – especially deliciously large gemstones, which Brumir has a particular weakness for – drove Brumir more than anything ever had. For nearly a century, Brumir has worked hard to make the Bronzeforge Halls into a well-known, well-protected, and successful emporium of high-quality armor, weapons, and jewelry.

Roleplaying Brumir:
As long as Brumir smells profits, he can be a gracious and downright pleasant host, who will take the time to sit down and trade pleasantries with customers.
	Brumir has a strong sense of honor and is always true to his word. He abhors lying (though mild exaggeration has never hurt anyone!) and confronts liars with tirades such as: "Ha! Sure 'bout that, laddie?
Smells like a bunch of good ol' bauxite refinery!"
	Brumir has long since learned to cope with insults aimed at him and handles even dire threats with a defusing smile. The stocky dwarf, however, has a hard time accepting insults aimed at the Bronzeforge Clan or the craftsmanship of the items in his inventory. If a customer crosses this line, Brumir's face darkens and his voice grows cold: "'Ware yer words now, friend. Ye're in the Bronzeforge Halls and we ain't no band of bumblin' bugbears to be pushed around as ye like!"

Bargaining:
Brumir is a skilled merchant who drives an extremely hard bargain. If he is selling, which is his preference, he starts out asking for well above an item's true value.
	Stubborn himself, Brumir respects persistence in his customers. If faced with a tough bargainer, he may lower his prices to about the item's market value, but fights back against further discounts: "Thinkin' me softer than sandstone, lass? By me ma's beard, what ye suggest is daylight robbery!"
	One thing that can land a favorable deal in Brumir's shop is large gemstones. Brumir has such an extreme love for valuable gems, the larger the better, that it borders on the obsessive. Brumir's avarice may cause him to pay up to twice the market value for gemstones worth more than 1,000 gp.

Biases:
Brumir respects elven craftsmanship, but he holds no love for the elves themselves, as he regards them as arrogant and annoying know-it-alls. Elves are likely to find Brumir's prices even steeper than usual.
	Conversely, Brumir usually offers discounts to any dwarf who shares his ideals and humor. Dwarf or not, Brumir also respects anyone who has a proper beard – even elves, although he's "never met an elf with a beard, and that's how I be knowin' them pointy-eared bastards ain't to be trusted!"

Shop Security:
Brumir is by no means a warrior (he has the statistics of a noble). Aware of this fact, the dwarf merchant has taken numerous steps to protect himself and, most importantly, his clan's inventory.

Stripped of Weapons:
Brumir's cousin, a priest named Tribur Bronzeforge, acts as gatekeeper to the Bronzeforge Halls and asks each character to hand over their weapons to a steward upon entry to the shop. Additionally, he casts a zone of truth and asks all characters who wish to enter if they intend to harm anyone or steal any items while inside the shop. Anyone who can't answer a clear no to that question is refused entry.

Antimagic Field:
The bronze murals in the Bronzeforge Halls are not just for display. The murals create an antimagic field spell that suppresses the effects of any magic items and renders it impossible to cast any spells while inside the shop. The effect can only be ended by destroying at least six 5-foot sections of the murals (AC 16; 30 hit points; damage threshold 15; resistance to all nonmagical damage, and immunity to piercing, poison, and psychic damage).

Elite Guardians:
As a more tangible protective measure, a squad of bronzeforge elite guards stands ready to protect the Bronzeforge Clan's inventory. Day or night, at least two guards stand watch outside the Bronzeforge Halls and at least four guards remain close to Brumir and the valuable inventory.

Adamantine Vault:
Most of the shop's magic items and precious metals are locked inside an adamantine vault when the shop is closed at night. The vault is hidden behind one of the bronze murals and can be found with a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Once the mural, which is set on hinges, is pushed aside, a 5-foot-square adamantine door is visible. The door is locked and can only be opened with a key that Brumir keeps on a chain around his neck.
