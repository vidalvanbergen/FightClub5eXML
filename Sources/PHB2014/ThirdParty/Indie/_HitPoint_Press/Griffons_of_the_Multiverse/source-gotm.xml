  <description>A collection of twenty unique griffon stat blocks for 5e!

This compendium contains twenty new and illustrated griffon stat blocks with which to populate your worlds. Since normal griffons from the Material Plane combine elements from both eagles and lions, it stands to reason that other griffons found across the Planes of Existence may have even more miraculous combinations...

Use these entries to add both variety and unique familiarity to your far-flung adventures in Fifth Edition!</description>
