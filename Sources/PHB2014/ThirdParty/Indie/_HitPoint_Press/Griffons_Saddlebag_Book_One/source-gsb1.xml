  <description>This lushly printed hardcover book is filled with 365 magic items that have been designed, illustrated, and balanced for Fifth Edition by The Griffon's Saddlebag. Fill your campaign with exciting new magical items, such as the dragon tamer's lance or catnip amulet, and reward your players with treasure as unique as their characters. Each item has also been carefully organized into easily searchable charts and random treasure tables. These magical items have been peer-reviewed by thousands of players around the world and strike a charming balance of mechanical intrigue, memorable flavor, and exciting role-playing opportunities.
 
This 208-page book also includes 12 new character subclasses, 3 new settings, a setting-agnostic villain, and a uniquely customizable playable race. If you're tired of using the same old flaming swords or worry about balancing your own magical items, this may be the book you're looking for.
 
If you like handing out physical rewards to your players, consider purchasing The Griffon's Saddlebag item cards as well! This book includes the same items as the cards from volumes 1 through 7, so you can use this compendium as your master index while handing out physical rewards to incentivize your players!</description>
