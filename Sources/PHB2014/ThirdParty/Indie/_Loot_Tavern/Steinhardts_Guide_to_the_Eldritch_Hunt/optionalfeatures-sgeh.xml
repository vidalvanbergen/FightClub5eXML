    <classes>Eldritch Invocations</classes>
    <text>Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Trigger feature (revolver form)

As a bonus action, you temporarily duplicate your hex gun to unleash a flurry of bullets. All creatures within a 15-foot cone in front of you must succeed a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 force damage. This damage increases to 3d10 at 11th level and 4d10 at 17th level. To use this bonus action, you need to be holding your hex gun in one hand and have the other hand free.
	You can use this invocation a number of times equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of twice),
and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with an attack made using your hex gun, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone and have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

    <text>Prerequisite: 9th level, Pact of the Trigger feature (sniper form)

As a bonus action, you can enhance your focus to see the weak spots of your foes. For the next minute, attacks you make using your hex gun score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Once you've used this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

    <time>1 Reaction</time>
    <classes>Eldritch Invocations</classes>
    <text>Prerequisite: 7th level, Pact of the Trigger feature

Your reflexes are honed. As a reaction, when an enemy makes a melee attack against you, before being hit, if your speed isn't 0, you can move 5 feet away from the foe without triggering opportunity attacks, potentially avoiding the attack if you leave its range.
	You can use this invocation a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

    <text>Prerequisite: Pact of the Trigger feature

Your shots are like a rain of lead. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a cantrip you cast with your hex gun, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

    <text>Prerequisite: 7th level, Pact of the Trigger feature

Until the end of your turn, you enhance your hex gun. When you hit a creature with a cantrip cast with your hex gun, you can immediately cause the hit to wound a second creature within 15 feet of the original target. The second target takes damage (of the type of the cantrip) equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
	You can use this invocation to enhance your hex gun a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

When an enemy attacks you with a melee attack, you can fire a special bullet to counter it as a reaction before being hit. Make a melee or ranged spell attack. On a hit, the enemy takes 1d10 force damage, its attack fails, and it is stunned until the end of its current turn.
	Once you've used this invocation to damage an enemy, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
