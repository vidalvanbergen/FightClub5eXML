      <name>Description</name>
      <text>An odd cousin of dragonborn, the dragontortleborn combine the best attributes of dragons, humanoids, and turtles. Usually mistaken for a particularly fearsome tortle or a shelled dragonborn, dragontortleborn are a rare sight in most worlds. Despite their small numbers, dragontortleborn are every bit as proud as their dragonborn cousins. While the dragonborn make their wars on land, dragontortleborn carve out territory in the sea.

    <trait><name>Languages</name><text>You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</text></trait>
    <trait><name>Amphibious</name><text>You can breathe air and water.</text></trait>
    <trait><name>Breath Weapon</name>
      <text>You can use your action to exhale scalding hot steam in a 15 foot cone.</text>
      <text>    When you use your breath weapon, each creature within the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. Being underwater doesn’t grant resistance to this damage. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</text>
      <text>    After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</text></trait>
    <trait><name>Natural Armor</name><text>Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier does not affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield’s bonus as normal.</text></trait>
