  <description>Inside the the Book of Uncommon Ancestry you'll find a treasure trove of new player options related to some of the rarer peoples of the D&amp;D multiverse. It features 12 new player character races, new weapons used mainly by giff and thri-kreen adventurers, over 30 new racial feats, and 48 new magic items. New races explored in the Book include:

	• Book wyrms are small, winged draconic bibliovores that immediately learn the content of any book or written document they consume.
	• Dhampir are the cursed offspring of a mortal and a vampire. They can walk in sunlight, though they typically avoid doing so, and often find themselves rejected by the living and dead alike.
	• Dragontortleborn are the unlikely humanoid offspring of dragonturtles. Often mistaken for odd-looking dragonborn or particularly ferocious tortles, the dragontortleborn are a proud militant people.
	• Giff are spacefaring, hippopotamus-headed gunpowder enthusiasts with a mercenary military hierarchy government.
	• Godblooded are the children of mortals and gods. A godblooded may look like their mortal parent but they inherit some of the divine resilience and blessings of their holy, or unholy, parent.
	• Grimalkin are a race of house cat-like humanoids who live in itinerant communities after having been expelled from the Feywild and Shadowfell for taking a war of pranks too far.
	• Half-dwarves are the dwarven equivalents of half-elves. Like half-elves, they often struggle to be accepted fully by their human and non-human kin.
	• Lemurians were once a human civilization but generations in the Deep Ethereal, working reality-shaping magic, left its mark on them.
	• Lupin are divided into two subraces: the ferocious, wolf-like hutaakan and the genial, dog-like renardy.
	• Saurian are an ancient race of dinosaur-folk who claim to have once ruled the world. Today, what remains of their empire is in ruins and they must choose between clinging to the traditions of the past and forging a new future for their people.
	• Shardmind are crystalline beings, each a sentient shard of the Living Gate that once separated the Far Realms from the rest of the multiverse.
	• Thri-kreen are a mantis-like people who live short and sleepless existences of hunting and gathering in the hottest regions of the world.</description>
