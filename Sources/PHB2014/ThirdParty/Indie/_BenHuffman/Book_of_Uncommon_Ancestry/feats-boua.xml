    <text>When angered, you radiate menace. You gain the following benefits:

	• Increase your Strength or Constitution or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

	• Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait to roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

    <text>As you've matured, many of your natural defenses and aptitudes mutated, making you even more dangerous than your peers. You gain the following benefits:

	• Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

	• You have retractable claws at the ends of your fingers that you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

	• The AC granted by your Natural Armor racial trait increases to 18.

	• You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
