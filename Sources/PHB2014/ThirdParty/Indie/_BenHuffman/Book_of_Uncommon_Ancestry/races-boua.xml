      <name>Description</name>
      <text>An odd cousin of dragonborn, the dragontortleborn combine the best attributes of dragons, humanoids, and turtles. Usually mistaken for a particularly fearsome tortle or a shelled dragonborn, dragontortleborn are a rare sight in most worlds. Despite their small numbers, dragontortleborn are every bit as proud as their dragonborn cousins. While the dragonborn make their wars on land, dragontortleborn carve out territory in the sea.

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Big Snappers</name>
      <text>Like their cousins, dragontortleborn hatch from eggs. Instead of being reared by their elders, dragontortleborn form pods with their peers upon hatching. These groups travel and learn together until their adulthood, when they are considered worthy of joining larger dragontortleborn society. Many dragontortleborn do not survive through their adolescence as a result of this practice.
	Those who do grow to be between 5 and 6 feet tall. While they are relatively average in terms of height amongst other humanoids, they are broad and their large armored shells add additional girth and weight. Dragontortleborn weigh no less than 500 pounds and often more. While their turtle-like shape may not make them graceful, the dragontortleborn's physique is capable of carrying an enormous amount of additional weight.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>A Culture of Honor</name>
      <text>Due to the way infant dragontortleborn are raised, their culture is disjointed and changes dramatically as new pods age into adults. While there are few traditions that bind dragontortleborn together as a whole, they do share an emphasis on personal honor. Although the specifics of what actions and behaviors are honorable vary between pods, dragontortleborn broadly understand honor as exhibiting military strength, stoicism, patience, and conviction.
	Like dragon turtles, dragontortleborn highly prize wealth. While most dragontortleborn prefer to live as warriors who plunder their treasure from fallen adversaries, some become merchants specializing in arranging trade between sea and land-based peoples. A vault of gold and jeweled ornaments may be the only thing dragontortleborn respect as much as personal honor.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>By Fin or Sail</name>
      <text>Dragontortleborn are covetous of wealth, keen to test themselves in battle, and fiercely protective of their personal honor. For all these reasons, dragontortleborn are as likely to stick with their own kind as they are to adventure with others. Dragontortleborn form underwater conclaves defeating other underwater races like sahuagin and tritons or, more rarely, form pirate companies, stealing all they can from seafaring, landborn peoples. When their clans are at peace, or there is little maritime traffic to harrass, dragontortleborn may turn to adventuring to pursue their love of honor, conflict, and money. Some dragontortleborn become adventurers to nurture these appetites in a positive direction.</text>

      <name>Dragontortleborn Names</name>
      <text>Throughout a dragontortleborn's childhood and adolescence, they use a series of nicknames given to them by their podmates. Upon reaching adulthood, a dragontortleborn is either given or decides a name for themselves that will be used for the remainder of their life. Adult dragontortleborn take offense to being called anything other than their adult name, except in the case of podmates who may continue to use childhood nicknames.

      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Like their dragonborn cousins, dragontortleborn develop quickly. They are capable of surviving on their own within hours of hatching and reach adulthood by the age of 10. They live to be around 70.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Dragontortleborn are motivated primarily, though not entirely, by self-interest. Most dragontortleborn are neutral with some being evil and a few being good. They have no natural inclination towards law or chaos.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Size</name>
      <text>Dragontortleborn are stout creatures relative to their height. You stand between 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh around 500 pounds. Your size is Medium.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Speed</name>
      <text>Your base walking speed is 30, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Amphibious</name>
      <text>You can breathe air and water.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="species">
      <name>Breath Weapon</name>
      <text>You can use your action to exhale scalding hot steam in a 15 foot cone. When you use your breath weapon, each creature within the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance to this damage. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
	After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</text>

    <trait category="species">
      <name>Natural Armor</name>
      <text>Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier does not affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Languages</name>
      <text>You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</text>
