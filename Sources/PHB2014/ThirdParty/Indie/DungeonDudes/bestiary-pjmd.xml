    <description>The grim-faced doctor's jaw tightens as they lower their brow and sigh. Suddenly, their face contorts into a wicked, impossible grimace, a smile stretched too wide for the muscles on their face. Fiendish light glimmers in their eyes as hornlike bulges rip through the flesh of their forehead. Profane runes suddenly blaze upon their flesh, releasing the smell of burning meat and sulfur. The body rises into the air, the muscle spasms barely containing the evil spirit bound within this mortal host. A spiral of flame encircles the apothecary's body as they unleash a horrific scream, speaking in a voice which is not their own. "Now, you will die, mortal."

Desperate Gambit. A Soulbound Host (Fiendish, Faerie or Aberrant) is usually created under truly desperate circumstances, such as when a heroic apothecary faces a dangerous otherworldly being such as a demon, fey, spirit, or inscrutable entity from the Space Between Worlds. Not only are these planar invaders pernicious foes, many are effectively immortal—often these creatures simply reform when killed outside their native planes. Thus, an apothecary who lacks the ability to defeat the demon on their own, or who wishes to defeat a powerful outsider in a more permanent fashion, may instead decide upon a heroic act of self-sacrifice by turning themselves into a Soulbound Host.

Preparing the Trap. Using an array of implanted metals, ingested tinctures, mental preparations, and occult incantations, a skilled apothecary may willingly prepare their body for possession. During the process, the apothecary can weave a unique spiritual trap. It then falls to the apothecary to convince the otherworldly creature to possess them, an act that many outsiders are eager to do. Thus, the canny apothecary preys on the ego of the monster itself.

Mortal Curse. When the outsider inhabits the body, the apothecary's soul departs, leaving the extraplanar creature to take their place spiritually. If this mortal form is killed or destroyed, the bound creature does not simply return to their plane of origin. Instead, the spirit departs to the afterworlds
like any other mortal soul, losing their accumulated otherworldly power forever. Thus, the Soulbound Host becomes both a prison and a death sentence for the other wielding being tricked into the apothecary's body.

Rogue Hosts. Unfortunately, this act of self-sacrifice is not without its imperfections. The apothecary's body is filled with otherworldly essence, and while the creature's power is greatly diminished, they often remain extremely dangerous—allies of the departed apothecary may still find it challenging to slay the Soulbound Host. Many escape, wandering the world with stolen lives and even assuming the identity of their host while they search for the means to escape their now mortal form. All bound outsiders are painfully aware of their new mortality, frustrated that returning to their planes of origin is not a simple matter of destroying their flesh-cage or switching their essence into a different host, one which lacks the binding wards placed by the apothecary.

Price of Freedom. Trapped outsiders can win their freedom by calling back the soul of the apothecary who trapped them, and resurrecting them into their body. This is a thing many outsiders are loathe to do out of fiendish ego, since it puts the original soul in a bargaining position. In this way, the apothecary can force the spirit to accept a bargain which requires them to remain in their own worlds for at least the duration of the apothecary's lifetime.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Religion, Medicine, or Survival gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Soulbound Host, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Possessed Body. You know the Soulbound Host's type and damage Resistances.
(15+) Extraplanar Magic. Depending on the type of spirit, you learn either the Hellfire Chain, Illusory Assault, or Psychic Barrage actions, as well as the Spellcasting trait of the host.
(20+) Cursed Fate. You recognize its desperation caused by its spirit-bound mortality and its Reactions.

Combat Tactics
A Soulbound Host is a careful combatant. Though powerful, the last thing they want is to be killed in their mortal form. If they are seriously injured, they often attempt to bargain, offering power and knowledge to assailants who spare them.

Academy Combat Tactics
Broadly speaking, Amethyst Academy mages eschew combat, valuing their own lives too highly to take such risks. They view themselves as researchers, craftspeople, and scholars, not war mages—few bother learning damaging spells beyond simple cantrips, instead focusing on practical magic for their academic and industrial pursuits. Nevertheless, they know that magic is still a dangerous vocation, and ready themselves to flee perilous situations with Invisibility spells or teleportation magic.
    When violent confrontation seems inevitable, Amethyst Academy agents often hire mercenaries or adventurers, or dispatch summoned creatures in their stead. Nevertheless, there are bold explorers who take to field research and prepare themselves for dangerous expeditions—particularly, those who personally study the ruins of Drakkenheim. They often utilize constructs such as Shield Guardians or summoned elementals bound to service with Planar Binding. Mages usually begin combat with defensive or control spells as befits the situation, such as taking to the air with Fly or subduing foes with Slow. Only once they are certain the situation is under control will they use their signature Prismatic Blasts or area-of-effect spells like Fireball and Lightning Bolt. These mages almost always flee once they've become Bloodied, viewing a temporary setback or mission failure as a preferable outcome over their deaths.

    <description>This unearthly dragon is a crystalline horror, its body formed from angular gem-like scales pulsing with octarine light. Its form is raw delerium. Each scale is a gleaming crystal refracting light into eerie hues of purple, yellow, and green, with an unnatural sharpness that feels both fragile and impossibly durable.
    The dragon's wings are translucent and webbed with glowing crystal veins that shimmer, casting kaleidoscopic patterns as it moves. Each beat causes the air to hum, vibrating with a chaotic energy that overwhelms and distorts the senses. Each step the dragon takes leaves delicate motes of crystal growing into jagged formations, tainting the landscape. Its eyes are like multifaceted gems, swirling with chaotic magic pooling within their depths. 
    The beast's crystalline horns and talons are razor-sharp, gleaming like polished jewels, yet crackling with eldritch energy.

A fully mature Delerium Dragon establishes its own domain within the Space Between Worlds, finding a place suitable to its temperament. There it seeks to understand itself and the world around it.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Delerium Dragon, learning the following based on the result.
(15+) Empowered by Eldritch Magic. You understand the dragon's Resistances and senses.
(20+) Octarine Breath. You recognize the effects of the Delerium Dragon's breath weapon, as well as noting its Spellcasting capabilities.
(25+) Few Weaknesses. You learn its highest and lowest saving throws. 

Combat Tactics
A Delerium Dragon views combat less as a violent encounter and more as a chance to change foes into a new form. It darts about using flight and teleportation, seldom remaining in the same place for more than a turn. Their movement makes it easy for the dragon to find the perfect place to catch many enemies with its breath weapon. Delerium Dragons love to spread contamination and cause arcane anomalies, and delight causing monstrous transformations with their contaminated attacks. 
    Delerium Dragons use their Bite, Contaminated Rend, and Tail attacks to tear opponents apart in between uses of their breath weapon. When they are unable to close the distance, Delerium Dragons mentally assault their targets with Mindfire.

Harvestable Components (Very Rare)
Animus: Aberration. Fluid: Monster Blood, Contaminated Ichor. Organs: Eyes, Heart, Brain, Guts, Glands, Flesh. Bones: Skull, Spine, Ribs. Natural Weapons: Claws, Teeth. Hide: Scales, Webbed Membrane. Dust: Aberrant Dust. 
Delerium. In addition, characters can collect delerium crystals from its body. An adult has 2d6 crystals.

It is shovelling chunks of horse-flesh into itself, and giggling as it swallows the ripped flesh. Whatever passes for arms, on the inside of the palm are yellow eyes.

Combat Tactics
The Agog barrels towards its enemies, flailing its arms towards them and attempting to grab them and toss them to the ground. If it knocks a creature down, it will immediately begin attempting to devour them.

Alienist Minions. 
Alienists keep several experiments of their own on hand. They have been known to keep Wretched Patients, their minds melted by the Alienist's inhuman experimentation, turning them into obedient and loyal servants. Disembodied Psyches and Cerebrografts are a few of their higher-end creations, having removed the brain of a creature and given it a unique and bespoke form of sentience, these creatures serve as guards to an Alienist's work, or minions capable of complex thought and aid.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I can't help but analyze every person who comes before me. I want to know what they think, and why they are the way they are.
• Bond. I study the mind for scientific advancement. How easily this muscle can be manipulated, altered, and used in unforeseen ways is fascinating research that must be explored.
• Ideal. I am the only one capable of this level of advanced mental research, someone else would have gotten it wrong!
• Flaw. My unbound intellect means that I can never be fooled, tricked, or manipulated, and thus I can never be out-smarted, to think I could is laughable.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine or Arcana gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study an Alienist, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Mental Master. You are aware of the Alienist's Immunities as well as its Unmatched Intellect trait.
(15+) Mind Control. You know of its Mass Manipulation action.
(20+) Brilliant but Vulnerable. You learn its AC, as well as its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
An Alienist is a smart combatant who does not wildly use their abilities, nor easily fall victim to manipulation or deception. They begin interactions by attempting to persuade foes to leave them be, resorting to spells such as Suggestion and Detect Thoughts to help navigate social encounters. If combat arises, the Alienist unleashes Mass Manipulation to confuse its foes while it Teleports away to make an escape. The Alienist leaves Nerve Gas in its wake to dissuade enemies from pursuit.
    The Alienist flees at the first opportunity it has—they are too clever to give in to needless combat. If the Alienist is trapped, it does its best to undo the party, attempting to flee at all costs if it feels it is in a losing situation and below half its Hit Points.

      <text>The Amalgamation always takes its turn on initiative count 20. On its turn, the Amalgamation can use its movement and interaction as normal. However, it does not take an action or Bonus Action on its turn unless forced to do so by a spell or other effect. Instead, the Amalgamation takes one of the following Epic Actions at the end of each player character's turn:</text>
    </action>
    <action>
      <name>Bite</name>
      <text>Melee Attack Roll: +17, reach 10 ft. Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) Force damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature Grappled by the Amalgamation, the grapple ends and the target is swallowed. While swallowed, the target has the Blinded and Restrained conditions, has Total Cover from effects originating from outside the Amalgamation, and takes 42 (12d6) Necrotic damage and gains a Contamination level at the start of each of the Amalgamation's turns. 
    If the Amalgamation takes 50+ damage in a single turn from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which land in spaces within 10 feet of the Amalgamation and have the Prone condition. If the Amalgamation dies, a swallowed creature no longer has the Restrained condition and can escape the corpse using 15 feet of its movement, exiting with the Prone condition.</text>

    <description>Before the throne is a gibbering amalgamation of fleshy tumors, rotting bones, and rancid layers of bloated fat suspended between the ceiling and floor by stalky strands of gnarled tissue. A palpable aura of contamination emanates from the beast. The mass is covered in bursting sores and shuddering mucus nodules that weep bile and delerium sludge. The creature mutters in alien tongues from six yawning mouths, piping and sputtering in discordant musical tones, and lazily shifting eyes of massive size open and close throughout its bulk. Thick trunk-like tentacles reach out from its hideous stinking form to squirm and writhe around the chamber. Several appendages are wrapped around pulsing human organs: lungs, liver, kidney, a heart, a brain, and dangling amongst them is the jeweled Crown of Westemär.

Study the Foe:
Characters who have one or more mutations, or who are afflicted with any form of madness gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study the Amalgamation, learning the following based on the result:
(20+) Multidimensional. You recognize its Immunities, and its Rejuvenation, Malignancy, and Immutable Form traits.
(25+) Insatiable Hunger. You know of the creature's Bite attack, as well as its Mind-Breaking Whispers ability.
(30+) Beyond Comprehension. You are aware of its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics:
The Amalgamation is a formidable foe capable of grappling multiple targets and eating them or throwing them around the battlefield. It constantly summons Pyknic Maunders as additional support while it uses Mind-Breaking Whispers to shatter the minds of its greatest threats.
    The Amalgamation does not fear any mortal creature, believing itself indestructible to mortal means. It does not flee or cower.

    <description>This unearthly dragon is a crystalline horror, its body formed from angular gem-like scales pulsing with octarine light. Its form is raw delerium. Each scale is a gleaming crystal refracting light into eerie hues of purple, yellow, and green, with an unnatural sharpness that feels both fragile and impossibly durable.
    The dragon's wings are translucent and webbed with glowing crystal veins that shimmer, casting kaleidoscopic patterns as it moves. Each beat causes the air to hum, vibrating with a chaotic energy that overwhelms and distorts the senses. Each step the dragon takes leaves delicate motes of crystal growing into jagged formations, tainting the landscape. Its eyes are like multifaceted gems, swirling with chaotic magic pooling within their depths. 
    The beast's crystalline horns and talons are razor-sharp, gleaming like polished jewels, yet crackling with eldritch energy.

Perhaps older than the cosmos itself, Ancient Delerium Dragons possess knowledge and memories of worlds and eons which have passed, many more which never were, and countless which cannot be. Their very presence warps the world around them according to their whims. 

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Delerium Dragon, learning the following based on the result.
(15+) Empowered by Eldritch Magic. You understand the dragon's Resistances and senses.
(20+) Octarine Breath. You recognize the effects of the Delerium Dragon's breath weapon, as well as noting its Spellcasting capabilities.
(25+) Few Weaknesses. You learn its highest and lowest saving throws. 

Combat Tactics
A Delerium Dragon views combat less as a violent encounter and more as a chance to change foes into a new form. It darts about using flight and teleportation, seldom remaining in the same place for more than a turn. Their movement makes it easy for the dragon to find the perfect place to catch many enemies with its breath weapon. Delerium Dragons love to spread contamination and cause arcane anomalies, and delight causing monstrous transformations with their contaminated attacks. 
    Delerium Dragons use their Bite, Contaminated Rend, and Tail attacks to tear opponents apart in between uses of their breath weapon. When they are unable to close the distance, older Delerium Dragons mentally assault their targets with Mindfire.

    <description>A colossal snail as wide as a city street with a shell the size of a small house glides slowly into view. Its shell has a kaleidoscopic fractal shimmer, projecting hues of unknown colors that swirl in incomprehensible patterns. As it moves, its shell seems to refract light in ways that seem nonsensical or wrong. You must strain your eyes to look at it wriggle towards you. Its bulbous head ends in two long antennae each holding a small octarine eye. Slimy mucus drips off its flesh, leaving sizzling trails and corroding anything it touches.

    <description>A perfect physical form of humanity stands before you, its flawlessly formed and muscle-bound flesh is tinted in a golden hue while its veins bulge and glow with octarine light. Their eyes emit cascades of light and their voice is a booming chorus. As swirls of fire, ice, and electricity crackle around them, they pulse with unbound energy.

Perfect Transmogrification. Amongst Mutagenists, the quest for genetic perfection can become an all-consuming obsession. Those who seek to achieve this so-called superior state refer to it as the "Apex" and describe the transformation as creating the ultimate humanoid specimen.
    Through years of study and trials, Mutagenists have perfected their Transmogrifying Elixir to harness the ultimate power of mortal potential. This formula allows them to amplify their natural capabilities to the peak physical form while maintaining their unbound intellect. There is no telling how many long years a Mutagenist has spent in their lab, and how many unwilling test subjects had to suffer the fates of their imperfect formulae before they arrived at the ultimate conclusion of their research. This is the pinnacle of their scientific study, the perfected Transmogrifying Elixir: the Apex Formula.

Permanent Transformation.The process renders the Mutagenist permanently altered. Energy courses through their veins, their strength and agility extended to the very limits of human capabilities. Their form is able to shift and adapt to incoming threats, and they are able to perceive events around them with great precision. Their mind, although it remains intellectually intact by the process, is inherently and irrevocably shattered. No Mutagenist who takes the Apex Formula could ever perceive or admit to the fracturing of their mind. Regardless of their vast intelligence, a sickening madness takes hold of their psyche; one that plunges the apothecary-turned-Apex creature into a hostile, madness-filled rage. They still hold onto the threads of their vast scientific mind, using that as a justification for their actions, unaware of the deranged mental state they now reside within.

The Folly of Perfection. Even Mutagenists who achieve the Apex state have a gnawing question in the back of their minds: is it truly enough? Could they become even more? Their seemingly perfect form is not without subtle flaws, broken psyche, and weaknesses. Many Mutagenists can never truly be satisfied with their results, and even the Apex Formula can never fulfill the unattainable desire for absolute perfection. It is this obsession that has led many Mutagenists to lunacy in the face of their achievements. For even an Apex may spend eternity bound to their workshop, kidnapping unwilling subjects to continue to test and experiment, seeking a perfection that will never truly be achieved.

Roleplaying Traits
h Personality Trait. I am humanity perfected! All beings are beneath me, for I am the apex of physical existence. All should cower in my glory!
h Bond. Science has granted us this gift! This research is the most valuable scientific discovery in the world and must be protected!
h Ideal. Do not try and stop me, for I am offering perfection to all of humanity. Can't you see? The Apex Form will cure the world of all sickness, all flaws, all weakness!
h Flaw. There cannot be a weakness in my design. If there is, I will solve it — I just need more time!

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine, Survival, or Arcana gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study the Apex. , learning the following based on the result:
(15+) Adapts to Threats. You recognize the Apex's Rapid Adaptation Reaction and Regeneration trait.
(20+) Harness the Elements. You are aware of its Bonus Action attacks.
(25+) Perfect Form but Fragile Mind. You know the Apex's weakness to Necrotic and Psychic damage.

Combat Tactics
The Apex will often be accompanied by several abominations of its own creation. Lab assistants, failed experiments, and Wretched Patients are often by its side.
    An Apex begins combat by unleashing one of its Bonus Action attacks. It quickly analyzes the battlefield, looking for the most optimal use of its energy. It observes the arrangement of its enemies and decides if it is best to use its lightning, fire, or cold attack based on what will deliver the most damage to the most targets.
    It then uses its speed to move close to a target to smash it with its Slam attacks. The Apex prefers to target Frozen enemies with its Slams.
    The Apex is unwilling to see its own flaws, but it is not stupid. If reduced below 60 Hit Points, it unleashes a final attack and attempts to distance itself from its enemies, hoping to escape and recuperate.

    <description>"None without this blood within may strike you down, and by this blood you shall not die."
— Prophecy uttered during the Sanguine Rite

Covered in the gore exploded from his regal form, Vladimir von Drakken has become a hulking monstrosity. Now twelve feet tall, his upper frame is hunched over, and his arms support him like a gorilla. Spiked bones and frilled fins emerge from his arms and his clawed hands are large enough to crush skulls. Bladed scythes and spikes sprout from great batlike wings. The remains of his armor and cloak hang over his swelling new form. Bony protrusions jut from his head like a demonic crown. His once-imperial countenance is gone, replaced by a beastly face, a cross between wolf, bat, and dragon. Trickling blood and sweat, he breathes heavily between grunts, growls, and roars, barely uttering a sentence without howling.

In his Ascendant form, Vladimir von Drakken is truly a monster. Once he ascends to this form, he savagely attacks anyone he sees, including his own underlings.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. Vladimir speaks with vile overconfidence, a sinister smirk, and a demeanor of a creature who believes himself a god, he does not tolerate others treating him as any less than a king of kings.
• Bond. Vladimir will stop at nothing to conquer the continent and reclaim his throne in Drakkenheim. He made it, and it is his to rule, any other who attempts to sit upon it is an imposter.
• Ideal. "This realm belongs to the dead, and the dead shall keep it. Any who stand in the way of my reign will join my legions by choice, or by force."
• Flaw. Vladimir believes himself entirely indestructible and is blind to the loopholes within the rites that created him. Nevertheless, he is hesitant to trust anyone. He refuses to let anyone get close and assumes everyone is plotting against him.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Religion gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when taking the Study action to examine Vladimir von Drakken, learning the following based on the result:
(15+) Deadly Foe. You know of the creature's Resistances and Immunities.
(20+) Renowned Swordsman. You are aware of his Bloodmourne and Bite attacks.
(25+) Nearly Undefeatable. You recognize his Reborn or Ascendent Transformation trait.

Combat Tactics
Vladimir von Drakken is presented here in three forms. As the Ascendent Vampire grows in power he transforms into a new form until he returns to his full strength.
    If he is successfully resurrected with the Sanguine Rite, Vladimir von Drakken first begins in his Crypt-Starved form. He remains in this form until he consumes the blood of a living descendant of House von Drakken, which enables him to turn into his Reborn form.
    If reduced to 0 Hit Points in his Reborn form, Vladimir von Drakken unleashes his Ascendant form.
    In his Crypt-Starved form, Vladimir von Drakken is a craven and desperate combatant. He primarily aims to drink as much blood as possible using his Bite to transform into his Reborn form. He makes use of Shadow Step and Terrifying Glare to reposition himself and hold foes at bay.
    Once he regains his Reborn form, Vladimir von Drakken is nearly unstoppable. He wades into melee with Bloodmourne, demonstrating his martial superiority by using his manoeuvres. He uses his Claws and Bite as finishing moves and uses Dominate to bend his foes to his will. When surrounded, he uses Wing Blast to reposition.
    Assuming his Ascendant form, Vladimir von Drakken becomes an engine of bloodlust and destruction, fueled by primal rage and undead power. In this form, he rips foes apart with melee attacks and flays their spirits whenever his Soul Rend becomes available.

Slaying Vladimir von Drakken
Vladimir cannot be fully destroyed unless he is wholly unmade at the place he was first transformed. Wholly destroying Vladimir von Drakken is difficult. Once he is defeated in combat, with the final blow struck by one who shares his blood, his heart must be cut out, and placed upon the altar within the Standing Stones in in the Brachenwald where he was transformed into a vampire.Under a full moon at midnight, a wooden stake made from a branch from Elenthas the Evertree must be driven through the heart by one of his blood descendants. Then, the heart must be left there until sunrise where it is destroyed by first light. Vladimir von Drakken's minions do not stand idly whilst this happens, and launch a massive assault upon the grove with the desperate aim of retrieving his heart before it is destroyed by the sun.

    <description>Two insectoid legs hold up the beetle-like creature, rhythmically clacking as it skitters about. Two clawed arms scrabble beneath blade-like limbs as gnashing mandibles chitter under its beady eyes. A massive pincer-like horn protrudes from its helmet-shaped head and a tough blueish-silver shell protects delicate wings hidden beneath.

Study the Foe

When damaged, Belfrays Bite, feeding on the blood of their victims to regain strength. It uses movement to stay away from threats, diving to attack before flying to a safe distance. If reduced below half of its maximum Hit Points, it attempts to fly away.

(20+) Big, Clumsy, and Dumb. You recognize Big Linda's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Big Linda sends Acid Spew against groups of opponents. She then tries to optimize her Bite and Tail attacks by placing herself within her enemies. She is hesitant to leave the Deep Haze but is also not smart enough to resist chasing those who are antagonizing her. She rarely flees unless severely wounded, wherein she will seek the safety of the Deep Haze to recover.

    <description>Thundering through the streets of Drakkenheim with a crash, the infamous pet of the Queen of Thieves has mutated and enlarged to unfathomable proportions. The Haze swirls around it, and octarine energy pulses in its sunken eye sockets. The broken hafts of weapons and old arrows are embedded into its scales, stuck deeply between its regenerated flesh. Its spined back is illuminated by webs of glowing octarine veins; its wide snout is filled with jagged teeth. As it opens its maw wide, the building contaminated energy at the back of its throat begins to glow.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I can always make a deal with the right angle, I just gotta pitch it the right way. I don't give up when the mark doesn't take the bait, just try something new!
• Ideal. We're all in this for ourselves. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
• Bond. Listen, I got some close connections with some powerful people. You wanna meet the Queen of Thieves? Stick with me. We'll go places together. Just uh, watch out you don't piss anyone off, okay?
• Flaw. I'm a compulsive liar, so what? Yeah, sometimes even I get confused by my own lies, but the truth can always do with a little exaggeration, it makes life more interesting!

Combat Tactics
Blackjack Mel is a coward, a swindler, and a thief. He is often surrounded by Thugs and Assassins who protect him; Mel rarely draws a blade. His overconfidence relies on his company, and he will often only take a stab at someone if they are held down.
    Mel's first line of defense is his mouth. He will double-cross, backstab, swindle, and con even his allies to ensure his own survival. He knows a lot of information about a lot of things and will use his well of secrets to bargain for his safety. He is also clever and will usually only divulge half of a fact to save his life, ensuring the other half will be granted once his safety is ensured. He knows very well that information is what keeps him alive, and he isn't about to use up that usefulness.
    Mel flees without question at any opportunity if he feels threatened, and often keeps a Potion of Invisibility on his person for just such instances.

    <description>A gurgling moan emerges from the dark as the slopping footsteps of a bloated form emerges. Its rippling, sagging flesh is wet and dripping. Its rotund face and soggy skin are covered in boils, blisters, and leaking sores. Wet, acidic saliva dribbles down its chin, leaving trails of burned flesh. The Dreg's one arm is a mass of writhing slick tentacles. As its mouth opens, a low gurgling sound slowly builds.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Bloated Dreg, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Corrupted by Contaminated Water. You know the creature is an Aberration with a Swim speed, and it can breathe underwater.
(10+) Slow and Polluted. You recognize the Bloated Dreg's Acid Spray attack.
(15+) Mockery of Humanity. You are aware of the Bloated Dreg's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Bloated Dreg shuffles aimlessly through Drakkenheim, stopping to rest in places where contaminated water has built up, or in pools of delerium sludge. It produces large amounts of acidic bile in its guts that it expels when threatened. A Bloated Dreg will retreat to its watery home when threatened, trying to hide amongst the contaminated liquids.

Harvestable Components (Common)
Animus: Aberration. Fluid: Monster Blood, Contaminated Ichor, Acidic Bile. Organs: Eyes, Heart, Brain, Guts, Flesh. Bones: Skull, Spine, Ribs. Hair: Hair. Hide: Skin. Dust: Aberrant Dust.

(10+) Endless insects! You are aware of the creature's Spawn Swarm action and Disrupt the Hive trait.
(15+) Frail. You recognize the Bloated Hive's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Bloated Hive is usually a solitary creature that spends its time cowering in dark corners living out its cursed life as nothing more than a conduit for its colony. In combat, they focus entirely on keeping their distance from threats and spawning swarms of insects to defend themselves. If cornered, the Bloated Hive uses its Claws and Distracting Swarm before moving back into the shadows and attempting to escape and find a new nest.
    Larger packs of Bloated Hives are much braver and more violent, and actively hunt and pursue targets until their numbers are less than their prey. Places where large colonies gather are dangerous. The Bloated Hives work in unison to protect their nests. Only if they become outnumbered do they flee.

Harvestable Components (Uncommon)

    <description>The black, plump wriggling form of the leech squirms and crawls. Its oily, slick skin is wet and slippery. It lets out a high-pitched screech as it lunges towards its prey.

Although the practice of draining a patient's blood to draw out illness and disease is long discredited, many apothecaries understand the value of transfusing blood during surgical procedures. However, storing the blood long term can be a problem. Apothecaries have solved by modifying normal leeches with occult science, transforming the creatures into living blood bags. While these bloodletting techniques are of dubious therapeutic value to patients, they make an effective method for collecting samples from less-than-willing subjects.
    Though often benign in nature, these bloated leeches can be turned to violent purpose by an apothecary willing to use the creatures in such a manner. During combat, an apothecary may dispatch the leeches against their foes, then call the creatures back to themselves to heal using their foe's blood.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a leech, learning the following based on the result: 
(10+) Quick Swimmers. You know the leech's Swim speed and senses.
(15+) Blood Transfer. You know of the Blood Leech's Blood Drain and Blood Infusion.

Combat Tactics
Leeches attempt to get close to a target to Bite and Attach to them. They do not retreat, as they are driven by their basic need to feed on the blood of others and nothing else.

    <description>This patchwork monster of stitched-together corpses oozes black ichor from its seams. The figure is a hulking form, about 7 feet tall with broad shoulders and a hunched back. Its head seems small compared to its body, with pale white eyes highlighting sunken dark sockets. A lipless mouth forces the creature into a constant menacing grimace. Draped in a thick black trench coat and wide brimmed hat while smelling of sulfur and brimstone, the unsettling humming and mumbling of the creature echoes in the ears of those it is about to grab. The most unsettling feature is the creature's four arms, which end in massive, oversized hands, each with eight long, spindly fingers. The creature shifts from shadow to shadow effortlessly, in a haunting ghost-like fashion unusual for its size.

Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Body Snatcher, learning the following based on the result:

(20+) In the Dark of Night. You recognize the Body Snatcher's Sunlight Weakness trait.

Combat Tactics
The Body Snatcher sticks to dimly lit areas or places of complete darkness. It teleports up to a creature and attempts to grapple it, teleporting away as soon as it has one or two targets in its hands. Often the Body Snatcher will emerge from tunnels or secret entrances to its lair. They do not travel far from the labs they were created in and often have easy points of escape to disappear once they have a victim in hand.

    <description>This creature, which appears to be a dead horse flopped on its back, convulses and its stomach suddenly splits open, exposing its intestines and organs. Long, spindly, arachnid-like legs violently sprout from its torso as its stomach opens into a maw filled with sharp jagged teeth formed from the splayed rib cage of the beast. The horse legs limply hang in the air, as the creature skitters towards you with intense speed, intestines flapping around its maw like a sickly tongue. The head of the horse dangles lifelessly, but its mouth still gnashes and salivates acidic bile.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Bojack, learn the following based on their result:
(10+) Parasitic Mutation. You recognize the BoJack's Immunities and senses.
(15+) Acidic Ambusher. You're aware of the creature's Corrosive Mucus and Impaling Limbs attacks.
(20+) Fast and Cunning. You know the Bojack's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Bojack is an ambush skirmisher. It waits for the opportune moment to strike, attempting to surprise as many targets as possible. After it surprises its prey, it attacks with its Impaling Limbs or Corrosive Mucus and uses its Predatory Cunning to move out of melee range.
    The Bojack can climb walls and will try and skitter up buildings or behind walls, springing back out to attack before escaping again. If brought below 20 Hit Points, the BoJack attempts to Dash away and Hide.

    <description>The Cacophonous Chimera's three heads include a chittering rat, a screeching harpy, and a howling garmyr, which together perform a madness-inducing chorus as they slaughter their prey. Its forelimbs are clawed rat-like paws, its rear legs are avian talons, and the beast's colossal furry body is borne upon massive wings of blood-red feathers with a slithering lamprey eel for a tail.

Roleplaying Traits
The following traits can be used to inspire roleplaying the Cacophonous Chimera:
• Personality Trait: "Just ONCE can we chat with someone a little before we eat them? RARGH! STOP TALKING! RIP AND TEAR! NO! NO! NO! Our stomach is FOUR TIMES bigger than it used to be! I'm STARVING!"
• Bond: "We're fused together. Although each of us wants to be separated, in truth we're afraid of what would happen if we were ever torn apart."
• Ideal: "I make such wonderful music! Each howl, shriek, and chitter resonates to form a deadly orchestra. I can't stand silence!"
• Flaw: "We're constantly arguing. Our internal strife often distracts us from opportunities or leads us into traps, as we can't agree even on the simplest decisions."

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Cacophonous Chimera, learning the following based on their result:
(15+) Freakish Fusion. You're aware of the chimera's Epic Resistance Epic Action.
(20+) Fighting for Control. You recognize the chimera's Cacophony Epic Action, noting that if the creature could be silenced, it would be far less formidable.
(25+) Powerful but Distracted. You understand its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Desperate to eat and consume, the Cacophonous Chimera viciously attacks prey on sight despite the desires of its harpy head to engage in a little conversation first. The Cacophonous Chimera is not a very subtle hunter. Its prey can hear it coming by the sound of its droning cacophony from at least a city block away, which may give them opportunity to prepare, hide, or flee.
    The range of its Cacophony can affect creatures before they can see the chimera itself. By the time the chimera arrives, its prey may be shaken and immobilized by the sound. Depending on how ravenous and furious it is, the chimera closes with its prey and tears them apart using its Claws, Bite, and Tail.
    Against a target that shows resilience to its cacophony or who retaliates with formidable attacks of their own, the chimera keeps a middle distance, trying to keep out of melee range while leaving its foes in its Cacophonous Chorus aura. However, its ravenous Garmyr head and Ratling head can often get in the way of the better judgment here, prompting the chimera to engage in melee even when it would not be advantageous. Furthermore, the three creatures are generally too busy arguing or overconfident to think twice about the actual danger and stakes they might be facing, and so may need to be grievously wounded before fleeing is an option.

    <description>Given the strange features of this massive, muscled, eight-foot-tall figure, it is difficult to say if it was once human or a troll. Its bruised skin stretches and rips over barely contained muscles. It is pin-headed, with an emotionless face, glassy-eyes, and a slack-jawed maw. Most disturbingly, its ribcage is splayed open, revealing guts and viscera along with a smaller, vestigial creature with wrinkled flesh and a mewling mouth. It holds its sticklike arms and curled fingers close, and its neck can barely hold its massive head. Thin translucent skin covers its huge brain, the blood vessels within softly glowing. Raising its tiny hands to its temples, its eyes bulge and its face contorts into a twisted expression.

Improved Lackeys. A Cerebrograft is often the "reward" granted to a pair of loyal lab assistants, a means of "removing deficiencies" by combining their bodies and minds, frequently named a portmanteau of its constituent beings.

Dominant Personality. Although intended to be a symbiosis of two minds, typically, the implanted creature subsumes the psyche of its host, fully controlling the new form. However, sometimes, the two beings form a constituent mind combining elements of the originals, or even a bicameral mind where the original two debate internally over what action to take.

Delicate Work. Thanks to their psionic abilities, Cerebrografts are well suited to controlling other test subjects. Apothecaries find their precise telekinetic powers especially useful in surgical procedures and laboratory experiments.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Cerebrograft, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Occult Fleshmending. You uncover the Cerebrograft's Dual Minds trait.
(15+) Powerful Psionics. You recognize its Telekinetic Grip and Psychic Crush.
(20+) Powerful, Clumsy, and Slow. You learn the Cerebrograft's ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Despite its physical and psionic might, Cerebrografts prefers fighting alongside allies of its apothecary master. When confronted with multiple foes, it tries to overwhelm their minds using Psychic Crush to escape and find reinforcements.
    A Cerebrograft uses its Telekinetic Grip to hold its enemies, unruly test subjects, and wild experiments at bay. It typically focuses on one target, allowing allies to pummel the Restrained foe. If it can, it uses the environment to its advantage, moving foes to restrain them such as into mancles, cages, or surgery tables.

      <text>The chemist conjures a storm of acid rain in a 20-foot radius, 20-foot tall Cylinder centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. Exposed flames in the area are doused. Chemical pools accumulate in the area and emit thick fumes, rendering it Difficult Terrain and Lightly Obscured. The storm and the pools evaporate after 1 minute. 
    A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is subjected to the following effect. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 17. Failure: 30 (12d4) Acid damage, and the target has the Prone condition. Success: Half damage only.</text>

      <name>Emergency Dose (Bonus Action)</name>
      <text>The chemist administers a restorative poultice to itself or a creature it can see within 5 feet that isn't a Construct or Undead. The target regains 35 (10d6) Hit Points. Once a creature benefits from Emergency Dose, it can't do so again until it finishes a Short or Long Rest.</text>

    <description>The figure is garbed in large safety goggles, an acid-burned thick lab apron, white chemical-stained lab coat, and rubber gloves. The skin on their face is the only visible flesh on them, scarred by bubbling chemical burns.

Chemist Minions. Although Chemists often do not dabble in creating creatures, any apothecary can make use of minions. Simple elementals and oozes can be found in a Chemist's lab. Tankers work as a good lab assistant for administering large amounts of chemical formulae for the scientist, while Living Biohazards are often the failed early experiments of many Chemists. A Chemystral is the ultimate pride and joy of many chemists.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I revel in the chaos and destruction that my concoctions cause, watching the flames and corrosion with maniacal laughter and a crazed gleam in my eyes.
• Ideal. Creativity is born from chaos; the most ground breaking discoveries require pushing boundaries, no matter the dangers involved.
• Bond. I am obsessed with avenging my mentor, who was persecuted by those who feared our knowledge and power.
• Flaw. My obsession with perfecting destructive formulae often leads me to take careless risks, sabotaging my own work and safety. I've burned down my own workshop more times than I can remember, and I'll do it again.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Chemist, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Resistance from Exposure. You know of the Chemist's damage Resistances and Immunities.
(15+) Masters of Compounds. You learn the Chemist's Critical Condition trait and Explosive Compound action.
(20+) Mental, not Physical, Prowess. You are aware of the Chemist's AC and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Chemists opt to start things off with a bang, unleashing their Explosive Concoction on the first round, especially against a grouped together party. They use Acid Rain to create a dangerous zone between them and their enemies and default to unleashing their Chemical Spray on enemies stuck in the difficult area. If a creature closes the distance on the Chemist, they use their Caustic Grip. If they find themselves surrounded or outnumbered in close quarters, they attempt to escape.

Whenever the chemystral enters a creature's space, the creature is subjected to the following effect. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 17. Success: The creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the chemystral. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. 
    Failure: The chemystral enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 35 (10d6) Acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, has the Restrained condition, and takes 35 (10d6) Acid damage at the start of each of the chemystral's turns. The engulfed creature has Total Cover from effects outside the chemystral. When the chemystral moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. 
    The chemystral can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time. An engulfed creature can take an action to escape with a successful DC 17 Strength check, entering a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ooze.</text>

    <description>This massive, undulating chemical ooze shimmers in hues of blue, green, pink, and purple. Its large amorphous form throbs and wobbles as it alters its composition constantly to adapt to its surrounding environments. Everything the blob touches dissolves quickly within its form. The distinct smell of bile and stomach acid surround it.

(20+) Elemental Adaption. You uncover the Chemystral's Elemental Reaction trait.
(25+) Weakness to Cold. You recognize the Chemystral's Cold Vulnerability trait.

Combat Tactics
The Chemystral attempts to Engulf as many victims as it can. It cares little about taking elemental damage and only thinks to retreat if it is consistently taking Cold damage.

    <description>The body and face of this mutated wretch is covered in thick, knobby bone plates that have torn violently through their flesh. The exposed ribs of their chest have fused together into a single plate, forming an armor-like appearance. Past their elbow, the muscle and sinew of their forelimbs hangs limply from their protruding exposed bones, which have been reshaped into long, serrated bone-blades caked with gore.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Chitinous Dreg, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Protective Plates. You recognize the Dreg's AC.
(10+) Pinning Blades. You learn of the creature's Bone Blade attack and No Escape trait.
(15+) Sturdy Foe. You are aware of the Chitinous Dreg's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Chitinous Dregs often charge into the front lines of combat. It positions itself between other Dregs and their foes almost as if it was defending its allies. Chitinous Dregs attempt to draw the combat towards itself at all times, using its Bone Blades to keep the focus on it, and its Sentinel Strike Reaction and No Escape trait to ensure creatures facing it cannot get away. The Chitinous Dreg is a warrior and rarely retreats: it is too enraged with a protective bloodlust when thrust into battle to worry about its own wellbeing.

    <description>Scampering up the wall is a creature the size of a hound. It resembles a mostly hairless squirrel save for its bushy tail and patchy tufts of mottled fur.

It frantically clambers upward, while chittering a maddening chorus with its clacking teeth.

Characters proficient in Animal Handling gain Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks to Study a Chitter, learning the following based on their result:

(10+) Madding Noise. You know of its Chitter attack action.
(15+) Simple Minded. You recognize its mental ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Chitters often attack in a small group. Usually two to three that form a family will stick together. The mutated squirrels have been known to be quite territorial and hostile, even to other Chitter families who try to infringe on their territory. 
    Chitters are excellent climbers, capable of falling a great distance without fear of hurting themselves. It is not uncommon for Chitters to be found in tall buildings, or up on the top floor of ruined houses, or hard-to-reach rooftops or attics. Chitters charge their enemies and leap at them, attempting to disable them with their chittering, and relying on their Claws and Bite. Chitters protect their homes with determined ferocity, but if reduced to less than a third of their Hit Points, they leap and clamber away.

Falling Fire pilgrims give up their possessions and wealth and often carry very little on them. For the most part, common Falling Fire devotees are not equipped to fight. Most members try to avoid combat. Preferring a peaceful approach, they are more reactionary in their tactics and hope most situations do not come to bloodshed. However, Drakkenheim is a dangerous city, and monsters and bandits have attempted to thwart the efforts of the devout worshippers often. Pilgrims have been known to take up clubs, daggers, and any mundane weapons they can find to defend themselves, and often groups of traveling pilgrims are accompanied by armored zealots and spellcasting divine leaders who are ready to protect their flock.

    <description>The earth trembles, vibrating pebbles and dust. A deep rumble wells from below. Suddenly, stone cracks, extruding a titanic wurm.

Its body is covered in muddy purple plates with octarine spines jutting from between. Its hot breath sends octarine slime flying as it dives toward you.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Crater Wurm, learning the following based on their result:
(15+) Subterranean Threat. You know it has Tremorsense and that it creates tunnels when digging through rock.
(20+) Earth Shaker. You're aware of the Crater Wurms' Breach and Bite attacks.
(25+) Blunderous Brute. You recognize the Crater Wurms' strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Crater Wurms disregard other creatures, viewing them as only morsels to consume. All are as the dust of the earth to it—simply food. These wurms understand that creatures they devour often try to flee. Their favored tactic is to remain buried until their Tremorsense detects movement. They then surface with its Breach action, making Bite attacks, swallowing nearby Prone creatures. They dive beneath the ground once at least one creature is swallowed, or if reduced to half its Hit Point maximum.

    <description>The Crimson Countess is a powerful queen of harpies. Her red-feathered wings and deep crimson hair set her apart from the many harpy followers she commands. She is clad is black and gold armor and carries with her a spear that crackles with magical energies. Her hands and feet are black talons with sharp claws. The Crimson Countess is a cunning hunter and territorial to the Clock Tower. She has staked her claim over the center of the city, and hunts the various monsters and misguided faction agents who come close.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine Crimson Countess, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Arcane Resistance. You know of the creature's Immunities.
(10+) Dangerous Talons. You recognize the creature's Pluck trait.
(15+) Bold and Nimble. You are aware of the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
The Countess only leaves her clock tower to join in on hunts with her valkyries, but otherwise she prefers the defendable position at the tower's highest floor. From here any adventurer who makes it past her soldiers and into her lair can easily be grabbed and thrown off the open balconies, falling to their death.
    She is overconfident and will do anything to protect her advantageous position in the city. She only flees if all her minions are dead and she is below 25 Hit Points. If she flees, she will attempt to gather more soldiers and return to reclaim the clock tower at a later date.

Crimson Knights form units with other minions and thralls of their vampire masters. Several Crimson Knights may form an elite guard, or one might be attached to lead a contingent of vampire thralls.
    In battle, Crimson Knights seek out the most formidable melee combatants to meet head on, disarming them with Crackling Smite. They make use of Unholy Smite to prevent their target from healing, and terrorize them using Wrathful Smite.
    A Crimson Knight will give their undead existence to defend their master and hold fast even as they are cut down. If they encounter a foe capable of dealing Radiant damage, they make them the target of their attacks to ensure they can continue to regenerate.

    <description>"None without this blood within may strike you down, and by this blood you shall not die."
— Prophecy uttered during the Sanguine Rite

Before you stands an emaciated undead man. He looks downward, with sallow red-glowing eyes hidden behind a mass of long, matted black hair. His nose is rotted and gone, his flesh cracked and decayed, and his bent pose a far cry from the imperial majesty he possessed and lost so long ago. He is swathed only in an ancient burial shroud and wrappings worn like a robe. Across his neck, a prominent and wretched scar marks how his head was sewn back upon his shoulders. He drags an ancient obsidian greatsword behind him, holding the weapon by its blade as a thin trickle of blood seeps from his fingers. From his back emerge the broken stumps of clipped wings, now little more than useless limbs of tattered gore. Yet, there is a quiet, primal power thrumming within his form.

When returned to unlife via the Sanguine Rite, Vladimir von Drakken first manifests in this form. He remains in this form until he has fed on enough individuals of sufficient power, upon which he assumes his Reborn form.
    Although he cannot be permanently destroyed in this form, Vladimir von Drakken is greatly weakened in this state and desires nothing more than returning to his full power.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. Vladimir speaks with vile overconfidence, a sinister smirk, and a demeanor of a creature who believes himself a god, he does not tolerate others treating him as any less than a king of kings.
• Bond. Vladimir will stop at nothing to conquer the continent and reclaim his throne in Drakkenheim. He made it, and it is his to rule, any other who attempts to sit upon it is an imposter.
• Ideal. "This realm belongs to the dead, and the dead shall keep it. Any who stand in the way of my reign will join my legions by choice, or by force."
• Flaw. Vladimir believes himself entirely indestructible and is blind to the loopholes within the rites that created him. Nevertheless, he is hesitant to trust anyone. He refuses to let anyone get close and assumes everyone is plotting against him.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Religion gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when taking the Study action to examine Vladimir von Drakken, learning the following based on the result:
(15+) Deadly Foe. You know of the creature's Resistances and Immunities.
(20+) Renowned Swordsman. You are aware of his Bloodmourne and Bite attacks.
(25+) Nearly Undefeatable. You recognize his Reborn or Ascendent Transformation trait.

Combat Tactics
Vladimir von Drakken is presented here in three forms. As the Ascendent Vampire grows in power he transforms into a new form until he returns to his full strength.
    If he is successfully resurrected with the Sanguine Rite, Vladimir von Drakken first begins in his Crypt-Starved form. He remains in this form until he consumes the blood of a living descendant of House von Drakken, which enables him to turn into his Reborn form.
    If reduced to 0 Hit Points in his Reborn form, Vladimir von Drakken unleashes his Ascendant form.
    In his Crypt-Starved form, Vladimir von Drakken is a craven and desperate combatant. He primarily aims to drink as much blood as possible using his Bite to transform into his Reborn form. He makes use of Shadow Step and Terrifying Glare to reposition himself and hold foes at bay.
    Once he regains his Reborn form, Vladimir von Drakken is nearly unstoppable. He wades into melee with Bloodmourne, demonstrating his martial superiority by using his manoeuvres. He uses his Claws and Bite as finishing moves and uses Dominate to bend his foes to his will. When surrounded, he uses Wing Blast to reposition.
    Assuming his Ascendant form, Vladimir von Drakken becomes an engine of bloodlust and destruction, fueled by primal rage and undead power. In this form, he rips foes apart with melee attacks and flays their spirits whenever his Soul Rend becomes available.

Slaying Vladimir von Drakken
Vladimir cannot be fully destroyed unless he is wholly unmade at the place he was first transformed. Wholly destroying Vladimir von Drakken is difficult. Once he is defeated in combat, with the final blow struck by one who shares his blood, his heart must be cut out, and placed upon the altar within the Standing Stones in in the Brachenwald where he was transformed into a vampire.Under a full moon at midnight, a wooden stake made from a branch from Elenthas the Evertree must be driven through the heart by one of his blood descendants. Then, the heart must be left there until sunrise where it is destroyed by first light. Vladimir von Drakken's minions do not stand idly whilst this happens, and launch a massive assault upon the grove with the desperate aim of retrieving his heart before it is destroyed by the sun.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Crystalline Dreg, learning the following based on their result:

(10+) Reflecting Attacks. You learn of the Dreg's Refracted Beam attack.
(15+) Prone to Shattering. You understand the creature's Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage.

Combat Tactics
The Crystalline Dreg is quite literally a glass cannon. It prefers to stay behind other Dregs, blasting its foes with its beam attacks and absorbing any elemental damage to alter its attacks. If an enemy who can deal Bludgeoning damage is present, the Crystalline Dreg will flee from that creature and attempt to kill them from a distance, knowing it is their biggest threat. The Dreg tends to focus on enemies approaching with melee weapons over anyone using elemental damage. If the front line of Dregs that the Crystalline Dreg often uses as shield is gone, or if the Crystalline Dregs are outnumbered and threatened with melee combat, they attempt to flee.

Harvestable Components (Uncommon)

(15+) Burning Eye. You're aware of the Hulk's Eye Laser attack.
(20+) Strong and Tough. You recognize the Hulk's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Cyclopean Hulk is often a brutish protector for other Dregs. It uses its Eye Laser to disintegrate enemies into a fine delerium dust. The Cyclopean Hulk focuses its power on blasting enemies from afar or slamming them into the ground if they get close. It will then Wink out of existence, reappearing every few seconds to deliver a devastating blast from its eye before vanishing again. Cyclopean Hulks usually fight to the end, and rarely flee.

    <description>The remains of a corpse is splayed across a ruined wall. A chaotic mass of jet-black brambles and vines pours from its torso, clinging to the nearby stonework. Branches have burst from its form, and its neck erupts into another mass of plant matter. The skull is severed from the body with its jaw unhinged and hanging in a horrible expression, stuck in place by the writhing vines. Throughout this Dark Growth, flowers bloom in iridescent neon hues and the smell of sweet pollen and decaying flesh fills the air. You hear gentle whispers from a distant voice, distinctly familiar and beckoning.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks to Study a Dark Growth, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Contaminated and Thriving. You are aware of the Dark Growth's Resistances and Immunities.
(10+) Deadly Spores. You recognize the creature's Infection Spores action.
(15+) Kill it with fire! You know the creature's Vulnerability to Fire, and its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
A Dark Growth is a simple-minded plant. It uses Mimicry to lure passing creatures towards it, often mimicking the sounds of children or people in need. It entangles and infests any target near it, infecting it with its spores. The creature is a stationary plant and does not flee.

Harvestable Components (Rare)
Animus: Plant. Fluid: Contaminated Ichor, Sap. Organs: Flowers. Bones: Stems Natural Weapons: Spores, Needles. Hair: Leaves Dust: Plant Dust.

    <description>Emerging from the contaminated waters is a humanoid figure with disturbing piscine mutations. Their body is covered in glittering scales of sea green, midnight purple, and deep blue. Their monstrous face has two large, bulbous eyes and a gaping, fishlike mouth filled with oddly-shaped teeth—a mixture of humanoid, shark, and other aquatic animals. Spindly, fleshy whiskers surround their fish lips. They have webbed feet and hands, and thin fins jut from their arms, legs, and face. They wear little more than ragged clothing and scraps of leather armor, and carry a brace of javelins, a spear, and a fishing net.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when Studying a Deep Dreg Warrior, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Amphibious Mutant. You know the creature is a capable swimmer and is immune to Contamination.
(10+) Foe Catcher. You are aware of the Deep Dreg Warrior's Net attack and Catch of the Day trait.
(15+) Strong and Tough. You learn the creature's strongest and weakest saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Deep Dreg Warriors attack from the water, throwing their spears and diving back under the surface as added protection against ranged retaliation. When they engage in melee, the warriors use their Net to restrain their foes, and make melee attacks (with the bonus damage from Catch of the Day) to knock them Unconscious.
    Deep Dregs Warriors flee whenever they are outnumbered or if they are reduced below half their maximum Hit Points. They swim to safety rather than die fighting, and prefer to fall back and retaliate after gathering reinforcements.

Combat Tactics
The Deep Knight is the forward assault of the Deep Dregs and uses their seashell shields to deflect attacks and their harpoons to pull enemies into close range before biting them with their shark teeth.
    The Deep Knight will defend the other Deep Dregs to the death. If it is the last one standing it will attempt to flee, but as long as there are allies to protect, it will stay and fight.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage of Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Deep Siren. They learn the following information based on their check result.
(5+) Amphibious Mutant. You know the creature is a capable swimmer and is immune to Contamination.
(10+) Illusive Opponent. You are aware of the creature's Misty Step action.
(15+) Nimble and Enchanting. You learn the Deep Siren's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Deep Sirens are the generals and confidants to the Duchess and often serve as the eyes and ears of their mistress. They use their Illusory Appearance to walk among humanoids and observe them, planning and plotting the attacks of the Deep Dregs. Once it has gathered information, a Deep Siren returns to the Duchess, and is often sent with the Deep Dregs to storm beaches, infiltrate sewers, or take over cities on stormy nights.
    The siren doesn't like being in close combat, and always at- tempts to use Misty Step to move to a more beneficial position, then unleash Storm Lash or spellcasting upon their foes.
    They flee if surrounded, if outnumbered, or if they feel the battle is not going in their favor.

    <description>This unearthly dragon is a crystalline horror, its body formed from angular gem-like scales pulsing with octarine light. Its form is raw delerium. Each scale is a gleaming crystal refracting light into eerie hues of purple, yellow, and green, with an unnatural sharpness that feels both fragile and impossibly durable.
    The dragon's wings are translucent and webbed with glowing crystal veins that shimmer, casting kaleidoscopic patterns as it moves. Each beat causes the air to hum, vibrating with a chaotic energy that overwhelms and distorts the senses. Each step the dragon takes leaves delicate motes of crystal growing into jagged formations, tainting the landscape. Its eyes are like multifaceted gems, swirling with chaotic magic pooling within their depths. 
    The beast's crystalline horns and talons are razor-sharp, gleaming like polished jewels, yet crackling with eldritch energy.

Playful and full of wonder, Delerium Dragon Wyrmlings do not stray far from where they hatch, as they still must contend with their multidimensional existence. A wyrmling usually does not yet fully understand their transtemporal senses, and experiences memories of their adulthood and future in dreams and visions.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Delerium Dragon, learning the following based on the result.
(15+) Empowered by Eldritch Magic. You understand the dragon's Resistances and senses.
(20+) Octarine Breath. You recognize the effects of the Delerium Dragon's breath weapon, as well as noting its Spellcasting capabilities.
(25+) Few Weaknesses. You learn its highest and lowest saving throws. 

Combat Tactics
A Delerium Dragon views combat less as a violent encounter and more as a chance to change foes into a new form. It darts about using flight and teleportation, seldom remaining in the same place for more than a turn. Their movement makes it easy for the dragon to find the perfect place to catch many enemies with its breath weapon. Delerium Dragons love to spread contamination and cause arcane anomalies, and delight causing monstrous transformations with their contaminated attacks. 
    Delerium Dragons use their Bite, Contaminated Rend, and Tail attacks to tear opponents apart in between uses of their breath weapon.

Harvestable Components (Uncommon)

Delerium. In addition, characters can collect delerium crystals from its body. A wyrmling has 2d4 fragments.

    <description>This wretched figure has been twisted and warped by eldritch contamination. Beneath their shredded and torn clothing, you can see all manner of sores, lesions, and bulging blood vessels upon their purple-gray flesh, and their limbs and joints bend at unnatural angles. Their facial features are unnaturally warped into a permanent expression of confused agony, and an octarine glow fills their sunken eyes. Small aberrant mutations appear across their bodies: crystalline bony protrusions and small tendrils bursting forth through their skin, a yellow eyeball blinking open upon their neck, and a disturbingly elongated tongue. As they catch sight of you, they moan painfully and lunge forward.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Delerium Dreg, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Humans Transformed. You know these Aberrations are immune to further delerium Contamination but otherwise have no special Resistances.
(10+) Contaminating Claws. You recognize the dangers of the creature's Claw attack.
(15+) Shambling Corruption. You understand the creature's
highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Delerium Dregs are desperate and confused combatants, incapable of any complex tactics beyond lunging towards their foes to attack by the most direct means. If they see a creature who is not contaminated, they will attack on sight. However, they will band together to form small herds, shuffling through ruins, or wandering the streets together. A wounded Delerium Dreg typically responds with fury and rage, attacking whatever damaged it last without regard to its personal wellbeing. In very rare cases, a wounded Dreg may attempt to flee, especially from a much more formidable combatant.

Harvestable Components (Common)
Animus: Aberration. Fluid: Monster Blood, Contaminated Ichor. Organs: Eyes, Heart, Brain, Guts, Flesh. Bones:
Skull, Spine, Ribs. Natural Weapons: Claws. Hair: Hair. Hide: Skin. Dust: Aberrant Dust.

    <description>Scuttling atop dozens of spindly legs, this grotesque creature resembles a mutated centipede grown to horrific proportions. A segmented body nearly thirty feet long undulates atop unnaturally bending limbs resembling emaciated human fingers. Elongated yellow fingernails crackle and scrape the ground menacingly as it moves. Dominating its fat, round head is a single, massive human-like eye that swivels frenetically with a disturbing, unyielding intensity. Its antenna sprouts above like an eyebrow, while tightly closed mandibles resemble bags under the eye. Its foremost finger-legs end in pincer-like talons thrumming with electricity.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Digipede, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Charged Form. You recognize the creature's Resistance to Lightning damage and that it has Tremorsense thanks to its large antenna.
(15+) Sharp and Shocking. You are aware of the Digipede's Talons and Eye Beam actions.
(20+) Insectile Predator. You learn the creature's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Despite its size, a Digipede will try to hide along rooftops, dark corners, narrow alleys, and any crevice which can accommodate it. It launches its Eye Beam from hiding to hinder its prey's escape, then rips into them with its Talons and Bite. The electric shocks from its attacks disrupt the ability of its prey to effectively fight back.

Harvestable Components (Rare)
Animus: Monstrosity. Fluid: Monster Blood, Contaminated Ichor, Elemental Fluid. Organs: Eyes, Heart, Guts. Natural Weapons: Claws. Hide: Carapace.

    <description>Dr. Everett Freed regards you with a stern frown. He is longfaced, bald-headed, and wears thick, circular glasses that magnify his focused gaze. Beneath his bleached-white surgical apron, he is dressed in a tailored dark jacket. The coat is deceptively normal: thick and heavy, it conceals numerous pockets stuffed with vials and unusual instruments. His hands, sheathed in slightly stained rubber gloves, tightly grip a black leather doctor's bag at his side. A faint scent of formaldehyde and burnt metal clings to him.

Reanimator Minions. It's possible Dr. Freed was the first to create many creatures. He is most well known as the first to create Reautomata. In the process of making his magnum opus, Freed built creatures such as the Body Snatcher, Cerebrograft, the Ripper, and the Stitcher. Freed's experiments did not stop there, and in many ways his practice ascended the body alone thanks to his collaborations with the Alienist Dr. Sina Rienks, eventually transforming himself into a Think Tank.

Mind Over Body. One of Freed's infamous gambits was to remove his brain from his own body, placing it into a body double. Eventually, Freed became a Think Tank, able to remotely control brainless bodies from his hidden sanctum.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I am always calm and composed, especially when explaining the 'necessary' cruelty of my experiments.
• Ideal. Progress demands sacrifice; the advancement of knowledge justifies all actions, no matter how gruesome.
• Bond. I still possess the first successful reanimation I ever created: the preserved head of a beloved family member. It's both my proudest achievement and my darkest secret.
• Flaw. I am obsessed with the perfection and infallibility of my creations, often dismissing any evidence of their defects, uncontrollable behavior, and horrific appearances. I never accept any failure as my fault

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine or Survival gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study the Reanimator, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Protected by the Reanimated. You know of his Resistances, Immunities, and Bodyguard Reaction.
(15+) Deadly Toxins. You are aware of his Touch of Death.
(20+) Electrical Reinvigoration. You learn of his Reanimate action.

Combat Tactics
Prior to combat, Freed casts False Life and Death Ward on himself, and perhaps any allies joining him in battle. He does not engage in combat without creations by his side. If Freed is caught alone, he doesn't fight; he flees. However, when supported by his loyal creations, he can be overconfident and brash, secure that his bodyguards will keep him safe from harm. Freed always remains within 10 feet of one or more creations so he can use his Bodyguard Reaction reliably.
    On his turn, Freed uses Electric Jolt and Necrotic Blast to hammer his foes, while directing a favored creation with Creator's Command. Should one of his minions be brought down, he uses Reanimate and immediately sends it back into the action with Creator's Command.
    Freed uses Touch of Death against a particularly loathsome foe, one who harries him with dangerous abilities, or who he especially wishes to slay. All the while, he threatens his enemies by telling them his plans for their body parts once he's killed them

A jagged ridge of delerium runs along its back, ending in a fell crown atop its head as pallid skin frames its octarine glowing eyes. A thick, purple tentacle-like tongue undulates out of its tooth-filled maw. Strong and sturdy legs support its scarred body, attesting to countless battles in the ruins.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Animal Handling gain Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks to study a Drakkenheim Sewer Gator, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Fearless Aquatic Predator! You learn the Drakkenheim Sewer Gator's condition Immunities and Swim speed.
(10+) Watch out for its bite! You are aware of the creature's Crushing Bite and Death Roll actions.
(15+) Get it out of the water! You know of the creature's Contaminated Regeneration trait.

Combat Tactics
The Drakkenheim Sewer Gator is primarily aquatic, haunting the sewer system or the Drann River. These monstrosities lunge from the waters to grab prey, dragging it beneath the surface. Once a target is in its jaws, the gator Death Rolls until its victim stops moving. It is a cunning hunter, knowing how to disappear below murky waters, but it can be provoked to chase its prey. Out of the water it is vulnerable and flees if reduced below half its Hit Points.

    <description>This ancient druid is adorned in skulls and bones hanging off its thick gray cloak. They carry a staff of bone drenched in animal blood, with dried blood painted on their face and clothes. Their features are skeletal in nature, their skin stretched tightly over them. They appear ancient, their eyes sunken and black, their teeth yellowed with age and neglect. The druid whispers in forgotten tongues as they perform blood sacrifices and draw on primal magics.

Study The Foe
Characters proficient in Religion or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when taking the Study action to examine a Druid of the Sanguine Rite, learning the following based on the result.
(10+) Unrelenting Unlife. You recognize the creature's Regeneration trait.
(15+) Bloody Renewal. You learn of the creature's Bloodthorn Whip attack and Plasma Absorption trait
(20+) Unnaturally Aware. You know their highest and lowest ability scores

Combat Tactics
The druid of the blood rites uses dark magic to twist the lifeforce of other creatures. The druid uses its bloodthorn whip to inflict a series of open wounds upon its foes, and then feeds on their life- force by pulling it through their wounds using plasma absorption.
    When not directly engaged in combat, the druids attempt to charm a group of foes and convince them to partake in their blood rituals, using their life force as sacrifice to empower one of their own.
    If the druids are directly confronted with greater numbers, or their health is below half, they attempt to flee.

A mass of thin strands dangle down from of the creature, pulsating with bioluminescent light. The tendrils move and glide about, gently groping and grabbing at objects as it passes by. The whole creature glows, illuminating the darkened city streets around it. A distant chorus of ethereal hums and tones fill the air.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study an Effulgent Cnidarian, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Aberrant Resistance. You recognize the monster's Immunities and Resistances.
(10+) Hypnotic Color Change. You learn of the monster's Hallucinogenic Bioluminescence trait.
(15+) Weak but Aware. You are aware of the monster's Strength and Dexterity ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Effulgent Cnidarians are not predatorial — they only want to bask in the glow of delerium crystals, feeding slowly on the arcane energies they emit. They are, however, protective of their food sources. If creatures venture into an area of heavy delerium crystallization, they are sure to find a few Cnidarians bobbing about. The Cnidarian prefers to use its Hallucinogenic Bioluminescence to dissuade threats from engaging it, instead hoping to cause its enemies to kill one another. The Cnidarians feed on creatures under its hypnosis, absorbing their essence through its tendrils. If attacked, it uses its Reflexive Flash and attempts to move away from its threats, often floating straight up as quickly as it can and out of the reach of danger. Cnidarians do not stay around to fight. If all targets have avoided its charm, and are actively attacking it, it abandons its  food source to seek other safer areas.

    <description>Eldrick Runeweaver is a towering and broad-shouldered black man in his mid-sixties. His amber eyes glow softly behind his circular glasses, and a square-cut graying black beard. Eldrick wears nine rings of silver, gold, and electrum: one on each finger except his left thumb. He wears flowing purple garb with golden embroidery and carries an obsidian staff tipped with a delerium crystal.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I carefully calculate my every action, and I speak using a few well-chosen words. I'm a teacher at heart, so I often phrase my responses in the form of a pointed question.
• Ideal. I will seek out more information whenever I encounter an unknown situation or problem. Through reason and logic, the facts always bear out the truth of the matter.
• Bond. I hold a position of responsibility and authority within the Amethyst Academy, and it is my duty to protect the Academy's interests, carry out its agenda, and keep its many secrets.
• Flaw. I care deeply for my students but tend to overlook their faults and failures. I've had several wayward apprentices over the years, and I've often had to cover up their mistakes.

Eldrick Runeweaver has a Cat familiar, travels with an Iron Golem bodyguard, and a Homunculus servant. He most often communicates via Sending, Telepathic Bond, and Project Image spells, or by sending his simulacrum instead. Eldrick has a clone kept in a distant stronghold with extra equipment should the unthinkable occur.

    <description>A swirling vortex of dark clouds, debris, and icy shards moves in like an eldritch storm. Crackling octarine lightning fills the air, the ground rumbles and shakes with the might of the unnatural weather phenomenon, but this is no ordinary storm. Within the dark clouds appears a snarling face, its eyes and mouth like pools of octarine light. The creature is the weather itself, warped and infused by the Haze of Drakkenheim into an arcane and twisted form of life, filled with the uncaring and unbridled anger of a storm.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study an Eldritch Cataclysm, learning the following based on their result:
(15+) Amalgamation of Energies. You learn the creature's Immunities, as well as its Air Form trait.
(20+) An Octarine Storm. You recognize its Chain Lightning, Meteor Strike, Quake, and Icy Bolt actions.
(25+) Exceedingly Resilient. You are aware of its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Eldritch Cataclysms rule the skies, and never willingly descend to the ground. Instead, it rains down lightning, meteors, and icy blasts from above. The temperamental nature of these elementals means they delight in attacking with a variety of elements, and seldom use the same action two rounds in a row. They enjoy using their Meteor Strike on targets they've Frozen with Icy Bolt, and delight in using their Cyclonic Storm to blow away weapons and equipment dropped by targets of their Chain Lightning.
    These enraged creatures revel in destruction but have little conception that anything could actually pose a threat to them. When confronted with a foe able to withstand their onslaught, they treat it as a personal affront, and furiously focus their subsequent attacks upon them occasionally to the exclusion of all else. Despite this single-minded strategy, an Eldritch Cataclysm can recognize when a creature is resistant or immune to its elemental attacks and tries to use only the most effective powers against its chosen target.

Harvestable Components (Very Rare)

    <description>Amidst a web of fractured realities and glimpsed timelines sits an arachnid creature with twisted features. Its elongated form writhes and shivers as it clambers across its broken glass mosaic of possibilities. Its fanged maw gnashes and chomps. Within its movements one can make out faint resounding reverberations of possible movements and reactions that did not occur, as if with every step the creature takes, an infinite ghost of possible movements it may have taken glimmer and fade. 

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine an Eldritch Crawler, learning the following based on the result.
(5+) Uncontainable. You know the creature's Resistances and Immunities. 
(10+) Escape Reality. You are aware of the creature's Void Walker Bonus Action. 
(15+) Dull and Diffident. You recognize the creature's highest and lowest ability scores. 

Combat Tactics
The Eldritch Crawlers weave together fractured timelines, and slip in and out of the Space Between Worlds with ease. They create their own Thin Places and travel through them back and forth as needed. When under attack, Eldritch Crawlers bend and alter the realities they exist in to shift to one where they are more likely to survive. They teleport around the battlefield and vanish into the Space Between Worlds as they need to, using Void Walker and their Fractured Reality Reaction, only to re-emerge and attack their prey with Contaminated Venom.

Combat Tactics
An Eldritch Dreg curses its chosen target with Hazewarp Hex, and then hammers it with its Psychic Blast. It uses Levitate to keep itself out of melee by hovering above the battlefield and it will unleash its Synaptic Shock if its enemies are close to one another. If brought to less than half its Hit Points, it attempts to flee.

Queen's Men Combat Tactics
Amongst the Queen's Men, different groups may be organized as infiltrators, thieves, saboteurs, and assassins, who work unseen until the moment they strike. In contrast, highway robbers and enforcers operate openly, trying to shakedown and intimidate their marks to give up any valuables without a fight. Regardless, members of the Queen's Men are seldom willing to stick around when a fight starts going against them, valuing their own lives first and foremost.

Eldritch Trolls stalk the streets of the Inner City of Drakkenheim attempting to contaminate any creature they come across. They use Corrupting Blast to contaminate their foes, mutating to whatever best suits them in the battle, and then use their Claws and Bite.
    If an Eldritch Troll takes Psychic damage, it immediately flees and attempts to find a safe place to recuperate.

Within the dancing flames is a scornful expression of rage. It crackles and blazes, the heat from its body distorting the air around it. The pungent smell of burning ozone and sulfur saturates the area, and flecks of cinder and ash whirl about, shedding from the creature as it glides menacingly toward you.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study an Entropic Flame, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Supernaturally Resilient. You are aware of the creature's Immunities.
(15+) Inextinguishable Fires. You learn of the elemental's Dancing Flame action and Flickerjump Bonus Action, as well as its Enduring Flame trait.
(20+) Swift and Senseless. You know the creature's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
An Entropic Flame is a haughty combatant driven by a burning desire to set the world on fire. It teleports from place to place using its Flickerjump, setting alight creatures and objects using its Dancing Flames. If possible, it tries to remain close to Burning targets to keep them on fire within its Enduring Flame aura. Within the smoking ruins of Drakkenheim, Entropic Flames love to set buildings, furniture, and other objects on fire. They quickly turn the battlefield into a roiling inferno, one which cannot be extinguished easily thanks to their presence.

Appearing in strange hues of pale pinks, purples, and whites, its large single eye in the middle of its fleshy mass glows with octarine hues, weakening body and mind. The soft sound of thrumming and suckling follows it as it assaults minds with insane chattering in unknown languages.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine an Entropic Watcher, learning the following based on the result.
(10+) Guarded Existence. You learn the creature's Resistances and Immunities. 
(15+) Imperiling Stare. You recognize the creature's Withering Gaze feature.
(20+) Physically Resilient. You know the creature's highest and lowest ability scores. 

Combat Tactics
The Entropic Watcher is a keen hunter who, by its very gaze, can cause a creature to grow weak and leave it open for annihilation. The Entropic Watcher focuses its gaze upon its prey and unleashes its eye beams towards it, knowing that if it can hold its gaze, the creature will succumb to the watcher's blasts much easier. It will use its Force Barrier and Shadow Crash to force its victims into an optimal position for it to strike, and grab them with its tendrils, holding them readily in its Withering Gaze.
    If the Entropic Watcher is reduced to less than 50 Hit Points, it attempts to flee.

    <description>The massive construct looms menacingly within the center of Slaughterstone Square. Pacing back and forth, it drags its guillotine blade behind it, with the grinding of steel on stone echoing off the old buildings. Its form is a mass of steel plates and gears resembling a huge suit of armor. From within its frame, the glow of octarine light illuminates it with an eerie glow of corruption. The poor souls of its victims cling to it, reaching out in terror as if clawing to escape their last moments when the Executioner took their heads.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or artisan's tools gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine the Executioner, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Unstoppable Machine. You know of the Executioner's Immutable Form, Dimensional Anchor, and Rejuvenation traits, as well as its damage Immunities.
(10+) Strange Abilities. You recognize its Destroyer, Summon Grasping Shadow, and Guillotine Blade actions.
(15+) Powerfully Tough. You are aware of the Executioner's strongest and weakest saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Executioner is not a foe to be defeated, but rather an obstacle to be avoided or a danger to escape. It is a reminder of the callous and uncontrollable dangers present in Drakkenheim. The Executioner's combat tactics vary based on whether it detects low-level characters trespassing in Slaughterstone Square or high-level characters trying to defeat the machine itself. The Executioner pursues its targets within Slaughterstone Square, but never leaves the plaza.
    When the Executioner detects creatures trespassing on Slaughterstone Square, it responds first by using Summon Grasping Shadows, followed up by Death Grip to try to prevent their escape. Meanwhile, it uses Lumber Forward to gain ground. You should embrace clever solutions that characters invent to escape or bypass the Executioner. As long as your players aren't trying to destroy it, the Executioner will only use Guillotine Blade against a Restrained target within its melee range, and does not make ranged attacks nor activate its Necrotic Vents aura.
    However, should your players engage the Executioner directly in combat, do not pull any punches. They have made an incredibly foolish mistake by confronting a well-telegraphed deathtrap and should be served their just desserts. It activates its Necrotic Vents, and then relentlessly attacks with its Guillotine Blade. The Executioner throws the massive weapon to hit targets trying to avoid it in melee, or those that try to harm it with ranged weapons or spells. If it encounters any impediment in its way (such as a Wall of Force), it crushes it with Destroyer.

Exorcists Minions. Exorcists deal with all manner of entities. They can call forth Specters, Ghosts, Demons, Wraiths, and other extraplanar entities. The most horrifying creation of the Exorcist is the Soulbound Host, which occurs when an Exorcist allows themself to be a vessel for demonic, extraplanar, or fairy entities, attempting to harness the power of such beings. Most are driven mad during the process.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I speak to the dead often, sometimes when I am not even sure if they are there.
• Bond. The understanding of life and death grants us power over the planes that few have dared to grasp.
• Ideal. It is in control of demons and ghosts that we will transcend to our true potential.
• Flaw. I am sure I have the strength within me to host a demon or spirit without succumbing to its will.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine or Religion gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study an Exorcist, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Demons and Undead. You recognize the Exorcist's Immunities as well as their Expel Evil action.
(10+) Master of Possession. You are aware of the Exorcist's Grasping Ghost action.
(15+) Weak of Character and Body. You learn the Exorcist's Strength and Charisma ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Exorcist relies on its divine weapons and direct combat skills. They often reside in locations that have natural hazards where they can use their Grasping Ghosts to force enemies into danger. Hazards could include burning braziers, spiked pits, or a pool of blessed acid. If any foe has a summoned creature, the Exorcist dispatches it using Expel Evil, and destroys any undead foes with Last Rites.
    If the Exorcist is in a losing situation, they attempt to use Spiritual Healing on themself before fleeing.

    <description>The grim-faced doctor's jaw tightens as they lower their brow and sigh. Suddenly, their face contorts into a wicked, impossible grimace, a smile stretched too wide for the muscles on their face. Fiendish light glimmers in their eyes as hornlike bulges rip through the flesh of their forehead. Profane runes suddenly blaze upon their flesh, releasing the smell of burning meat and sulfur. The body rises into the air, the muscle spasms barely containing the evil spirit bound within this mortal host. A spiral of flame encircles the apothecary's body as they unleash a horrific scream, speaking in a voice which is not their own. "Now, you will die, mortal."

Desperate Gambit. A Soulbound Host (Fiendish, Faerie or Aberrant) is usually created under truly desperate circumstances, such as when a heroic apothecary faces a dangerous otherworldly being such as a demon, fey, spirit, or inscrutable entity from the Space Between Worlds. Not only are these planar invaders pernicious foes, many are effectively immortal—often these creatures simply reform when killed outside their native planes. Thus, an apothecary who lacks the ability to defeat the demon on their own, or who wishes to defeat a powerful outsider in a more permanent fashion, may instead decide upon a heroic act of self-sacrifice by turning themselves into a Soulbound Host.

Preparing the Trap. Using an array of implanted metals, ingested tinctures, mental preparations, and occult incantations, a skilled apothecary may willingly prepare their body for possession. During the process, the apothecary can weave a unique spiritual trap. It then falls to the apothecary to convince the otherworldly creature to possess them, an act that many outsiders are eager to do. Thus, the canny apothecary preys on the ego of the monster itself.

Mortal Curse. When the outsider inhabits the body, the apothecary's soul departs, leaving the extraplanar creature to take their place spiritually. If this mortal form is killed or destroyed, the bound creature does not simply return to their plane of origin. Instead, the spirit departs to the afterworlds
like any other mortal soul, losing their accumulated otherworldly power forever. Thus, the Soulbound Host becomes both a prison and a death sentence for the other wielding being tricked into the apothecary's body.

Rogue Hosts. Unfortunately, this act of self-sacrifice is not without its imperfections. The apothecary's body is filled with otherworldly essence, and while the creature's power is greatly diminished, they often remain extremely dangerous—allies of the departed apothecary may still find it challenging to slay the Soulbound Host. Many escape, wandering the world with stolen lives and even assuming the identity of their host while they search for the means to escape their now mortal form. All bound outsiders are painfully aware of their new mortality, frustrated that returning to their planes of origin is not a simple matter of destroying their flesh-cage or switching their essence into a different host, one which lacks the binding wards placed by the apothecary.

Price of Freedom. Trapped outsiders can win their freedom by calling back the soul of the apothecary who trapped them, and resurrecting them into their body. This is a thing many outsiders are loathe to do out of fiendish ego, since it puts the original soul in a bargaining position. In this way, the apothecary can force the spirit to accept a bargain which requires them to remain in their own worlds for at least the duration of the apothecary's lifetime.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Religion, Medicine, or Survival gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Soulbound Host, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Possessed Body. You know the Soulbound Host's type and damage Resistances.
(15+) Extraplanar Magic. Depending on the type of spirit, you learn either the Hellfire Chain, Illusory Assault, or Psychic Barrage actions, as well as the Spellcasting trait of the host.
(20+) Cursed Fate. You recognize its desperation caused by its spirit-bound mortality and its Reactions.

Combat Tactics
A Soulbound Host is a careful combatant. Though powerful, the last thing they want is to be killed in their mortal form. If they are seriously injured, they often attempt to bargain, offering power and knowledge to assailants who spare them.

    <description>This tall, gangly creature hovers ominously, levitating inches above the ground. Its arms hang loosely at its sides and thin legs dangle below its body. Shifting motes of otherworldly energy dance between its long, gnarled fingers. Its purple-gray skin stretches tightly over its emaciated frame. Instead of a head, a mass of thick, writhing tentacles sprouts from its neck, reaching out into the air. The atmosphere around it vibrates with chittering whispers, slurping and the hoarse mumbles of maddening truths and incomprehensible realities.

A Far Dweller often disregards creatures it deems lesser than itself until it is outwardly threatened, often outright ignoring nearby mortals like one might ignore a passing insect or rodent. However, when provoked they are intelligent, efficient, and ruthless. Thanks to its great intellect, a Far Dweller rapidly assesses the capabilities of its attackers and responds to methodically dismantle them accordingly.
    Far Dwellers begin combat by casting Maze, Hypnotic Pattern, or Slow to incapacitate as many foes as possible. On subsequent turns, it uses Contaminate and Mind Scramble to launch a contaminated psychic assault, preferring to target spellcasters and physically weak targets, while choosing physically strong but easily manipulated targets for Pluck the Puppet Strings.
    When attacked, a Far Dweller disappears temporarily using Vanish to the Space Between Worlds. Note that this ability functions normally on the Space Between Worlds itself, as the Far Dweller momentarily travels to a different spatial dimension on that plane.
    A Far Dweller is always willing to abandon a fight and its projects if it is sufficiently threatened, and will flee to the Space Between Worlds using Plane Shift if it is Bloodied.

The creature moves without making a sound and seems engulfed in blinding light from an unknown source.

Study The Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Far Dweller Abductor, learning the following based on the result.
(10+) Psychic Fortress. You learn the creature's Resistances and Immunities. 
(15+) Confounding Existence. You are aware of the creature's Unfathomable Presence trait. 
(20+) Malign Brilliance. They learn the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.  

Combat Tactics
The Far Dweller Abductors are not fighters, and simply wish to gather specimens and study them. When Abductors appear, they usually do so when a creature is resting or asleep. They rely on their Unfathomable Presence to confuse and dismantle their target. They use Mind Warp or Devour Thoughts to weaken the mind of their target before attempting to Abduct them.
    The Far Dweller Abductors do not wish to be observed or remembered, and do not want even their dead left behind to be discovered and known to the creatures they are researching. A Far Dweller Abductor will teleport away and use Plane Shift if it has lost the upper hand, is outnumbered, or feels in any way threatened. If a Far Dweller Abductor dies, any Far Dwellers still engaged in battle attempt to take their bodies and vanish as quickly as possible, attempting to leave no trace of their presence.

    <description>The grim-faced doctor's jaw tightens as they lower their brow and sigh. Suddenly, their face contorts into a wicked, impossible grimace, a smile stretched too wide for the muscles on their face. Fiendish light glimmers in their eyes as hornlike bulges rip through the flesh of their forehead. Profane runes suddenly blaze upon their flesh, releasing the smell of burning meat and sulfur. The body rises into the air, the muscle spasms barely containing the evil spirit bound within this mortal host. A spiral of flame encircles the apothecary's body as they unleash a horrific scream, speaking in a voice which is not their own. "Now, you will die, mortal."

Desperate Gambit. A Soulbound Host (Fiendish, Faerie or Aberrant) is usually created under truly desperate circumstances, such as when a heroic apothecary faces a dangerous otherworldly being such as a demon, fey, spirit, or inscrutable entity from the Space Between Worlds. Not only are these planar invaders pernicious foes, many are effectively immortal—often these creatures simply reform when killed outside their native planes. Thus, an apothecary who lacks the ability to defeat the demon on their own, or who wishes to defeat a powerful outsider in a more permanent fashion, may instead decide upon a heroic act of self-sacrifice by turning themselves into a Soulbound Host.

Preparing the Trap. Using an array of implanted metals, ingested tinctures, mental preparations, and occult incantations, a skilled apothecary may willingly prepare their body for possession. During the process, the apothecary can weave a unique spiritual trap. It then falls to the apothecary to convince the otherworldly creature to possess them, an act that many outsiders are eager to do. Thus, the canny apothecary preys on the ego of the monster itself.

Mortal Curse. When the outsider inhabits the body, the apothecary's soul departs, leaving the extraplanar creature to take their place spiritually. If this mortal form is killed or destroyed, the bound creature does not simply return to their plane of origin. Instead, the spirit departs to the afterworlds
like any other mortal soul, losing their accumulated otherworldly power forever. Thus, the Soulbound Host becomes both a prison and a death sentence for the other wielding being tricked into the apothecary's body.

Rogue Hosts. Unfortunately, this act of self-sacrifice is not without its imperfections. The apothecary's body is filled with otherworldly essence, and while the creature's power is greatly diminished, they often remain extremely dangerous—allies of the departed apothecary may still find it challenging to slay the Soulbound Host. Many escape, wandering the world with stolen lives and even assuming the identity of their host while they search for the means to escape their now mortal form. All bound outsiders are painfully aware of their new mortality, frustrated that returning to their planes of origin is not a simple matter of destroying their flesh-cage or switching their essence into a different host, one which lacks the binding wards placed by the apothecary.

Price of Freedom. Trapped outsiders can win their freedom by calling back the soul of the apothecary who trapped them, and resurrecting them into their body. This is a thing many outsiders are loathe to do out of fiendish ego, since it puts the original soul in a bargaining position. In this way, the apothecary can force the spirit to accept a bargain which requires them to remain in their own worlds for at least the duration of the apothecary's lifetime.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Religion, Medicine, or Survival gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Soulbound Host, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Possessed Body. You know the Soulbound Host's type and damage Resistances.
(15+) Extraplanar Magic. Depending on the type of spirit, you learn either the Hellfire Chain, Illusory Assault, or Psychic Barrage actions, as well as the Spellcasting trait of the host.
(20+) Cursed Fate. You recognize its desperation caused by its spirit-bound mortality and its Reactions.

Combat Tactics
A Soulbound Host is a careful combatant. Though powerful, the last thing they want is to be killed in their mortal form. If they are seriously injured, they often attempt to bargain, offering power and knowledge to assailants who spare them.

    <description>Dressed in white and gold robes adorned with the holy symbols of the Sacred Flame, the Flamekeeper recites prayers and holds a burning candle. Warding off evil and healing its allies, it stands as a protective beacon to the Knights of the Silver Order.

Combat Tactics
What the Silver Order lacks in subtlety they make up for with sheer force. They are a military organization, and their soldiers are well trained and work together as a team. When they tackle problems, they do so in a uniform fashion, knowing when to
rely on one another, complete tasks and make pushes in unison. The Silver Order has simple call signs, hand signals, commands, and strategies that they can rely on in the field.
    Silver Order knights and paladins should work as a cohesive unit who know their strengths and how to protect their weaknesses.
    Any Silver Order regiment is accompanied by at least one paladin or Flamekeeper, and usually at least one of each. Larger organized military missions will see griffon riders as well as entire units of paladins and several Flamekeepers or Pyre Priests. This means that no Silver Order unit is without moderate healing, protective buffs, and often forms of divination and holy battle magic. When push comes to shove, the order's divine spellcasters tend to have a few Fireballs and Flamestrikes amongst their options.

    <description>Fluttering in midair is a cavalcade of color, of rushing energy and indecipherable movement, a tessellating fractal impossible to follow with your eyes. With a rush, it brushes past you, tossing you as a leaf on the wind. As you crash to the ground, your confused mind grapples with the creature's unfathomable form. A perpetually unfolding butterfly of vibrant color is the best your mind can interpret from the nonsensical imagery you see.

Lair effect
Fractal Lepidoptera transform reality around them, manifesting the following effect:
Quantum Entanglement. 
Creatures taking a long rest within 1 mile of the lepidoptera must succeed on a DC17 Charisma saving throw or gain a pattern effect. Creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each Long Rest once they are outside the range of Quantum Entanglement. Casting Lesser Restoration or similar spells of higher level on an affected creature can remove the pattern effect. 

Fractal Lepidoptera Patterns
1d6 Effect
1 Something unseen hampers you. You gain the Staggered condition.
2 On each of your turns, you can only walk in straight lines in the direction of either north, south, east, or west.
3 Your hands start to flutter uncontrollably. You gain the Clumsy condition.
4 You can only speak in haikus, rhyming couplets, or iambic pentameter.
5 You float an inch above the ground. Your walking speed is  unchanged and Difficult Terrain does not affect you.
6 You gain the ability to see polarized light and the ultraviolet spectrum. You see invisible objects and creatures, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane.

Getting lost in the Border Ethereal Plane
When encountering a Fractal Lepidoptera, characters can get stranded in the Border Ethereal Plane. This has the potential to derail a campaign. Here are a few suggestions on how to run this scenario instead:
• When the lepidoptera dies, the fabric of reality temporarily weakens and everyone can safely return to the Prime Material Plane.
• Immediately after the lepidoptera dies, the party needs to succeed in a skill challenge to traverse the veil between the planes. Each character can contribute to the skill challenge by suggesting actions that they take to help find the veil, withstand the pull of the Ethereal Plane, and open a gate. The group succeeds if they make 4 successful DC 15 skill checks before 3 failures. 
•The characters must harvest the animus of the lepidoptera and craft a fractal key.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature gain Advantage on  Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a lepidoptera, learning the following based on the result.
(5+) Mothlike Features. You recognize its Phototaxis trait.
(10+) Chaotic Patterns. You learn the lepidoptera's Quantum Entanglement and Tessellation features. 
(15+) Multidimensional. You know of the creature's Multidimensional Presence and Incomprehensible Vision features. 
(20+) Creature of Energy. You are aware of its Vulnerabilities and Energy Form traits. 

Combat Tactics
The lepidoptera flies through creatures while making Fractal Wing attacks, scattering foes with its Energy Form trait. If at least one enemy is Staggered, it targets them with Tessellation. The lepidoptera uses Criss Cross to protect itself from attacks on the border Ethereal Plane.

(15+) Dangerous Hunter. You recognize the Frenzied Dreg's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics

The beast has various restraints around its arms, legs, and neck, all with dangling chains. Other Garmyrs attempt to goad the beast forward. This creature carries two large battleaxes, built from rusted scrap metal and gnarled wood. Its octarine eyes peer angrily from its canine head.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Garmyr Berserker, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Permanent Rage. You know it cannot be Charmed, Frightened, or reasoned with.
(15+) Indiscriminate Attacks. You are aware of its Reckless trait and Retaliate Reaction.
(15+) Strong and Brave. You are aware of their strongest and weakest saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Once unleashed, the Garymyr Berserker uses Aggressive to close with its chosen target, using Howl indiscriminately then swinging away with its axes. Once engaged, the berserker is a mindless killer, and will attack the closest target to itself—whether an enemy or ally. Due to its madness, a berserker never flees.

    <description>Lurking behind the pack is a Garmyr wearing a tattered cloak and hood, leaving only its snarling snout exposed and its red eyes glowing from the dark shroud. Its aloof patience belies its predatory fury. It carries a wicked longbow strung with sinew, and its quiver bristles with thick, barbed arrows.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Garmyr Bloodhound, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Proficient Archer. You know these creatures can see in the dark and that they are immune to Contamination, but otherwise have no other special resistances.
(10+) Isolate Targets. You learn of the bloodhound's Hunter's Quarry Bonus Action.
(15+) Strong and Brave. You recognize the bloodhound's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Garmyr Bloodhound prefers to stick to rooftops and vantage points; moving from place to place, choosing a target, and hitting it with its barbed shot. The bloodhound chooses a quarry and focuses its attention on that target. Often, they are accompanied by other Garmyr who handle the ground assault, while the bloodhound focuses on slowing targets and using its allies to gain Advantage. If its target flees, the Bloodhound marks it as its quarry and leads the hunt after it. 
    If the Garmyr Bloodhound sees its allies losing, it flees before its enemies can reach its vantage point.

(10+) Arcane Caster. You learn of the creature's Spellcasting ability and its spell DC and attack modifier.
(15+) Strong and Brave. You are aware of their strongest and weakest saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The thaumaturge wades into battle surrounded by its allies. It attempts to position itself in a central location so its Aura of the Blood Moon trait affects as many targets as possible. It will use its Blood Call to target creatures from range; only when it has more than one ally on a target does the Thaumaturge consider running in and attacking in melee.
    The thaumaturge will attempt to escape any situation where it is cornered or forced into melee, and if its soldiers numbers are dwindling, it will flee to recuperate.

Walking on all fours, they are closer to their canine origins than that of their fellow Garmyr. Beady, red eyes peer out from sunken sockets, while a mouth of oversized, jagged teeth gnash and snarl.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Garmyr war dog. They learn the following information based on their check result.
(5+) Mutated Canine-Like Creatures. You know these creatures can see in the dark and that they are immune to Contamination, but otherwise have no other special resistances.
(10+) Fight in Packs. You recognize the Garmyr's Pack Tactics trait and Feast Bonus Action.
(15+) Strong and Brave. You are aware of their strongest and weakest saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Using Pack Tactics, the war dogs attack in numbers, ganging up on a single target, knocking it prone, and ravaging it. 
    The war dogs are brutal fighters, and feel no fear, but if their numbers dwindle, they retreat to regroup. They prefer to attack as a pack, and with intention; if the battle becomes too chaotic and more than half their numbers are gone, they flee into the streets.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Garmyr warrior, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Mutated Canine-Like Creatures. You know these creatures can see in the dark and that they are immune to Contamination, but otherwise have no other special resistances.
(10+) Fight in Packs. You recognize the Garmyr's Pack Tactics trait and Feast Bonus Action.
(15+) Strong and Brave. You are aware of their strongest and weakest saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Garmyr warriors fight as a pack, following their leader on the hunt. They choose the juiciest, most delicious-looking target as their prey, favoring unarmored or feeble-looking creatures. Garmyr group up and focus their attacks until they bring down their target, unless a more dangerous threat prompts them to respond.
    Garmyr crave blood and close-quarters battle, closing the distance to attack with their bites even when it may be more advantageous for them to keep their distance using their spears. Garmyr don't stop attacking a foe once they've downed them—they start feasting instead. Garmyr make Bite attacks against downed foes in the midst of battle, making Unconscious and dying characters especially vulnerable to the Garmyr's appetites.
    Garymr are mostly heedless in battle unless their numbers are significantly cut down. Although they prefer to start battles when they outnumber their enemies, they flee as the fight turns against them. However, Garmyr might also attempt to flee once they've secured a meal—a group of Garmyr who manage to down one character in a group might decide to scoop up the victim and enjoy their meal elsewhere rather than continuing to fight.

    <description>The emaciated figure has ash-white skin and is completely hairless. The monster's eyes are two pools of abyssal blackness. Its fingers end in long points, and its teeth are jagged. It lurches away from a fresh corpse it was feasting upon, blood and gore dripping from its maw as it sniffs the air. Smelling something alive, it knows another meal is close by. Its gaze turns in your direction.

This ghoul wears ancient, blackened armor and carries a rusted shield emblazoned with the symbol of House von Drakken. It wields a large mace crackling with green undead energy.

(10+) Pursuing Hunger. You know the creature's melee attacks and its Bonus Actions.
(15+) Agile Attacker. You are aware of its highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
Ghouls are mindless and vicious. They charge towards enemies with an insatiable hunger for human flesh, and rarely flee from a fight. They can be easily distracted by a fresh corpse to eat, and follow the whims of their masters. The hungrier the ghoul is, the less mindful it is, and the more aggressive it becomes.
    Some vampires are known to starve their ghouls for months before unleashing them into battle. Although these ravenous ghouls are less coherent, their complete frenzied hunger makes them a much more dangerous threat.
    Ghoul priests and Ghoul Lords often accompany larger arrangements of ghouls to help focus them towards their vampire master's enemies. The priests keep them fighting through mortal wounds while Ghoul Lords lead the charge into combat.

    <description>The emaciated figure has ash-white skin and is completely hairless. The monster's eyes are two pools of abyssal blackness. Its fingers end in long points, and its teeth are jagged. It lurches away from a fresh corpse it was feasting upon, blood and gore dripping from its maw as it sniffs the air. Smelling something alive, it knows another meal is close by. Its gaze turns in your direction.

Clad in a torn smock and a rusted chain shirt, this muttering ghoul clutches a twisted, bone-carved symbol of Kromac, a representation of the blasphemous god of slaughter.

    <description>Towering over the furry horde around it, this ratling is nearly the size of an ogre. Its coarse and matted fur hangs in ragged patches, exposing sinewy muscles that ripple beneath its greasy skin. Oversized, jagged incisors protrude from its gnarled muzzle, and it brandishes its long, hooked claws slick with the dark sheen of old blood. Despite its bulk, the creature moves with an unsettling swiftness, its thick, scaly tail swaying menacingly to counterbalance the heavy thud of its gnarled paws.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Giant Ratling, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Furry Monstrosities. You understand these creatures have an excellent sense of smell, Darkvision, and are capable climbers and swimmers. They are Immune to Contamination, but have no other special Resistances.
(10+) Grab and Bash. You recognize the Giant Ratlings Hurl Ratling and Enrage actions.
(15+) Powerful but Dimwitted. You learn the creature's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Giant Ratling will charge any enemy it sees that threatens its burrow or gets in its way. The ratling will Enrage and start hurling other ratlings at its enemy as it charges forward, bearing down on the creature with claws and teeth. These brutes are relentless in their attacks, and generally much braver—or dumber—than other ratlings. They are unlikely to flee from harm. If the rest of the ratlings begin to flee, the Giant Ratling will follow, but it will usually be the last to turn tail as it enjoys pummeling and gnawing on flesh a bit too much.

Harvestable Components (Uncommon)
Animus: Monstrosity. Fluid: Monster Blood, Contaminated Ichor. Organs: Eyes, Heart, Brain, Guts, Flesh. Bones: Skull, Spine, Ribs. Natural Weapons: Claws, Teeth. Hair: Fur. Hide: Skin.

    <description>Walking through the rubble-strewn city streets, scraps of parchment and bits of faded street art still advertise the events, political intrigues, and foreign affairs of that fateful eve. Broadsheets from the day the meteor struck feature the headline "Queen Lenore's Latest Outfit: Blue or Gold?" while scandals of Elyrian nobility and an interview with the latest champion of the Rex Colosseum dominate below the fold. The nearby debris coalesces into a crowd of figures that press against you, seemingly straining to read the page's changing headline that now reads, "Adventurers Assaulted on the Streets of Drakkenheim!"

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Graffiti, learning the following based on the result.
(5+) Reforming Words. You learn of the creature's Regeneration ability.
(10+) Manifesting Visions. You recognize the creature's Summon Public Opinion and Transposition abilities.
(15+) Magical Erasure. You are aware of the creature's Solvent Susceptibility and Antimagic Susceptibility traits.

Combat Tactics
When a creature draws a Graffiti's attention, it uses illusions to confuse its targets. It then uses Summon Public Opinion and watches the drama unfold. To keep things interesting, the Graffiti uses its Transposition ability to see how creatures respond to situations when they're forced to approach them from new perspectives. 
    When the graffiti is in the heart of the action, it targets the most influential creature with Satire. Should the graffiti decide its target is sufficiently entertaining, or dangerous, it will flee the situation. If the graffiti is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it plays dead and then escapes at the first opportunity.

    <description>Before you is a hovering mass of writhing appendages. Amongst its horrid and grotesque form you can make out the many faces of the long-lost gravekeepers of Castle Drakken, but their expressions are twisted in the horror of their last moments, and their eyes are hollow with a dim octarine light emanating from within. Covering the floating mass are hundreds of arms, several of them holding softly glowing lanterns. The lanterns glow with octarine flames that cast flickering shadows across the crypt. The Gravekeeper wanders amongst the dead, awakening them into grasping souls, clawing their way out of the many graves amongst the lordly tombs of the castle.

    <description>A monumental behemoth casts a shadow across the broken ground ahead. It is a giant standing over fifty feet tall, but its form is a horrifying spectacle of mutation, with limbs grotesquely elongated and thickened, pulsing with a disturbing energy. Across its hulking body, sharp, glowing fragments of delerium are embedded deep within the flesh. The creature's small, sharp-featured face is set with piercing eyes that burn with a relentless, haunting glow, while its massive legs carry its enormous frame with a heavy, resonant tread that echoes ominously through the desolate landscape. Enormous, jagged claws protrude from its fingertips, dragging furrows into the earth as it moves, leaving a trail of shattered stone and upturned soil in its wake.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study a Grotesque Gargantuan, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Vanish into the Haze. You are aware of the Gargantuan's Misty Camouflage trait.
(15+) Crystal Missiles. You learn of the Gargantuan's Hurl Delerium attack.
(20+) Nearly Indestructible. You learn of its Regeneration trait.

Combat Tactics
Grotesque Gargantuans are violently territorial creatures. Unlike the randomly mutated creatures found throughout the Haze, these hideous entities are more in tune with the arcane elements of Drakkenheim. Their form appears more intentional, as does their purpose, though the truth behind this intention remains a mystery
    Gargantuans often drag chunks of delerium along with them, and their massive arms can swing or throw them with ease. They place the stones in odd formations around the city and, if witnessed by another creature who isn't a Dreg or a Haze Hulk, they will violently lash out and chase the observer down. The Gargantuan hurls huge boulders of delerium at them. Whatever their intention is, they will not abandon their territory, or their work, and rarely flee from the site they are working in.

It opens its mouth as it lets out a gurgling moan, and it reaches into one of its open sores, pulling out a pile of pus-covered contaminated meat. It rears back to hurl the fetid flesh at you.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study a Gutbuster Hulk, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Gout of Acid. You recognize the Gutbuster Hulk's Bile Blast attack.
(15+) Cancerous Growths. You learn of the Gutbuster Hulk's Hurl Fetid Flesh attack.
(20+) Strong and Tough. You are aware of the Hulk's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Gutbuster is a massive, bloated hulk that constantly grows fleshy masses within its ever expanding belly. If left unchecked, a Gutbuster Hulk can grow to proportions so large that it crushes itself under its own weight. Ratlings love when this happens — it supplies them with food for weeks.
    The Gutbuster maintains its form by ripping chunks of flesh from its body, hurling them at enemies. This contaminated flesh erupts in a shower of gore and necrotic fluids. A Gut- buster usually opens with this attack to ward off foes, and then waits for more flesh to grow to hurl it again. If its enemies close in around it, it uses its Bile Blast to coat the creatures in acid, or will Slam them with its massive fists. 
    The Gutbuster is slower moving than other Haze Hulks and rarely runs from a fight.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study a Gutwretch Dreg, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Vigilant Protector. You are aware of the Gutwretch Dregs' Reactive trait.
(10+) Toppling Attacker. You recognize the Dreg's Gut Flail attack.
(15+) Strong and Agile. You learn the Dreg's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Gutwretch Dreg keeps its distance from other combatants, watching all creatures who dare approach while swinging its flail over its head. It often protects other Dregs, standing watch over them while they eat or tend to other matters.
    The Dreg uses its Reactive trait, as well as its Flailing Guts Reaction to knock creatures out of its way the moment they come near. It will always try to move away from direct combat, preferring to keep its enemies at arm's length so it can continue to pummel them with its Gut Flail.
    The Gutwretch Dreg will fight to protect its fellow Dregs and is often the last one to flee from combat.

    <description>This hulking mutant stands over ten feet tall, its swollen body grown beyond normal human proportions. Its rippling muscles and engorged veins pulse beneath its thin discolored skin. The hulk's flesh has split open in places over its body, barely able to contain the bulging and expanding sinew of its tree-trunk-like limbs and wide torso. Its head, however, is strangely small given the size of its body, though it wears a furious expression upon its broad, flat face. Plodding toward you on thumping, gigantic feet, it curls its massive hands into a cannonball-like fist. Letting out a fierce roar, it reveals its jagged rows of teeth and elongated tongue.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study a Haze Hulk, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Nearly Unkillable. You know of the creature's Mutant Fortitude trait.
(15+) Crushing Move. You recognize the Hulk's Trample attack.
(20+) Strong and Tough. You learn the Hulk's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Haze Hulks are often found amongst other Dregs; they have the same general disposition and similar qualities as a common Delerium Dreg. However, when agitated or threatened, a Haze Hulk's ferocity outshines the Dreg's by a long shot. It will attack any creature it sees as a threat to itself or its fellow Dregs. The Haze Hulk will barrel in head first towards its foes, attempting to Trample them, slamming them with its massive fists. It is a relentless attacker and rarely flees from combat.

    <description>The walking dead wander Drakkenheim draped in the ragged clothes from their final day. Their wounds billow with eldritch energy and their putrid flesh slides over their bones. Hollow black eyes stare, and their gaping mouths groan in pain. Each face wears the agony of their last moments while shards of delerium protrude from their skin.

Reanimated by the Haze
Left undisturbed in the ruins of Drakkenheim, the corpse of a humanoid character of 5th level (or Challenge Rating 5) or lower has a 10 percent chance each day of rising as a Haze Husk.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to Study a Haze Husk, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Unintelligent Undead. You know these creatures are clumsy, relatively weak, and nearly mindless.
(15+) Volatile Shards. You are aware of the Haze Husk's Death Burst.
(20+) Made With Delerium. You understand that it's possible to create these zombies with delerium and a Create Dead spell (see the Creating Haze Husks sidebar).
(25+) Blind to Contamination. Haze Husks seem to ignore contaminated monsters. Perhaps a partially mutated person might avoid a Haze Husk's attention.

Combat Tactics
In combat, Haze Husks lunge at the closest target without tactics or concern for self-preservation, battering down doors and clambering over obstacles in pursuit. When commanded by other undead or a spellcaster who created them, they are somewhat more capable, and can be ordered to remain at heel.
    A character with one or more Contamination levels and at least one mutation may be able to pass themselves off as a contaminated monster to a Haze Husk. Doing so successfully requires a DC 15 Charisma (Performance or Deception) check, which Charms the Haze Husk for 1 minute.

Harvestable Components (Common)
Animus: Undead. Fluid: Contaminated Ichor. Bones: Skull, Spine, Ribs. Hair: Hair. Hide: Skin. Dust: Undead Dust. Delerium. Characters may be able to collect delerium from the remains of the Haze Husk, though its destruction tends to cause any fragments or chips to shatter and break. Roll 1d6 to determine what the characters can find. 1-3: nothing remains but broken splinters and ash; 4: 1d4 delerium chips; 5: 1d3 delerium fragments; 6: 1 delerium shard.

Creating Haze Husks
A character who knows the Animate Dead spell can consume a delerium fragment worth at least 100 gp per corpse as part of casting the spell to animate them as Haze Husks. Additionally, a character who uses a delerium crystal worth at least 1,000 gp per corpse when casting Create Undead with a level 8 spell slot or higher can animate two Haze Wights, or three Haze Wights by using a level 9 spell slot.

    <description>The Haze transformed Queen Lenore into a monster. She stands six feet tall, clad in a once-opulent green dress adorned with gold filigree, now muddied and tattered. She wears an astonishing but tarnished golden necklace set with eleven emeralds. Her long, thin limbs and chalky skin are cracked and rigid like stone, and her hair is a writhing mass of thick, wet, tendrils, each ending in a toothy maw.

Curing Lenore's contamination is a vexing problem. Due to her madness, she manipulates any who try to help, twisting them to further her contaminated power. As Lenore's mutations evolve, she may become an even greater threat than before.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I speak softly imagining myself to be in a tragic fairytale while casting others in fictional roles.
• Ideal. The world is a mirror held to my glorious reflection.
• Bond. I obsessively crave beauty, decadence, and relish all art. I especially love my garden and my lilies. They are all I have left.
• Flaw. I fly into an enraged fury at the sight of my own likeness or the names of my lost family members.

Reanimated by the Haze
Left undisturbed in the ruins of Drakkenheim, the corpse of a humanoid character of 6th level (or Challenge Rating 6) or higher has a 10 percent chance each day of rising as a Haze Wight

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to Study a Haze Wight, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Delusional Undead. You recognize that these creatures think they are still alive, and that we are the monsters!
(15+) Contaminated Eldritch Power. You are aware of the Haze Wight's Contaminated Blast.
(20+) Awaken Minions. You know of the creature's Animate Haze Husk Bonus Action.
(25+) Made With Delerium. You understand that it's possible to create these zombies with delerium and an Animate Dead spell (see the Creating Haze Husks sidebar).

Combat Tactics
Haze Wights are intelligent warriors who can engage in melee or ranged combat. However, they mistakenly believe their foes are mindless monsters not requiring careful tactics, seeing most targets as beasts to be put down. When a foe demonstrates unexpected magic or strategy, some fight more carefully, commanding minions to surround and corner their opponents.
    Groups of these wights sometimes believe they are still-living, acting as if they still possess their former abilities, using teamwork and 'healing' each other by reanimating the fallen as Haze Husks. Nevertheless, their delusions render them incapable of imagining defeat; they do not flee when wounded, nor when allies fall. Instead, they believe they fight in a heroic last stand, desperately railing against the inevitable doom they already suffered.

Harvestable Components (Uncommon)
Animus: Undead. Fluid: Contaminated Ichor. Bones: Skull, Spine, Ribs. Hair: Hair. Hide: Skin. Dust: Undead Dust.

Additionally, a character who uses a delerium crystal worth at least 1,000 gp per corpse when casting Create Undead with a level 8 spell slot or higher can animate two Haze Wights, or three Haze Wights by using a level 9 spell slot.

    <description>The crone perches atop a stoop, its elegant wings unfurl, revealing a massive, 12-foot wingspan that vividly shimmers green, blue, violet, and gold. Unlike most harpies, it lacks arms. Its taloned feet clutch its perch, while matted, white hair falls upon wrinkled, sagging flesh. Sitting atop a long neck, its face seems distorted, bearing a hooked nose and pointed chin—its grin too wide, its teeth too sharp, and its eyes too large and white. Adorned with feathered necklaces, earrings, and a crown of golden ivy, it sings a chorus of unsettling notes, seemingly glowing with radiant light.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a crone, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Inherently Magical. You know of the creature's damage Immunities.
(10+) Dangerous Melodies. You are aware of its Crone Songs action.
(15+) Entrancing but Weak. You know the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
The Hazewind Harpy Crone avoids direct combat. Her songs have a great range, allowing her to perch atop hard-to-reach places, while her songs help her more combat-focused sisters in battle. These songs empower ally attacks, while the Breakneck Hymns increase the falling damage of plummeting enemies. If creatures come too close, she may use her Mesmerizing Melody and move elsewhere.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Hazewind Harpy Hunter, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Agile Flier. You learn of the creature's Aerial Maneuver Bonus Action.
(10+) Dangerous Song. You know the creature's Chorus ability.
(15+) Sturdy and Agile. You recognize the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
Harpies hunt in small flocks, and always attack from the sky or an overhead vantage point using their longbows. They engage in melee only to make the killing blow on a wounded target. When confronted with a foe able to make effective ranged attacks, harpies become much more cautious. Accurate shots from the ground or an exploding airborne Fireball may be enough alone to shake their resolve, causing them to fly off in search of easier prey.

(10+) Dangerous Talons. You recognize the creature's Pluck trait.
(15+) Strong and Agile. You know the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
The Hazewind Harpy Valkyrie are the chosen warriors of the Crimson Countess, and they are skilled with both their weapons and their talons. They wield barbed javelins and a shield in their hands, and leave their taloned feet open to pluck people off the ground and toss them. They often attempt to lure foes into elevated positions, such as rooftops, cliffs, or balconies, and then pluck them up and toss them to their death.
    If they find themselves grounded, or outnumbered they will attempt to escape and fly to the highest location nearby to guard themselves and better defend against attackers.

    <description>Rounding the corner, you stumble upon a bizarre alleyway where streaks of delerium cling to the walls like trellised vines. Criss-crossing the thoroughfare like laundry lines are elegant silk strands. Nestled into the corners and crevasses are tightly wrapped, pulsating cocoons and masses of glittering eggs. Several massive caterpillars with strange multicolored bodies clutch to the delerium, gnawing at the crystals with their disturbing mandibles, when suddenly a fluttering flock of large moths with opalescent wings descend from above.

This large moth has brilliantly patterned wings that glimmer purple and green. The delicate membranes feature hypnotic shapes that resemble screaming human faces. The creature has a grotesque bat-like face with a curved antenna sprouting from its forehead ending in a bioluminescent lantern that gives off splashes of prismatic light. Its eyes are a mosaic-like fractal, and delerium dust drifts around it as it flaps about.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Hazewing Moth Adult, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Vulnerable Flier. You know this flying creature has no special Resistances or Immunities.
(10+) Mesmeric Moth. You learn of the creature's Delerium Dust action and Hypnotic Flutter Bonus Action.
(15+) Intellect Eater. You recognize the moth's deadly Proboscis attack, and its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Adult Hazewing Moths are protective of the eggs, caterpillars, and cocoons of others of their kind, and use their abilities to defend the clutch. The moths use their Hypnotic Flutter and Delerium Dust to send their targets into a near catatonic state before they flutter down to drink the target's psychic energy using their Proboscis.

    <description>Rounding the corner, you stumble upon a bizarre alleyway where streaks of delerium cling to the walls like trellised vines. Criss-crossing the thoroughfare like laundry lines are elegant silk strands. Nestled into the corners and crevasses are tightly wrapped, pulsating cocoons and masses of glittering eggs. Several massive caterpillars with strange multicolored bodies clutch to the delerium, gnawing at the crystals with their disturbing mandibles, when suddenly a fluttering flock of large moths with opalescent wings descend from above.

The undulating body of this monstrous caterpillar bristles with sharp, luminescent spines. The creature's skin is a disturbing tapestry of purples and greens, throbbing with an eerie, bioluminescent glow.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Hazewing Moth Caterpillar, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Death Bite. This aberrant caterpillar has a dangerous necrotic bite.
(15+) Crystalline Craving. The caterpillar hungers for delerium crystals, which may divert its attention.

Combat Tactics
A Hazewing Moth Caterpillar is always seeking its next meal and attacks without discretion, wriggling towards the closest target to Bite them. The caterpillars continue to eat and Bite a downed character even in combat if they aren't being actively attacked. While it's happy to consume living flesh, a Hazewing Caterpillar is eager to feed on delerium. Characters may be able to draw its attention or even render it docile by offering it a shard or two and making a successful DC 15 Animal Handling check.

Thick silvery strands fasten this bulbous glowing cocoon against a nearby wall. Within its crystalline shell, something pulses with unnerving, face-like patterns. These spectral visages seem to gasp and moan in silence. A thin mist rises off the surface of the chrysalis.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Hazewing Moth Chrysalis, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Protective Chrysalis. You understand the creature's Immunities and its Anchored trait.
(10+) Haze Amplifier. You are aware of its Haze Aura trait.
(15+) Adult Emergence. You learn of the creature's Sudden Emergence Reaction.

Combat Tactics
Immobile and incapable of attacking directly, the chrysalis simply holds fast while using Harden. Note that the Haze Auras of multiple chrysalis do not stack.

    <description>The bloated demon lord descends, his wings unfurling like a curtain falling at the end of a tragedy. Holding a skull in one clawed hand, he is garbed in black-and-white checkered patterns, featuring a great belt of skulls and a frilled doublet made from finger bones. The skin upon his leering face has peeled away, revealing a mask-like goat skull beneath which frowns on one side and grins on the other. His appearance is almost like that of a great, macabre clown. His bellowing laughter resounds in your ears, stirs the blood, shakes the bones, and chills the soul.

Roleplaying Traits
Adventurers who interact with He Who Laughs Last must endure his mocking laughter and jeering comments, as he remarks on the futility of their actions, the dramatic irony of their mistakes, and the meaninglessness of their quests. In doing so, He Who Laughs Last carefully offers an escape or solution—if the adventurers will offer him service in exchange, one that is almost certain to have unforeseen consequences.
• Personality Traits. In conversation, I cannot contain my dark mirth, which manifests from a low chuckle to a belly-bursting guffaw. Most of all, I love the moment when mortals realize the cost of their terrible mistakes and poor decisions.
• Ideal. Mortals fear death. I play upon that fear, and with it I can catch the conscience of any soul.
• Bond. I harvest souls at life's curtain call, binding them to my cast of players in my Theatre of the Danse Macabre.
• Flaw. I oft direct the play too long, delighting in extending the final act. My patience is as deep as the grave, allowing me to savor each move in the mortal game, though sometimes to the detriment of a timely demise.
He Who Laughs Last loves nothing more than when mortal heroes attempt to outmaneuver him. As befitting his name, there is almost always some unfortunate upset or surprise twist the demon has in store. Even when he is seemingly defeated, he is always sure to remind his foes who will have the last laugh.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when they take the Study action to examine He Who Laughs Last, learning the following based on the result:
(20+) Powerful Demonlord. You are aware of his Truesight and telepathy, his Resistances and Immunities, and his Epic Resistance. You also know this eldritch entity is beyond life and death and can reform years later if killed.
(25+) Killing Aura. You know of his Mortal Coil aura, and his spellcasting Epic Actions.
(30+) Powerful Presence. You know his highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
He Who Laughs Last approaches battle lazily, as his mere presence causes mortals to die in short order from his Mortal Coil aura. Nevertheless, he casually ends lives using Sleep No More, Dusty Death, and Out Brief Candle, trapping another foe in a Cage of Sorrows so they must bear witness to the death around them before they expire to his Mortal Coil.
    He Who Laughs Last does not fear his own destruction, confident that he will reappear if his corporeal form is 
destroyed. He is certain of his fate to watch the end of the universe, and even when slain his echoing laughter remains as a grim reminder of his power.

Player Character Familiars
Subject to GM approval, an apothecary with the Laboratory Assistant esoteric theory can create a Helpful Hand or Speaking Skull to serve them using the Find Familiar spell. A familiar created in this manner always acts in combat immediately after its creator's turn. It can use its special attacks in its stat block only if the apothecary uses a Bonus Action on their turn to command the familiar to take one of those actions.

    <description>A stout woman in her late forties with rich brown skin stands invitingly before you. Her warm smile is framed by rounded features and braided hair. She wears the flowing gold and white robes of a Flamekeeper of the Sacred Flame. She carries a silvered staff and a censer with a Continual Flame spell cast upon it.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I attentively listen to others and respond from a place of warmth and kindness.
• Ideal. I will always seek the right remedy for any ailment or problem, offering my patient guidance to those who ask for it.
• Bond. I have taken a vow of poverty and devoted my life to the service of the Sacred Flame.
• Flaw. Darkness is all-consuming once it has taken root. For some, death is the only salvation.

Combat Tactics
Ophelia is a powerful divine figure and is often accompanied by many Silver Order paladins and cavaliers. In combat she often defaults to buffing her allies more so than attacking directly, but will use her spiritual weapon liberally against foes who threaten her. If she can end an encounter using Banishment or Dispel Magic, she will opt for that. Otherwise she relies on Bless, Guidance, and Healing Word to keep her allies in the fight. She will flee if her paladin knights demand her to, or if most of them have been slain or she is left alone in a threatening situation.

    <description>Hooded Lantern Apothecaries are the Lanterns' field medics. Called Apothecaries, they are distinct from other Hooded Lanterns, often wearing a white tunic with a simple green Hooded Lanterns insignia. They have a leather hood and typically carry a large doctor bag and a bandelier of vials for various ailments or poisons. They carry several medical instruments on their belt.

Combat Tactics
The Hooded Lanterns rarely go into a fight without a plan. They set up ambushes, tailoring an encounter to put them at an advantage. They know their territory and can navigate the ruins of the city with relative ease compared to most adventurers who journey into Drakkenheim. They travel in well-equipped groups, and often carry tools to alert other nearby scouting parties if they need help.
    The Hooded Lanterns are skilled archers. They often occupy rooftops and ruined towers. If they expect combat to occur, they position soldiers with bows in any nearby vantage points with a clear view of their allies down on the streets. They place scouts in ruined buildings to keep eyes on the streets and run for aid if combat breaks out. The Lanterns lay traps and ambushes before their enemies have entered the area. Hooded Lanterns are often incredibly prepared and use the ruins as camouflage for their attack.

    <description>Fungus Trolls are most prominently found in the Trogrowth Forest of Caspia but are also known to inhabit prominent wetlands and swamps within the continent. They are one of the most problematic troll groups known in the world. Their ability to produce new trolls en masse is staggering. Not only do the hags who tend to fungal gardens create hundreds of them at a time, but the Fungus Trolls can grow to such massive sizes, that their lumbering presence shakes the very trees of the swamps they inhabit. These massive fungal monstrosities rain down spores that grow into Fungal Trollings. These networks of Fungus Trolls travel together. When you see one Humongous Fungus Troll barreling towards you, be warned that there are likely more following.

Swampland Protectors. Humongous Fungus Trolls stand as the guardians of their swamps. They do not cater to trespassers of any kind. Loyal to their Troll Hag mothers, they defend their fungal farms and wander the swamps spreading their spores as they go. 

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Humongous Fungus Troll, learning the following information based on the result:
(5+) From Harsh Environments. You know the troll's Spore Slam and Grasping Tendrils Actions. 
(10+) Hard to Kill. You learn of the troll's Regeneration trait. 
(15+) Special Weakness. You have insight into the troll's Vulnerabilities.

Combat Tactics
Humongous Fungus Trolls remain motionless and observe trespassers to see if they are a threat. If combat is initiated, the Humongous Fungus Troll uses its Grasping Tendrils to pull victims towards it, then uses its Entangling Mycelia to entangle as many creatures as possible within its Rotting Aura.

(20+) Strong and Tough. You are aware of the Hulk's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Hunter Hulks hide in the ruins of Drakkenheim, often Invisible, attempting to get the drop on their prey. Once the Hulk's target is in a prime position, it lunges out and whips its arms around them, pulling in the unfortunate target. The Hunter Hulk then devours them with its Belly Maw. If the creature breaks free, or if the Hunter Hulk is being too heavily damaged, it turns Invisible again and slinks back into the shadows. However, the Hunter Hulk will not so easily give up on its prey, and it may stalk the target and their party for a time, looking for a better moment to strike again. Sometimes it launches another ambush almost immediately, other times it will stalk them for several hours.

    <description>The multi-colored petals of this large lotus-like flower gently open. Light dances across its leaves and shimmering blossom in a strange hypnotic rhythm. The colors seem to shift as it moves, at times creating unimaginable colors. As you gaze at it, maddening patterns fill your mind, and a wave of confusion sweeps over you, making it impossible to tell if your glance was for but a moment or a lifetime.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks to Study a Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Slow Moving Plant. You're aware of the plants movement, Resistances, and Immunities.
(10+) Enchanted Blossoms. You learn of its Hypnotic Pollen action and Spell Reflection Reaction.
(15+) Tough and Unthinking. You recognize the blossom's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
These plants typically grow in places protected from easy access, such as a pool of contaminated water, and they weaponize their environment against threats. The blossom attempts to contaminate victims with its nectar and uses the surroundings to amplify the danger of contamination. The flower is not agile enough to escape attacks, and relies on its Hypnotic Pollen to keep itself alive. Hypnotized victims view the flower as an impossibly beautiful object and are lured into any nearby hazards.

    <description>This lithe, 8-foot-tall creature has an array of tanks and hoses connected to four mechanical limbs that end in massive syringes, filled with all manner of toxins, contagions, and afflictions. Beady white eyes glare at you from its bald head. No mouth is visible, instead, it wears a hose-connected mask and several magnifying lenses that can be slotted over its eyes for surgical precision.

Different Injectors for Different Practices. Injectors are a common creation for Reanimators, often constructed from stitched-together body parts and medical instruments welded into the flesh, but both Chemists and Pathogenists also create Injectors. Reanimators use Injectors as assistants to administer paralysis, mind dampening, and even adrenaline into their creations, hoping to keep subjects alive during intense procedures. Pathogenists use Injectors to deliver deadly viruses, poisons, and diseases. Chemists have been known to use Injectors for mixing alchemical formulae in case problems arise and cause unforeseen accidents—it's better you blow up an assistant than yourself.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine or Survival gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study an Injector, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Impervious to Pain. You understand the creature's damage and condition Immunities.
(15+) Be careful, it's volatile! You know of its Unstable Tank Reaction.
(20+) Hardy Creature. You are aware of the Injector's AC, Hit Points, and weakest ability score and saving throw.

Combat Tactics
If the Injector has allies nearby, it uses Booster Dose to bolster them before combat. Otherwise, it ruthlessly attacks with its Syringe Arms. It feels no pain and does not waver or retreat.

    <description>These small mannequins are cobbled together from wood, clay, and scrap metal. Visible tubes pump blood through their lithe forms. Garbed in scavenged clothing and wigs, many resemble human children, while some appear like deformed stuffed animals or dolls. Some especially macabre specimens are built with flesh, including painted masks as faces. Each has a single hand replaced with an array of scissors and scalpels, while the other holds an extractor or syringe. Several are equipped with small satchels or bloodied bags that they drag behind them. Some carry ragged stuffed animals filled with pockets. All bags are filled with dismembered body parts, bits of bone, flesh, organs, eyes, and other parts they bring back to their masters.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study an
Innocent Harvester, learning the following based on the result:

(12+) Clamber and Leap. You are aware of the Innocent Harvester's Leap.
(15+) Simple Construct. You know the Innocent Harvester's mental saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Though small and innocent in appearance, Innocent Harvesters are not defenseless. They are fast and agile, equipped with surgical tools in place of one hand and a syringe in the other. Made to subdue trespassers, or remove body parts from corpses, these unflinching minions will not hesitate to leap atop targets. However, they are more comfortable hiding and fleeing than fighting. Their job is to collect body parts. If threatened, they leap onto a target and begin using their surgical tools on them. Harvesters attempt to sedate wounded targets and flee.

    <description>A creature of nearly impossible proportions and colors steps through a tear in the fabric of reality. It has spindly limbs that end in three sharp digits, attaching to a tubular stalk of a body. Opening within its form is a long, toothy maw lined with tiny undulating tentacles. A faint gurgling sound emanates from the creature. You feel hunger, but strangely, you realize it is not your own hunger, but that of the creature clattering towards you.

Drawn to Magic. Interlopers crave magic, especially delighting in extracting the arcane power wielded by warlocks. They latch onto the connection between a warlock and their patron, attempting to follow that connection into the Material plane where they lie in wait for their victim.

Clustered Predators. Interlopers seldom appear alone, preferring to attack in groups of three or more. Occasionally, they have been observed to bicker, fighting each other for the largest share of the spoils.

Spell Snatchers. Interlopers are feared by spellcasters because of their ability to Siphon Spells thrown at them. Once spellcasters recognize an area is infested with these creatures, they often commission Paladins of the Silver Order or grizzled monster hunters to hunt them down

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to study an Interloper, revealing the following based on their result:
(10+) Multidimensional Senses. You recognize the creature's Blindsight trait.
(15+) Magical Entity. You are aware of its Siphon Spell ability.
(20+) Agile and Cunning. You know the Interloper's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
An Interloper has only one objective, to feast on the spellcaster's magic that attracted it, and then to return to whence it came. It pursues the nearest spellcaster, prioritizing warlocks, assailing them until they are dead, or the caster's magic is spent it Teleports to evade physical attacks. If an Interloper drops below 10 Hit Points, it will Plane Shift, retreating into the
Space Between Worlds to recover, seeking to return to feast again, likely in greater numbers.

    <description>The creature is composed of rippling muscles, with leather straps holding in place rusted pieces of armor forming a pauldron, bracers, and belt. Its head is enclosed in a massive metal dome with no discernible face. Still, the creature's heavy breathing can be heard from within the dome and it seems completely aware of its surroundings. In each hand it carries a makeshift metal blade, made from scrap beams from a house, or possibly the remnants of an old door, or part of a wagon. It's clearly filed these metal scraps to a fine blade caked in rust and dried blood.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study a Juggernaut Hulk, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Pure Destruction. You know of its Out of My Way trait.
(15+) Rusted Blades. You learn of the Juggernaut's Whirlwind action and Rip and Tear Bonus Action.
(20+) Renewing Flesh. You recognize its Regeneration trait.

Combat Tactics
The Juggernaut Hulk barrels forward in combat, slamming foes out of its way and swinging its blades wildly. Its main tactic is to knock enemies down and then drive its blades into them, bisecting them on the spot. The Juggernaut Hulk does not flee and seems to shrug off most injuries. It will fight until its last breath with determination and ferocity.

    <description>The patchwork form of the hydra appears to be fused together with metal scrap, and spare parts from large monstrosities. Its flesh is pale and discolored, with multicolored scales that have lost their luster over time. In many places patches of scales are missing entirely. The creature's multiple heads are all surgically attached, with milky white eyes placed in old and rotting sockets. Foul chemicals pump through the creature's body causing glowing veins to show through the places where its scales are the most thinned. Sickly green salvia drips from the many and varied mouths of its lizard heads.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine, Arcana, or Survival gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study the Kingkiller Hydra, learning the following based on the result:
(15+) Lab Construct. You recognize the creature's type, its Resistances, and Immunities.
(20+) Barrage of Bites. You learn of the creature's Hydra Fury Epic Action.
(24+) Head Regrowth. You are aware of the creature's Multiple Heads trait.

Combat Tactics
The Kingkiller Hydra is relentless. It attacks with all its heads against any target in range. If there is distance between it and its foes, it Tramples them before unleashing Bite attacks with its heads, or it Spits Acid at them from afar while closing the distance. If the hydra takes 75 or more Fire damage in a single round, it attempts to flee.

    <description>Theodore Marshal is athletic and tall with boldly sculpted features, bronzed skin, and unkempt sandy brown hair. Unshaven stubble has grown into a beard over the criss-cross of scars on his face. A leather eye patch covers his right eye. He wears gleaming silver plate armor etched with golden trim, and carries a shimmering sword and a broad shield engraved with the symbol of the Sacred Flame.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. Honorable. I treat all matters with great honor and respect, and I stand up for what I believe. I expect others to act similarly, respecting any who match my ideals and honor.
• Ideal. Tradition. I uphold the traditions of the Sacred Flame and the Silver Order. I take pride in my standing within the Order and the responsibilities that befall my position.
• Bond. I am willing to lay down my life to reclaim the lost relics in Drakkenheim and sanctify the cathedral. I know that there is no cost too great if it means purging the world of the filth of this blighted city.
• Flaw. I trust those of my order and faith, and I believe whatever commands come from my superiors. I hesitate to trust those who do not swear to my faith, as there can be no other way than to follow its teachings.

Combat Tactics.
Honorable to a fault, Theodore Marshal will always entertain parley and accept surrender, even if he doesn't expect the same from his foes. If it comes to blows, Theodore Marshal charges into battle and strikes hard with his warhammer, setting his enemies alight with Searing Smite. Well aware of the dangers of spellcasters and monsters, he uses Call The Sacred Flame to blind them so he can engage in melee with impunity.

Six skittering legs hold up its sprawling torso resembling the thorax and abdomen of a massive cockroach. Its chitinous shell gleams with a sickly sheen, a pair of long twitching antennae sprout from its head, and its arms end in clawed, human-like hands. Small oculi dot its forehead surrounding large compound eyes. Opening its mouth reveals not a tongue, but horrific mandibles. Countless small cockroaches dart among weeping holes covering its torso.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Kronen, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Infected Vermin. You are aware of the creature's Infestation Reaction.
(10+) Speed and Dread. You learn of the creature's Loathsome Presence action and Scuttle Bonus Action.
(15+) Broken Personality. You understand the creature's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
A Kronen is usually agitated and alarmed when encountered, and its first instinct in combat is to find a new hiding place or flee deeper into its lair. It uses its Loathsome Presence while clawing at any in the way of its escape using Scuttle, reflexively spreading roaches to attackers via its Infestation Reaction.
    If it escapes, a Kronen is eventually drawn to return to its old hiding place. Should characters remain there, the Kronen will furiously attack to reclaim its shelter but won't pursue characters who leave it alone in its hideout.

    <description>The creature glows with a pallid, soft light. At times it gives off-hues of purples, oranges, and greens, but on occasion the color seems wholly indescribable. Its mouth hangs wide open, that same glow emerging brighter from its gullet, and its eyes shine like two lanterns as it surveys the area around it, drawn to the contaminating energies around it.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study a Lambent Dreg, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Drawn to Contamination. You are aware of the Dreg's Arcane Hunger trait.
(10+) Urge to Contaminate. You know of the Lambent Dreg's Octarine Beam and Wave of Contamination attacks.
(15+) Smart and Cunning. You learn of the Lambent Dreg's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Lambent Dregs tend to gather around delerium clusters throughout the city, often appearing in groups in highly contaminated areas. Creatures who have Contamination levels are prime targets for Lambent Dregs. The Dregs chase them down, avoiding non-contaminated targets when possible. 
    If threatened, Lambent Dregs run into the middle of a group of enemies and expel their Wave of Contamination, attempting to render their foes into a state of contamination, allowing the Dreg to easily engage with them. 
    Lambent Dregs flee if outnumbered and in a losing situation.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to Study a Last Memory, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Deathless Memory. You know the creature's monster type, Resistances, and Immunities
(10+) Painful Recall. You are aware of the creature's Anguish action.
(15+) Weak Undead. You learn the creature's ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Last Memories can move along the ground or up walls, often hiding as shadows on the ground. They have even followed prey, appearing as a strange movement in one's peripheral vision, or a shifting shadow from an unknown source.
    When they reveal themselves, Lost Memories cry out in anguish, causing those nearby to suffer visions of their last moments, inducing emotional trauma to any who succumb to it. They grasp those nearby, terrorizing them with waves of sorrow. Last Memories seem to embody the raw emotions of their death, using those emotions as weapons against the living. They do not flee, for they do not cherish their existence. Their only purpose is to spread the fear and the pain of their own death before fading away, only to reappear days later to relive their agony.

Her long, thin limbs and chalky skin are cracked and rigid like stone, and her hair is a writhing mass of thick, wet, tendrils, each ending in a toothy maw.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I speak softly imagining myself to be in a tragic fairytale while casting others in fictional roles.
• Ideal. The world is a mirror held to my glorious reflection.
• Bond. I obsessively crave beauty, decadence, and relish all art. I especially love my garden and my lilies. They are all I have left.
• Flaw. I fly into an enraged fury at the sight of my own likeness or the names of my lost family members.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Insight gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study Queen Lenore, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Mutated Queen of Drakkenheim. You recognize she is an Aberration.
(15+) Deadly Gaze. You learn of her Radiant Gaze ability.
(20+) Formidable Foe. You understand her highest and lowest saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Lenore does not often outright engage in combat, throwing Dregs and her handmaidens at enemies who threaten her. She prefers to stay behind her minions where she is safe, relying on her Radiant Gaze to slowly disable and contaminate her foes. 
    If forced into melee, she uses her Tentacle Hair to attack and will take the first opportunity to escape if she can.

Harvestable Components (Rare)
Animus: Aberration. Fluid: Monster Blood, Contaminated Ichor. Organs: Eyes, Heart, Brain, Guts, Flesh. Bones: Skull, Spine, Ribs. Natural Weapons: Tentacles. Hide: Skin. Dust: Aberrant Dust.

Petra Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I see the value in those willing to risk their lives in the ruins. I have great insight and trust in my own judgment of character.
• Ideal. The right path is often the harder path, but it is always one worth walking.
• Bond. I was adopted by Elias Drexel, who raised and trained me. I don't want to let him down.
• Flaw. I am too open and trusting of people who claim to be on the same side as me, and I put a lot of weight in counting on people who I assume are able to handle themselves.

Combat Tactics
Petra is a skilled archer and skirmisher. She prefers to keep her foes at range to gain a vantage point over them in combat. She is a cunning scout who is more likely to set up an ambush than attack directly. When pinned down, she tries to move out of melee into a more advantageous position. If she is low on options, she attempts to escape.

Its many spider-like eyes glowing with incomprehensible colors, its flesh changing shape and color in dizzying displays. It whispers in the minds of those who approach it, telling them great truths of unknown worlds, and announcing the coming of its nameless masters.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Liminal Herald, learning the following based on the result.
(10+) Guarded Existence. You learn the creature's Immunities.
(15+) Psychic Retribution. You know of the creature's Reflect Pain Reaction.
(20+) Weak but Perceptive. They learn the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
The Liminal Herald is a contaminated entity from the deepest corners of the Space Between Worlds. It undoes creatures atom by atom with its Eldritch Beams. It targets the intellect of other creatures with its Mind Scramble, especially spellcasters concentrating on spells. The Liminal Herald harnesses the very fabric of magic itself and uses that force against mortals who would
attempt to dabble in it. 
    When targeted by an attack, the Liminal Herald bends space and time around it using its Reflect Pain feature, causing the creature who attacked it to take on a mental payload of pain felt by the creature.
    If it is reduced below half its Hit Points, the Liminal Herald attempts to flee.

      <name>Epic Foe</name>
      <text>This is an epic foe, following the rules as described in Pluto Jackson's Monsters of Drakkenheim.

To calculate its Max HP use the following calculation: 70 (4d20 + 28) + 70 per player character (4d20 + 28).</text>

      <name>No Exit</name>
      <text>When it rolls for Initiative, the living city reflexively closes the windows, doors, and other egress points on the outside of its body, preventing creatures inside it from leaving its space. 
    A creature in the living city's space that attempts to leave its space using teleportation or planar travel is subjected to the following effect. Charisma Saving Throw: DC 20. Failure: 27 (5d10) Psychic damage. Failure or Success: The teleportation or planar travel fails.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>False Appearance</name>
      <text>While the living city remains motionless in its Structural Form, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary structure or vehicle, such as a house or a sailing ship.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Structural Form</name>
      <text>The living city can spend 10 minutes in Concentration to shape-shift into a Gargantuan structure or back into its true, amorphous form. Its game statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. 
    While in the form of a structure, the living city takes up its entire space and creates floors, walls, doorways, and windows within its space which resemble and behave like normal structures, while leaving behind open space within it to create rooms. Creatures can pass through the open spaces and stop there as if moving through a normal structure. 
    The walls and floors of the living city can be damaged and thus breached. Each 5-foot-by-5-foot section has AC 15 and 30 Hit Points. Reducing a section to 0 Hit Points destroys it and deals 30 damage to the living city. A living city can only take this damage once per turn. 
    In addition, the living city extrudes pieces of itself inside its space which resemble furnishings and everyday objects. The extrusions appear, feel, sound, and behave exactly like the mimicked objects. A thin, slimy tendril connects any furnishings or objects to the body of the living city. The tendril has AC 15 and 1 Hit Point. If the tether is severed or destroyed, the simulacra melts into goo, but does no harm to the living city.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>

      <name>Epic Actions</name>
      <text>The living city always takes its turn on Initiative count 20. On its turn, the living city can use its movement and interaction as normal. However, it does not take an action or Bonus Action on its turn unless forced to do so by a spell or other effect. Instead, the living city takes one of the following Epic Actions at the end of each player character's turn:</text>
    </action>

      <attack>Psychic Damage||3d6</attack>
    </action>
    <action>
      <name>Shifting Form</name>
      <text>The living city alters the composition of a 10-foot-by-10-foot area inside it, creating walls, doors, windows, stairs, or furnishings. It can choose to make the area Difficult Terrain. Creatures inside the living city who are not directly observing the shift must succeed on  a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the change. 
    If the living city creates a wall that cuts through another creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (the living city's choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its Reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</text>
    </action>
    <action>
      <name>Epic Resistance</name>
      <text>The living city chooses one condition, spell, or other effect currently affecting them and rolls 1d20. On an 11+, the effect ends on it. The living city can use this Epic Action even if it would otherwise be unable to take actions, its actions are being controlled by another creature, or if a spell or effect alters its game statistics.</text>
    </action>
    <description>An eerie light shines within the oddly intact yet ramshackle house across the road. The door hangs ajar, gently banging open and closed as the mist and winds whip through the dark streets. As you step inside the building, the lurching floorboards creak and groan. The furnishings are bizarrely orderly, and you notice nary a speck of dust or debris accumulated in the otherwise ordinary rooms. After a moment you notice a strange glistening liquid seeping out between the timbers, and the odd reddish goo that melts between the mortar of the bricks. Suddenly, the door slams shut, the windows close and shutter, and the entire room warps and shifts. Hundreds of yellow eyes open across the walls, grinning toothy mouths form on the ceilings and floors. Glistening barbed pseudopods reach up from the furniture, as you realize you have stepped right into the gullet of a patient predator.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Living City, learning the following based on their result:
(15+) Animated Building. You are aware of the Living City's Structural Form and No Exit traits, as well as its Immunities.
(20+) Escape Routes. You recognize that destroying the creature's walls and doors creates exits, but these are short- lived because of its Shifting Form Epic Action.
(25+) Slow, Smart, and Tough. You learn of the Living City's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
A Living City takes the form of an oddly intact residence, workshop, or warehouse using its Structural Form trait, and waits for hapless creatures to wander inside. A Living City may deceive characters into entering it using its telepathy and Haunting Whispers. It suppresses its Digestive Aura and so it can take full advantage of its False Appearance trait.
    Typically, a Living City shapes its body to create outer rooms that have walls bordering the edge of the Living City's space, and inner rooms deep within which do not have walls, ceilings, or floors immediately adjacent to spaces outside the Living City. The Living City will create doors, windows, or even stairs within it so that its prey can easily move from outside, to the outer rooms, and then further inside to the inner rooms. Often, the Living City might place any treasure or valuables it has collected in these inner rooms as bait.
    Once a few characters have entered one of its innermost rooms, the Living City attacks and activates its Digestive Aura. When it rolls Initiative, it uses its No Exit trait to close all the doors and windows in its body, trapping characters inside. Then, it attacks them with its Grasping Tendrils, Bite, and Haunting Whispers, while using its Shifting Form Epic Action to slowly change its interior, separating the characters and cutting off their escape routes. 
    Should the player characters break a hole in one of its walls, the Living City uses its Shifting Form trait to plug the hole. Note that some area-of-effect attacks and spells (such as Burning Hands) can damage or destroy multiple sections of the Living City. However, a Living City can only take damage from one section being destroyed per turn. If characters manage to slip outside the Living City through a breached hole or exit, the Living City may use its Grasping Tendrils to pull them back in. It then tries to quickly seal them inside again with Shifting Form.

    <description>The Haze enveloping you begins to churn and swirl, gradually coalescing into a dense mass of octarine fog. A ghostly visage emerges as a nebulous form takes shape, its features twisted in an eerie semblance of anguish. Flashes of contaminated energy crackle and spark inside the cloud, casting fleeting, sinister lights which mimic the movements of a tortured face. This roiling fog floats through the ruins, drifting like a specter haunted by its own turbulent essence.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Living Deep Haze, learning

(10+) Mundane Immunity. You are aware of the elemental's Immunities.
(15+) Animate Haze. You know of the creature's Fog Form and Deep Haze traits.
(20+) Fast but Dim-Witted. You understand its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
When it encounters an uncontaminated creature, the Living Deep Haze rapidly moves into its space thanks to its Fog Form trait. It then tries to remain there as much as possible so the creature is exposed to its Deep Haze trait. The Living Deep Haze wants to transform its targets into monsters, so it uses its Slam attacks to knock them Unconscious so they can awaken to a new existence as mutant horrors.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks to Study a Loathsome Gag Fly, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Flying Monstrosity. You know the Gag Fly's creature type and speeds.
(10+) Explosive Bile. You learn of the Gag Fly's Bloat Burst Reaction.
(15+) Bestial Minded. You recognize the Gag Fly's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Loathsome Gag Fly is a simple-minded creature who wants to feed on flesh and lay larva on the corpses of the dead. It sprays acid on any creature that it sees nearby in an attempt to weaken it. It then lands on them and begins feeding.
    Gag Flies usually attack in groups and care very little for the wellbeing of each other. As a matter of fact, when a Gag Fly is killed and explodes in a shower of acid, this usually causes other nearby flies to go into a feeding frenzy on targets sprayed in the gore, as they are drawn to any flesh dissolving in the acids of their mucus.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Animal Handling gain Advantage on Intelligence (nature) checks to Study a Lob Frog, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Poisonous Skin. You recognize the Lob Frog's Immunities and Poison Skin trait.
(10+) Hurled Eggs. You are aware of the Lob Frog's Throw Frogspawn action.
(15+) Assured Amphibian. You know the Lob Frog's Strength and Charisma ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Lob Frogs are keen to keep their distance from predators and threats, but are constantly on the lookout for hosts for their offspring. They attempt to lob their contaminated eggs at potential threats, hoping to produce more Lob Frogs. If confronted directly, their Poison Skin acts as a defense while they use their Standing Leap to escape unfavorable situations.
    If a Lob Frog has at least two or more targets with attached eggs, or if they are reduced below half Hit Points, they leap away to find somewhere safe and wet to hide. They would rather not risk their life, and simply hope to infect as many targets as possible to continue their species.

    <description>Elias Drexel is a man in his early fifties. He is stocky and imposing with a furrowed brow and a grim frown on his wide and angular face. His harsh features are framed with a thick moustache, side chops, and mane of long braided brown hair. He is garbed in chainmail armor with heavy leather gloves and boots, worn under a fur-lined dark green cloak and iron pauldrons. He wears a pinned brooch depicting the Seal of Drakkenheim, the symbol of his office as Lord Commander. A quiver, a longbow, and two longswords are strung on his back.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I have great responsibilities and have no time for senseless humor. I never cease to worry about our struggling militia's desperate task to reclaim these monster infested ruins. I have no patience for anything or anyone who doesn't further the Hooded Lanterns objectives.
• Ideal. Loyalty and trust are priceless. It must be carefully given, but staunchly held. There is nothing worse than betrayal and treason.
• Bond. During the Civil War, I switched sides and killed several scions of House von Kessel who could have claimed the throne. I once believed it was for the right cause, but now I feel personally responsible for breaking the royal line. My mission in Drakkenheim is penance and redemption.
• Flaw. I'm filled with rage and conflict because of my contradictory actions and beliefs, and I don't take defeat, setbacks, or even missteps lightly.

Combat Tactics.
Elias Drexel typically leads several Hooded Lantern Veterans into battle, using his Command action to grant them additional attacks while calling in artillery strikes as often as possible. Drexel himself operates as a skirmisher, switching between melee and ranged attacks to control the flow of battle.

    <description>This albino Garmyr stands well over 12 feet tall, covered in yellowish-white mangy fur, bloodstained and scarred from countless battles and clad in a patchwork armor of leather, chain, and bladed plate. Mummified heads hang from his belt. A mane of bony spines and tufts of barbed hair jut from his head and run down his back to a long white tail braided with skulls and bone fragments. A snarling visage sports long, jagged fangs and smoldering red eyes. The Lord of the Feast holds an oversized longbow, stringed with thick sinew. A quiver on his back holds enormous arrows. Some bristle with barbed snares, others are connected to coils of chains around the beast's wrists, while others are tipped with delerium shards.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine the Lord of the Feast learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Difficult to Kill. You know of the creature's Regeneration ability.
(10+) Dangerous Archer. You recognize that he carries special arrows revealing his Poison Arrow, Ensnaring Arrow, and Harpoon Arrow attacks.
(15+) Cunning Combatant. You learn their strongest and weakest saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Lord of the Feast stalks the Temple Ward of Drakkenheim with his war dogs, searching for glorious kills. He seeks out the most fearsome monsters, and loves picking fights with faction agents and adventurers. When a band of plucky heroes enters his territory, the Lord of the Feast tracks and hunts them until they leave the Inner City or he has their skulls.
    The Lord of the Feast uses a variety of arrows in combat: Poison Arrow to debilitate foes, Ensnaring Arrow to stop them fleeing, and Harpoon Arrow to pull them toward him to
engage in melee combat.
    If the Lord of the Feast is reduced below 100 Hit Points, he attempts to escape, but regroups as soon as possible with more hunters in tow to continue the hunt.

    <description>Lucretia Mathias is a willowy and wizened woman with piercing eyes and pursed lips. She is in her early nineties and keeps her graying black hair in a coiled bun beneath a linen shawl. Lucretia wears simple gray robes, and clutches a heavy leather-bound tome. A glowing golden crystal dangles from a silver chain around her neck. Her garb lightly conceals the delirium shard embedded in her heart.

It ripples with black voidlike hues and splashes of deep purples and blues as if its flesh was a moving image of the cosmos.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Lurker on the Threshold, learning the following based on the result.
(10+) Baleful Resistance. You know the creature's Immunities.
(15+) Arcane Beams. You learn the creature's Cosmic Rays attack action.
(20+) Enduring. You know the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
The Lurker on the Threshold is a creature of pure arcane energy and twisted realities. It fires Cosmic Rays at mortal creatures, warping their minds, showing truths that drive them mad, or undoes their very existence on a cellular level. It grabs creatures with its Tendrils and blasts its beams while holding them in place, undoing the creatures from the inside out, before tossing them aside and moving on to the next.
    The Lurker on the Threshold only flees if it is reduced to under half its Hit Points, not because of any sense of fear, but because it finds specific enemies a nuisance.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Insight gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study a Lurking Dreg, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Something's Off. You suspect this person may have been exposed to eldritch contamination.
(15+) Hiding Something. You are aware of the Lurking Dreg's Cunning Action trait.
(20+) Not A Humanoid. You realize this is a Dreg appearing to be a normal humanoid and recognize the Lurking Dreg's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Some Lurking Dregs hide in the shadows, waiting for an opportune moment to strike. Others pose as humans and attempt to converse with prey, hoping to draw them deeper into the ruins. Lurking Dregs have been known to use stories of lost allies, trapped children, and more to lure adventurers into an ambush.
    When they attack, Lurking Dregs use their Furious Ambush right away to get as many attacks in as possible. They Disengage if they can and attempt to keep their enemies at bay, possibly having other Dregs tie them up while the Lurking Dreg darts in and out.
    If Lurking Dregs find themselves outnumbered at any point, they run into the shadows and Hide, attempting to escape.

Combat Tactics
Magma Trolls hunt for food during the hottest days of summer or in places of extreme temperatures. Often accompanied by sweltering heat, they begin combat by unleashing their Sulfurous Belch before rushing in to maul foes with their claws and bites. 
    If a Magma Troll takes Cold damage, it immediately flees and attempts to find a safe place to recuperate.

Academy Combat Tactics
Broadly speaking, Amethyst Academy mages eschew combat, valuing their own lives too highly to take such risks. They view themselves as researchers, craftspeople, and scholars, not war mages—few bother learning damaging spells beyond simple cantrips, instead focusing on practical magic for their academic and industrial pursuits. Nevertheless, they know that magic is still a dangerous vocation, and ready themselves to flee perilous situations with Invisibility spells or teleportation magic.
    When violent confrontation seems inevitable, Amethyst Academy agents often hire mercenaries or adventurers, or dispatch summoned creatures in their stead. Nevertheless, there are bold explorers who take to field research and prepare themselves for dangerous expeditions—particularly, those who personally study the ruins of Drakkenheim. They often utilize constructs such as Shield Guardians or summoned elementals bound to service with Planar Binding. Mages usually begin combat with defensive or control spells as befits the situation, such as taking to the air with Fly or subduing foes with Slow. Only once they are certain the situation is under control will they use their signature Prismatic Blasts or area-of-effect spells like Fireball and Lightning Bolt. These mages almost always flee once they've become Bloodied, viewing a temporary setback or mission failure as a preferable outcome over their deaths.

A rat-like snout and eyes protrude from its rolling mass of pinkish flesh and patchy fur. It reaches for you with three long, gangly arms. Its midsection then opens with a yawning moan where a large purple tongue flops from between jagged teeth, slurping gobs of vile saliva as it drags itself towards its next meal.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Maw Vermin, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Filled with Delerium. You recognize that this creature gained the Magic Resistance trait, and has Resistance to Acid, Poison, and Necrotic damage.
(15+) Chew and Spit! You learn the details of the Maw Vermin's Bite, and Glob Launcher.
(20+) Dim but Enduring. You know the Maw Vermin's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
A Maw Vermin is a primal creature that cannot comprehend anything beyond its next meal. Ratlings give them a wide berth, as it is just as likely to consume them as anything else. When a Maw Vermin senses anything it can eat, it lumbers towards the meal, using its Grasping Maw to pull targets closer so it can Bite them. Maw Vermin want to consume anything in sight, using its own food to secure even more. It uses Glob Launcher to spit half-digested morsels, happily eating whatever mess is left over.

Minazorond recharges and immediately uses its Terrifying Roar.</text>
    </reaction>
    <description>The statue of a massive dragon sits coiled upon the tallest tower of Castle Drakken. Its cold demeanor shifts as the statue begins to tremble, waking from its slumber. Its cold eyes detect the slightest movement within the castle grounds. It stands, its wings unfurling, and cracks of octarine energy pulsing throughout its wicked form. As lightning forks behind it, illuminating its draconic form in all its majesty, it readies itself for the hunt.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or any kind of artisan's tools gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine Minazorond. They learn the following information based on their check result.
(10+) Resistant Form. You know the creature's Resistances and Immunities.
(15+) Shrug Off Effects. You recognize the creature's Draconic Rebuke ability.
(20+) Tough to Kill. You learn of its Construct Resilience trait. 

Combat Tactics
Minazorond is an animated engine of destruction charged with the protection of Castle Drakken. The corrupted protector attacks any who approach the palace itself, opening with a terrifying roar and a barrage of shocking bursts before closing the distance to unleash its breath weapon. Under most circumstances, the dragon is too large to physically enter the palace proper, and is thus restricted to attacking targets in the castle baileys and courtyards.

The leech can detach itself using 5 feet of movement, and detaches immediately if its memory bags are filled or if the target dies. 
    A creature within 5 feet can take an action to detach the leech with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

Failure: The target's Intelligence score is reduced by 1d4, and one of the leech's memory banks is filled. If this effect reduces the target's Intelligence score to 0, it has the Unconscious condition until it regains at least 1 point of Intelligence.

      <text>The leech can use this Bonus Action only when it is attached to a creature and has at least one filled memory bank. The attached creature gains Advantage on Intelligence-based D20 Tests for 1 minute, and the leech empties one of its filled memory banks.</text>
    </action>
    <description>The black, plump wriggling form of the leech squirms and crawls. Its oily, slick skin is wet and slippery. It lets out a high-pitched screech as it lunges towards its prey.

Alienists have long dabbled with the manipulation of the mind. They have little use in their experiments for removing or transfusing blood. However, through occult magic and dangerous experimentation, they have broken ground on the possibilities of extracting thoughts.
    The Mind Leech is an Alienist experiment wherein apothecaries have altered the genetics of their laboratory leeches into a Mind Leech. When placed on the back of a patient's neck, the Mind Leech sends tendrils into the spine and brainstem and pulls out the creature's psyche. This process has been used to both learn the patient's secrets and memories, as well as render them malleable to mind control, making perfect minions to Alienists.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a leech, learning the following based on the result: 
(10+) Quick Swimmers. You know the leech's Swim speed and senses.
(15+) Brain Eater. You are aware of the Mind Leech's Mind Leech's Brain Drain and Thought Infusion.

Combat Tactics
Leeches attempt to get close to a target to Bite and Attach to them. They do not retreat, as they are driven by their basic need to feed on the blood of others and nothing else.

    <description>The faith's missionaries are draped in white robes with leather belts and a sash hanging from their side adorned with the symbol of the Falling Fire. These devout missionaries lead pilgrims on their holy path to Drakkenheim, clutching the sacred writing of Lucretia Mathias in their hands.

Falling Fire Combat Tactics
Falling Fire pilgrims give up their possessions and wealth and often carry very little on them. For the most part, common Falling Fire devotees are not equipped to fight. Most members try to avoid combat. Preferring a peaceful approach, they are more reactionary in their tactics and hope most situations do not come to bloodshed. However, Drakkenheim is a dangerous city, and monsters and bandits have attempted to thwart the efforts of the devout worshippers often. Pilgrims have been known to take up clubs, daggers, and any mundane weapons they can find to defend themselves, and often groups of traveling pilgrims are accompanied by armored zealots and spellcasting divine leaders who are ready to protect their flock.

    <description>With thick glasses, a white lab coat, and some rather mundane garb, the Mutagenist is an unassuming figure. The most notable thing about them is the strange potion they carry in their hand: an elixir that bubbles with purple and orange hues, swirls of shimmering blues and greens flow within it. In some fleeting moments, you swear you see the liquid take forms of grotesque faces within the bottle.

Mutagenist Minions. The Mutagenist is constantly experimenting on other creatures before turning their concoctions onto themselves. First their tests involve small rodents, birds, or other unassuming livestock. Skinwings are one such example of a Mutagenist's early experimentation. When they move on to humanoid subjects, they create abominations like the Cerebrograft, while their failed experiments end up as Uncontained Growths.
    Every Mutagenist strives to accomplish the ultimate goal of the Apex Formula, the elixir that will transmogrify them into the perfect specimen of humanity, at least in their altered and maddened view.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I bury myself in books and research, and seldom talk to others.
• Bond. My work is important, with my research I could cure so many of humanity's inherent weaknesses, and make us stronger as a species.
• Ideal. Perfection is achievable if one just puts the time and effort into obtaining it.
• Flaw. I know my view of the perfect human is flawless, I will not hear otherwise

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Mutagenist, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Physiological Experts. You recognize the Mutagenist's saving throws, as well as the Grotesque Gargantuan's Resistances and Immunities.
(15+) Forced Mutation. You learn of its Mutant Strain and Transmogrifying Elixir action.
(20+) Hulking Form. You know of the Transmogrified Form's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Mutagenist relies on their spellcasting and Forced Mutation, attempting to cause debilitating effects on its foes while altering their forms.
    If the Mutagenist is in a losing situation, it drinks its Transmogrifying Elixir to become its Transmogrified Form. In this form, it hurls rocks at its targets, knocking them Prone. The hulking Mutagenist then bounds up to them and slams them with its Meaty Fists.

    <description>A simple looking man in his early thirties stands before you, one hand outstretched towards you in a gesture of friendly aid. He has curly brown hair, a warm calm upon his face, and wears dark gray robes and simple boots. Beneath his robes, the gentle octarine glow can be seen from his chest.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I speak in a warm and friendly tone, and often use metaphors of light and darkness to make my points. I want all who are in my presence to feel welcome and important.
• Ideal. Everyone deserves a real chance to see the light for themselves. No matter the darkness they carry, all darkness must flee in the presence of light once one lets it in.
• Bond. Lucretia Mathias has led these people to something incredible, and the more one speaks to her, and sees her power, the more obvious it is that she is a prophet, and she speaks a truth few can understand. I believe in her more than anyone else in this world and wish only to do right by her teachings.
• Flaw. I assume the best in people and am wilfully ignorant to the harm that could be done by trusting too easily.

Combat Tactics
Nathaniel is not a combatant, and rarely uses his divine powers to harm. However, if he must defend himself, or more likely, protect his pilgrims. Nathaniel uses Aid and Bless to bolster his allies, Spirit Guardians to protect himself, and use Fireballs if absolutely necessary to put down his foes.
    He will flee as soon as he can and help as many friends as possible do the same.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Religion or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when taking the Study action to examine a Night Blade, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Undead Resistance. You know the creature's Resistances.

(15+) Shadowy Retreat. You learn of the creature's Meld Into Shadow and Spectral Dodge features.

Combat Tactics
The Night Blade sticks to the shadows and darkness, attempting to surprise their foes and gain Advantage as often as possible. They attack their foes using their spectral weapons, using the Mindmuddler option against spellcasters. If the target is still alive by the 2nd round, the Night Blade takes the Disengage action to escape.
    The Night Blade flees if it is at a Disadvantage, is surrounded, or is in direct sunlight.

    <description>What at first appears to be a large pile of autumn leaves rises up and reveals a grotesque carved wooden face and gnarled oaken claws and feet. Its body is cloaked in a thick array of leaves all in hues of oranges, yellows, and reds. As it lurches forward it sounds like the autumn wind blowing through a lush forest, the sounds of its grunts and moans like creaking boughs of ancient trees, and its thumping footsteps like wooden branches hitting the forest floor.

    <description>Trudging through the thick overgrowth of Queen's Park Garden, you come across a massive tree with dark, nearly blackened bark, branches swaying and bobbing in the Haze-filled winds of the city. Unlike its barren and dying cousins nearby, its bright and flourishing foliage is alive. The ribs and veins of its thick purple leaves are shot through with pulsing octarine. Gently glowing upon its branches in small clusters are delerium crystals, sprouting from the tree like acorns. The whistling of the wind echoes through the delerium growths causing them to echo like eerie chimes. As you draw closer, the thick bough begins to shake and bend against the wind, and the tree's roots suddenly tear up from the soft earth. The massive shambling tree lurches up, and its darkened bark stretches and forms into a snarling grotesque face as it barrels towards you.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks to Study an Octarine Tree, learning the following based on their check result:
(5+) Resilient Sapling. You learn of the Octarine Tree's type, its Resistances, and Immunities.
(10+) Flying Fruit. You are aware of the creature's Delerium Fruit action.
(15+) Combustible Timber. You recognize the creature's vulnerability to fire.

Combat Tactics
The Octarine Tree grows in clusters within Queen's Park Garden, or in the forests north of Drakkenheim, but lone trees have been spotted in advantageous positions throughout the city. Whether in market squares or growing on cliff sides overlooking parts of the city, the trees seem to keep watch over large stretches of road. The Octarine Tree is surprisingly fast when it decides to move but usually opts to root itself in a good position and throw Delerium Fruit at its enemies.
    When engaged in melee, an Octarine Tree tangles up creatures in its Crushing Roots and Thwacks them. It will take an opportunity to lumber to a better position and plant itself in the ground to continue hurling fruit if it can.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Religion gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study an Oracle of the Rat God, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Divinely Resistant. You learn of the Oracle of the Rat God's Resistances and Immunities.
(15+) Fiendish Foresight. You recognize the oracle's Death Toll and Squeak of Doom actions, as well as its Tail Barbs Reaction.
(20+) Aware and Commanding. You know the Oracle of the Rat God's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
These revered figures are seldom encountered alone. Instead, they are often in the company of several Swarms of Ratlings and perhaps even borne aloft on a litter by a squadron of Giant Ratlings. They may even have several Warlocks of the Rat God serving them as underlings. These minions are disposable to the oracle, who commands their underlings to throw themselves against their foes with wild abandon.
    In battle, a ratling oracle fights from the back, calling out proclamations of doom on their foes using Death Toll and Squeak of Doom. They mock their foes' attempts at any success, attempting to use Tail Barbs to turn an opponent's luck against them.

    <description>A hunched and frail looking man stands before you, draped in a shadowy black cloak that covers most of his body, save for two hands wearing thick leather gloves, and a glimpse of a withered, pale face. His lidless eyes are open wide and yellow, with glints of octarine upon them. His lipless mouth reveals prominent yellowing teeth, and a sickly green tongue resembling a large fat worm darts in and out of his mouth as he speaks. His appearance is disturbing, like the thin skin holding him together is hanging off his sickly form. Looking closely, you start to realize several beetles, roaches, maggots, and other fat and fleshy insectoid creatures skittering along his cloak, out from his sleeves, across his neck, and trailing behind him as he moves. His raspy voice is stilted, and has a distinct sound of clicking, writhing things upon it.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study the Pale Man, learning the following based on their result:
(15+) Contaminated Monster. You know of his Creature Type, Resistances, and Immunities.
(20+) Master of Contaminated Magic. You learn of his Contaminating Touch and Abrupt Contaminant Epic Actions, and his Aura of Fleshy Insects.
(25+) Nearly Deathless. You are aware of his Crawling Flesh trait, as well as his weakest ability score and saving throw.

Combat Tactics
The Pale Man attempts to be polite and cordial to his guests. He tries to mask his terrible and cunning manner behind the guise of an academic interested in contamination, one who can aid the suffering. This is not untrue, as he helps those who come and are willing to pay for his services. But his experimentations are prone to mishaps. He delights in capturing contaminated creatures and attempting to bend their mutations to his will.
    If threatened, or if his true nature is discovered, the Pale Man tries to contaminate a creature, triggering terrible mutations and using magic to worsen their conditions.
    If reduced to 0 Hit Points, he explodes into a mass of bugs that crawls its way back to his cocoon, which is always nearby. He often keeps it in a secret location, one usually buried with only small cracks or holes leading to it. Perfect for a swarm of insects to get to, but difficult for anyone else.

    <description>This figure is draped in a heavy coat, with a bag full of tinctures, poisons, alchemical ingredients, and dried herbs. A gas mask and a drawn hood conceal their face. The Pathogenist draws a syringe filled with a glowing green formula as an acrid smell wafts from around them. They double check their pathogen, ensuring it is ready for their victims.

Pathogenist Minions. An Injector makes a great lab assistant for the Pathogenist, helping it administer disease and pathogens to its victims. Wretched Patients are often disease-ridden, bandaged individuals who are convinced that, if they aid the doctor, they will be cured. Plague Carriers are a common unfortunate product of a Pathogenist's experiments, used to deliver disease to its enemies in grotesque fashion.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I love my pathogens and viruses, and speak to my babies as if they were my children.
• Bond. Understanding the fine balance between what it takes to harm or heal is vital to the ongoing progression of modern medicine.
• Ideal. Disease is often feared and misunderstood, but with understanding, comes control. You do not need to fear that which you control.
• Flaw. I am bound to my work and cannot fathom the idea that I am misguided in my research.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine or Survival gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Pathogenist, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Poison Master. You learn of the Pathogenist's Resistances and Immunities as well as its Heightened Tolerance trait.
(15+) Disease Experimenter. You are aware of its Pestilent Infection and Outbreak actions.
(20+) Lacks Character. You know the Pathogenist's Strength and Charisma ability modifiers and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Pathogenist uses poison and disease to disable their foes. When combat begins, they attempt to inflict Plague of Wind upon a target, and proceed to use Outbreak to spread that disease. The Pathogenist uses Poison Needle to subdue problematic targets. The Pathogenist will attempt to flee if they have fewer than 40 Hit Points and are outnumbered.

(10+) Magic Eater. You understand its Consume Spell Reaction and Bite attack.
(15+) Stored Energy. You learn of the Phage's Spell Vessel trait.

Combat Tactics
Phages are compelled by their hunger for magic. They use their Consume Spell Reaction at the first opportunity, regardless of the spell being cast. 
    Unfed phages stalk their prey, harassing them with Bites but attacking nonlethally as a dead spellcaster cannot provide them with magical energy. Sated phages often become docile, only using Bite or Spit in defense, disengaging to escape if given the opportunity. When their lives are threatened, Phages digest stored spells to reposition in hopes of getting an even tastier morsel.

    <description>Dressed in plain gray robes tied off with a frayed rope, and wearing little else but a pair of old sandals, these pilgrims carry little on them and have given up their possessions for a simple life dedicated to the Falling Fire.

Combat Tactics
Untrained and unprepared for combat, most pilgrims can only operate as a mob, using their numbers to overwhelm threats. Faith strengthens their resolve, and their morale holds fast whilst their leaders spurn them to holy purpose.

Falling Fire Combat Tactics
Falling Fire pilgrims give up their possessions and wealth and often carry very little on them. For the most part, common Falling Fire devotees are not equipped to fight. Most members try to avoid combat. Preferring a peaceful approach, they are more reactionary in their tactics and hope most situations do not come to bloodshed. However, Drakkenheim is a dangerous city, and monsters and bandits have attempted to thwart the efforts of the devout worshippers often. Pilgrims have been known to take up clubs, daggers, and any mundane weapons they can find to defend themselves, and often groups of traveling pilgrims are accompanied by armored zealots and spellcasting divine leaders who are ready to protect their flock.

    <description>A mass of flesh and tissue quivers and wobbles. Its multiple appendages include outstretched humanoid arms, wriggling tentacles, gangly limbs with talons, and clasping claws. The creature pulls itself forward, squealing and whining from multiple deformed mouths. Numerous multi-colored eyes in misplaced arrangements move and shift across the form. Tumors bulge and shrink within its mass. As the creature spots you, a chaotic chorus of cries cascades out of its chomping mouths.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study a Protean Abomination, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Corpse Eater. You know of its Absorption trait.
(15+) Enveloping Mass. You uncover the Protean Abomination's Engulf feature.
(20+) Weak Minded. You recognize the abomination's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Protean Abomination is a hungry creature that hides in dark ruins, old basements, or in piles of rubble, squeezing out to devour anything that comes by. No longer capable of strategic or nuanced thought, the Protean Abomination simply wishes to feed, grow, and survive. It is very territorial and once it has chosen a place to nest, it will stay there for months or years, only moving if it has gone weeks without absorbing a creature.
    When prey does wander by, Protean Abominations will attempt to move up to the creature and Engulf it. It wants only to absorb the creature into its mass and grow stronger.
    If brought below half Hit Points, the abomination might try to squeeze into a location where it cannot be followed to escape, waiting patiently for less problematic prey.

    <description>It begins in the eyes. A glistening veneer of tears that coagulate against the surface of the eye and begins to ooze. The white sclera dribbles in gelatinous rivulets down sagging cheeks. Its flesh is mottled. Browns, tans, greens, and purples color the unseemly visage. One side of the face twists downward in a cruel sneer, the other side, expressionless. Slack jawed, the mouth opens into a gaping expanse. Its quiet weeping turns into pleas for its life, frenetic cries, a cacophony of voices. The chorus of agony rises to a crescendo, culminating with an ear-splitting scream as its arms reach for you.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Insight or Investigation gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to study a Psychophant, revealing the following based on their result:
(5+) Feeding on Despair. You are aware of its Life Siphon ability.
(10+) Resistant Form. You know its Resistances and Immunities.
(15+) Escape with Prey. You learn of the creature's Teleport Bonus Action.

Combat Tactics
A Psychophant feeds on the weak and will avoid a fight with competent adventurers unless the right opportunity presents itself, or its true nature is discovered. In combat it will attempt to subdue aggressors with its Final Scream, then target the bloodiest opponent with its Psychic Grasp. Victim in hand, it will attempt to flee using Teleportation, repeatedly feeding on the target with its Life Siphon until the creature falls unconscious.

    <description>This horror is an amorphous mass of limbs, hands, mouths, and eyes. Among the disturbing mess are hands with eyes embedded in the palms that have mouths for pupils, fingers that end in hands with fingers that end in hands, eyes within eyes within mouths with wriggling fingertips for teeth, lips for eyelids, and grasping hands for tongues. Some of the many-colored eyes dart about in panic while others droop lazily as if falling in and out of sleep. Some of the mouths talk, citing obscure languages and bits of poetry, while the countless hands gesticulate frantically.

Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Pyknic Maunder, learning the following based on their result:

(10+) Mind Numbing. You recognize the creature's Bite and Babble actions.
(15+) Practically Mindless. You are aware of its strongest and weakest saving throws.

Combat Tactics
A maunder has no sense for combat tactics and exists only to eat whatever it can get within the grasp of its many hands. Once it has hold of a creature, it immediately begins to feed using its Bite. A Pyknic Maunder will attack an unconscious or downed character, uncaring about other attackers.

    <description>The Queen of Thieves is a scheming mastermind who controls Drakkenheim's underworld. She transformed hundreds of squabbling outlaws into a criminal empire. However, none know her true identity. She is most infamously encountered as a lithe masked woman in swashbuckling attire with a wide-brimmed hat and jeweled rapier. However, she may radically change her appearance, as her mood and circumstances dictate. She typically confirms her identity by revealing a secret or by demonstrating her uncanny ability to alter her appearance.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. "I am never unprepared and have multitudes of contingencies. I casually expose secrets with rakish confidence, and flaunt my ability to be anybody or anywhere."
• Ideal. "I relish mind games and manipulating people. In- stead of spilling blood, I spill secrets. My enemies are worthless as corpses. When I steal lives, I spend them dearly first."
• Bond. "Law is powerless in the chaos of the ruins. As long as anarchy reigns, so shall I."
• Flaw. "Anyone who trusts me is a terrible fool. Double-crossing is my nature. I expect everyone to betray me, and I'll relish the opportunity to defeat them when they do."

Few of the Queen's Men have met her, and even less have been in the Court of Thieves. Most only know that, if you get a Queen of Diamonds card with a note attached, you better do what it says.

Combat Tactics
The Queen of Thieves never fights a battle personally unless she knows she's going to win. If you're running her in combat, she should attempt to escape unless you are utterly certain she will defeat your player characters. She does not slay the player characters but should allow them to flee or take them captive. Either way, she mocks them mercilessly for trying to defeat her.
    When the Queen of Thieves needs to escape, she uses her Dash and Misdirection Epic Actions, before using Greater Invisibility, Dimension Door, or Gaseous Form to slip away.

    <description>The massive floating figure resembles a large vermin with a thousand tails spanning out from behind it, shaped into six massive wings. Its large protruding belly is filled with a hundred small rat faces chattering, gnashing, and screaming. Its four elongated arms each end in eight vermin fingers and it holds two of its hands before it in a symbolic form of a rat head. The other two arms are held off to the side, each clutching a rusted chain; one chain ends in a censer gently glowing with purple flames and wafting incense, the other ends in a flail of bloodied rat skulls. Its head is composed of three vermin faces with glowing purple eyes and a large central eye upon an elongated forehead. Floating above it is a halo of jagged rotating blades that drips blood down upon its head, seeping and running down its body, pouring into oblivion below. It speaks in a chorus of endless rasping voices, echoing and reverberating in pitches and tones that form words out of an auditory mosaic of scurrying rat swarms and gnawing little teeth.

Roleplaying Traits
The Rat God has destructive and apocalyptic motivations.
• Personality Traits. You seem hungry. Are you hungry?
• Ideal. Eat or be eaten. That is the way of things. Eat! Eat! Eat! It is all food when you need to survive!
• Bond. What you have is not enough. If you kill and eat them all. What was theirs is now yours!
• Flaw. Why does your friend get to have nicer things than you? Don't you deserve them instead? Betray them! Eat them! Make it yours!

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when they take the Study action to examine the Rat God, learning the following based on the result:
(20+) Fiendish Power. You are aware of its Truesight and telepathy, its Resistances and Immunities, and its Epic Resistance. You also know this Rat God is beyond life and death and can reform years later if killed
(25+) Cloud of Rats. You are aware of the creature's Verminous Aura trait.
(30+) Powerful Presence. You know Rat God's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Rat God is a being of pure malice and appetite. It cares not for the whims of mortals, only for pure destruction and the chattering and gnawing of infinite rats as they devour the cosmos. It finds joy only in annihilation, and the screams of mortals as they are reduced to bone by the Rat God's writhing swarm.
    The Rat God can use its Rodent Rift to move to where it can catch as many targets as possible in its Verminous Aura, then set them ablaze with its Flail of Skulls. It will target the weakest characters with its Warp Bolt, and the least intelligent with its Infernal Chittering. It performs a Great Feeding to replenish itself and uses Rodent Rifts to escape a dangerous situation.

    <description>This ratling stands head-and-shoulders over the others and has black-brown fur and a wicked grin; some of his frontmost teeth are delerium crystals. He wears scavenged bits of light armor, tattered dark blue rags, and a gold crown, which is slightly too small for his head.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality. The Rat Prince bullies the others like a despot. When speaking, the Rat Prince repeats words two or three times for emphasis. "Yes, yes, yes…"
• Ideal. The Rat Prince loves killing, eating, breeding, and sleeping. Pretty much in that order.
• Bond. The Rat Prince wears a makeshift crown and claims he's the ruler of all the ratlings in Drakkenheim. This is far from true, but good luck convincing the Rat Prince otherwise.
• Flaws. Logic makes the Rat Prince confused and angry, unless that logic involves food. The Rat Prince holds the Rat God in equal fear and awe. He is very superstitious about necromancy, illusions, and enchantment magic. He is afraid of ghosts but loves fire.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Insight gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study the Rat Prince, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Fearsome Leader. You know he has the traits of a typical ratling, though he is much more formidable.
(10+) Delerium Teeth. You recognize the Rat Prince's Contaminated Bite attack.
(15+) Adverse to Logic. You are aware of the Rat Prince's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws, as well as the flaws noted in the Rat Prince's roleplaying traits.

Combat Tactics
Leading other ratlings into battle, the Rat Prince is a ferocious combatant. He uses his Sacrificial Pawn Reaction to avoid attacks while firing his crossbow or attacking ferociously with his Contaminated Bite. He uses Ratling Cunning to ensure that he remains adjacent to another ratling he can use as a body shield.
    Caught alone, the Rat Prince doesn't fight: he flees. If he can't, he cries and begs for his life. He will sell out other ratlings if it means his own survival. When this rat is cornered, he offers anything he can think of to convince characters to let him go free, and will claim he can lead characters to fantastic treasures, secret passages through the city, vast amounts of "the shiny," and boasts that his favorable reputation amongst the ratlings can guarantee safety. Whether or not these are true is up to you. Unless the characters can make the Rat Prince loyal in some other way (through food, fear, or magic), he tries to escape at the earliest opportunity.

Its flesh is covered in sores, blisters, and infected wounds. It rummages through its bag before producing a vial and tossing it forcefully to the ground at your feet.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Medicine gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Ratling Pathogenist, learning the following based on the result:

(10+) Infectious You are aware of its Plaguebringer Aura and Infection action.
(15+) Nimble but Weak. You recognize the ratling's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Ratling Pathogenist is a cunning killer and loves to riddle its foes with diseases. The ratling will release one of its deadly infections into a creature nearby and use Rampant Sickness to spread it to anyone nearby. Metastasis causes the disease to kill its target even faster.
    The pathogenist prefers to keep their distance and will attempt to scurry away if cornered or forced to fight in melee. It will also run if it is alone, or if its allies are fewer than its enemies.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Ratling Warrior, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Mutated Monstrosities. You are aware these creatures have an excellent sense of smell, Darkvision, are capable climbers and swimmers, and are Immune to Contamination.
(10+) Mob Attacks. You learn of the Ratling Warrior's Pack Tactics trait and Ratling Cunning action.
(15+) Swift, Weak, and Cowardly. You know its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Ratlings fight together in large groups to surround and overwhelm their foes with Pack Tactics. They use whatever rusty weapons they can find, or use their teeth and claws when nothing else is available. Occasionally, ratlings carry makeshift slings and hurl anything they pick up off the ground at their enemies: rocks, bones, or even chips of delerium.
    However, ratlings flee and hide using Ratling Cunning when they don't have a numerical advantage over their foes. Indeed, they won't start fights if they don't outnumber their foes at least two to one, but while they outnumber their foes three to one or more, the typical ratling warrior can become insanely brave. When ratlings overpower their foes, they may even grapple them down and take them as prisoners to eat later.

    <description>This massive plant writhes forward on a mass of roots and vines. Its large leaves waving back and forth surround its great floral head.

The creature looks ready to swallow you whole.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Ravenous Flora, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Plant-like nature. You understand the Ravenous Flora's Immunities and its Poison Ivy trait.
(15+) Giant Maw with Toxic Pollen. You learn of its Writhing Aura and Swallow.
(20+) Large and Slow. You recognize its movement speed and Dexterity saving throw.

Combat Tactics
The Ravenous Flora attempts to hypnotize its prey with its Hypnotic Pollen. Because it is a slow-moving creature, it uses this to attract victims before attempting to Bite and Swallow its targets. If no targets are in range, it Spits Acid at them and does its best to move to an advantageous position.

Its gaze turns in your direction.

Thick poison drips from the grimy teeth and claws of these feral, unarmored ghouls. Their sunken, stark white eyes glisten as they lick their lips with a long, slimy pointed tongue, hungry for their next meal.

Study The Foe
Characters proficient in Religion or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when taking the Study action to examine a Ghoul, learning the following based on the result.
(5+) Undead Resistance. You recognize the creature's Immunities.
(10+) Pursuing Hunger. You know the creature's melee attacks and its Bonus Actions.
(15+) Agile Attacker. You are aware of its highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
Ghouls are mindless and vicious. They charge towards enemies with an insatiable hunger for human flesh, and rarely flee from a fight. They can be easily distracted by a fresh corpse to eat, and follow the whims of their masters. The hungrier the ghoul is, the less mindful it is, and the more aggressive it becomes.
    Some vampires are known to starve their ghouls for months before unleashing them into battle. Although these ravenous ghouls are less coherent, their complete frenzied hunger makes them a much more dangerous threat.
    Ghoul priests and Ghoul Lords often accompany larger arrangements of ghouls to help focus them towards their vampire master's enemies. The priests keep them fighting through mortal wounds while Ghoul Lords lead the charge into combat.

These cysts are a cancer growing within Drakkenheim. The very air around the cyst changes, the light refracts in incorrect patterns, and the lines and angles of its surroundings seem to fracture in incoherent designs. To look upon it is like looking at reality itself through a broken mirror. One that is both present and not present at all, where your every move and step are strained and confused. For a brief moment, you seem to forget what you saw at all, and the landscape around you seems unfamiliar. Have you been here before? How did you get here in the first place? Your mind strains to grasp these questions.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana gain Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks to Study a Reality Cyst, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Unmoving Aberration. You learn the Reality Cyst's creature type and speed.
(10+) Draining Rejuvenation. You are aware of the creature's Feed Bonus Action.
(15+) Anomalous Influence. You recognize the cyst's ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Reality Cyst is less of a hunter than it is a disease. It feeds off the confusion of creatures trapped in its illusions. It mimics the bending realities of the Space Between Worlds and mirrors that into the minds of those who are close to it. After their target enters a trance, it drinks their mental energy and grows.
    The Reality Cyst does only one thing: it feeds. It cannot move or defend itself well against attacks. It relies on creatures succumbing to its Unhinged Reality trait and devouring their minds. Once discovered, there is little the cyst can do to survive.

    <description>Charging towards you with unbound fury is a lithe human clad in a hulking suit of full plate wielding a pair of oversized scimitars. As they draw closer with a snarl, it becomes clear you face no mere warrior, but a monstrous abomination of metal and flesh. The emaciated figure is not wearing the armor: the plates have been riveted and bolted into their bones. Globs of weeping, infected scar tissue pulsate where the body fights against the metal fused into muscle and sinew. It does not hold its weapons: its forelimbs have been entirely replaced with scything talon-blades. Their metal helmets are smooth and featureless save for a single ocular delerium lens, and expose the creature's sickly mouth and sharpened teeth, its breath giving off a rank chemical odor.

Constructs of Metal and Flesh. Despite their outward appearances, Reautomata are constructs, not undead: their organic components operate more like machines than mere flesh. Such is the composition of a Reautomata that they fight on despite grievous injury, unflinching even as they are dismembered. Stopping a Reautomata necessitates mangling its body past the point of physical operation. Reautomata are ultimately brutal and decisive combatants that fight without regard for their personal well-being.

Created in Torment. Reautomata must be skilfully made by a master Reanimator using the finest components. It is essential the work begins on both a living and fully conscious individual. Typically, most apothecaries perform the work without anesthetic, instead opting to sever the vocal cords of their victims so as to not have their screams disturb the grim work involved. Limbs are removed and replaced, and metal is grafted into flesh and welded into the bone of the fully aware subject. Nervous tissue is pulled from the brain and distributed from the body, giving the construct nearly perfect proprioceptive awareness while excising unnecessary or superfluous brain tissues associated with cognitive functions. The process renders the Reautomata fully obedient, but not mindless.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Reautomata. Each successful check reveals one of the following pieces of information:
(16+) Dispassionate Metal and Flesh. You are aware of the Reautomata's Relentless Endurance trait, as well as its damage and condition Immunities.
(19+) Limb Weapons. You know of the Reautomata's Arm Blades and Entrapping Rend attacks.
(21+) Focused Killer. You learn the Reautomata's Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Reautomata fight with outward ferocity and aggressive attacks which belie the cold, unfeeling calculation at the core of each soldier. In battle, Reautomata launch themselves towards their foes in great leaps, impaling their targets upon their rending arm blades. The rending blades flense into flesh and latch on like hooks, allowing the Reautomata to restrain their targets. They then use their great strength to rend apart their restrained victims.
    Reautomata unquestionably obey the orders of their creator and will fight until destroyed without regard for their own bodies. However, even with only general instructions, Reautomata fight intelligently and know how to utilize the environment to their advantage, making use of their climb speeds and jumping ability to prioritize dangerous targets.

Failure by 5 or More: The Charmed condition lasts 24 hours or until Vladimir von Drakken is reduced to 0 Hit Points.

    While in bat or mist form, Vladimir von Drakken can't speak. His game statistics, other than his size and Speed, are unchanged, but he can't use Epic Actions other than Shape-Shift and Epic Resistance. While in mist form, Vladimir von Drakken can't speak or manipulate objects, and loses his Aura of Dread. He is weightless and can enter an enemy's space and stop there.

    <description>"None without this blood within may strike you down, and by this blood you shall not die."
— Prophecy uttered during the Sanguine Rite

Vladimir von Drakken stands awash in mighty power. Standing nearly seven feet tall, he is armored head to toe in ornamented and blood-drenched plate mail. The breastplate bears the ancient sigil of House von Drakken. Draconic wings unfurl from his back, the membranes colored a deep red like a dying star. His snarling face has the chiseled features of a calculating predator. He growls, bearing his long, sharp fangs which dribble fresh blood around his perfectly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard. In a single hand, he holds a vicious greatsword, which he points towards you, issuing a mortal challenge.

This is Vladimir von Drakken's normal form, once he has regained his full strength. In this form, he is a cunning and strategic adversary.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. Vladimir speaks with vile overconfidence, a sinister smirk, and a demeanor of a creature who believes himself a god, he does not tolerate others treating him as any less than a king of kings.
• Bond. Vladimir will stop at nothing to conquer the continent and reclaim his throne in Drakkenheim. He made it, and it is his to rule, any other who attempts to sit upon it is an imposter.
• Ideal. "This realm belongs to the dead, and the dead shall keep it. Any who stand in the way of my reign will join my legions by choice, or by force."
• Flaw. Vladimir believes himself entirely indestructible and is blind to the loopholes within the rites that created him. Nevertheless, he is hesitant to trust anyone. He refuses to let anyone get close and assumes everyone is plotting against him.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Religion gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when taking the Study action to examine Vladimir von Drakken, learning the following based on the result:
(15+) Deadly Foe. You know of the creature's Resistances and Immunities.
(20+) Renowned Swordsman. You are aware of his Bloodmourne and Bite attacks.
(25+) Nearly Undefeatable. You recognize his Reborn or Ascendent Transformation trait.

Combat Tactics
Vladimir von Drakken is presented here in three forms. As the Ascendent Vampire grows in power he transforms into a new form until he returns to his full strength.
    If he is successfully resurrected with the Sanguine Rite, Vladimir von Drakken first begins in his Crypt-Starved form. He remains in this form until he consumes the blood of a living descendant of House von Drakken, which enables him to turn into his Reborn form.
    If reduced to 0 Hit Points in his Reborn form, Vladimir von Drakken unleashes his Ascendant form.
    In his Crypt-Starved form, Vladimir von Drakken is a craven and desperate combatant. He primarily aims to drink as much blood as possible using his Bite to transform into his Reborn form. He makes use of Shadow Step and Terrifying Glare to reposition himself and hold foes at bay.
    Once he regains his Reborn form, Vladimir von Drakken is nearly unstoppable. He wades into melee with Bloodmourne, demonstrating his martial superiority by using his manoeuvres. He uses his Claws and Bite as finishing moves and uses Dominate to bend his foes to his will. When surrounded, he uses Wing Blast to reposition.
    Assuming his Ascendant form, Vladimir von Drakken becomes an engine of bloodlust and destruction, fueled by primal rage and undead power. In this form, he rips foes apart with melee attacks and flays their spirits whenever his Soul Rend becomes available.

Slaying Vladimir von Drakken
Vladimir cannot be fully destroyed unless he is wholly unmade at the place he was first transformed. Wholly destroying Vladimir von Drakken is difficult. Once he is defeated in combat, with the final blow struck by one who shares his blood, his heart must be cut out, and placed upon the altar within the Standing Stones in in the Brachenwald where he was transformed into a vampire.Under a full moon at midnight, a wooden stake made from a branch from Elenthas the Evertree must be driven through the heart by one of his blood descendants. Then, the heart must be left there until sunrise where it is destroyed by first light. Vladimir von Drakken's minions do not stand idly whilst this happens, and launch a massive assault upon the grove with the desperate aim of retrieving his heart before it is destroyed by the sun.

    <description>This massive creature is made up of mutated, stitched-together body parts. The process of joining parts and intentional mutations has rendered the former patient into a mindless beast, nearly swallowed by its own growths. Its oversized arms carry a great whirling bone saw that spins and whirs as it lumbers forward, spraying gore and soaking its aprons in blood, bone, and grey matter. They wear a blood-soaked medical apron and mask.

Parts Collectors. Apothecaries stitch all manner of extra arms, hands, and limbs to their Rippers, which the creature uses to gather severed body parts and hold down subjects.

Fear Engine. The Ripper's tortured mind sympathetically responds when it senses a victim's fear and terror, but its twisted brain responds with adrenaline and bloodlust.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Ripper, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Occult Science Construct. You know of its Insensitive to Pain trait, as well as its damage and condition Immunities.
(15+) Razor-Sharp Weapons. You recognize the Ripper's Whirling Bonesaw attack, and its Feed on Fear and Dismemberment traits.
(20+) Formidable but Dim-Witted. You learn the Ripper's Constitution, Dexterity, and Intelligence saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Ripper is an unsubtle and unsophisticated combatant, but it can follow its creators' orders intelligently. Unless directed otherwise, a Ripper usually begins battle by using its Gory Display to terrify its victims. It then ponderously moves towards its chosen target before lowering its Saw Blade down, preferring Frightened targets to benefit from its Feed on Fear trait. During its turn, a Ripper continues attacking with its Saw Blade until it misses. If it reduces a target to 0 Hit Points, it does not stop making attacks until its target dies.

    <description>River is a short tiefling woman in her late twenties. Her attire is practical and professional: a hip-length purple jacket with a high collar. Belted at her waist are several pouches and pockets. She wears five rings on her right hand. Two oddly-shaped dark brown horns sprout backwards from her flowing blue hair, creating the impression of two boats at sea. River has spotted brown skin and impish features: her teeth are too sharp, her tongue too long, and it's slightly unsettling when she smiles.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. I converse using precise academic terminology, but amongst those I trust as competent and capable, I inject a wry and sardonic sense of humor.
• Ideal. I like people who are professional, deliver results, and don't ask questions. I cannot stand fools who waste my time with buffoonery, haggling, and excuses.
• Bond. Eldrick Runeweaver is my mentor, teacher, and friend. I've worked alongside him for years, and any success he has will be mine as well.
• Flaw. I grew up surrounded by the magical amenities of the Amethyst Academy, so I don't understand what life is like for those who had a more mundane upbringing.

Combat Tactics
River is not a combatant and never initiates violence. If she is attacked or finds herself in the midst of conflict, her sole objective is survival. Her first action is always to cast either Dimension Door or Invisibility and flee. She won't take risks with her own life, even to fulfil a critical objective for the Amethyst Academy or save someone she cares about. However, she will take the opportunity to help another ally escape by using Invisibility on them or bringing them with her when she teleports.

Combat Tactics
The Royal Assassins have a selection of potent poisons applied to their weaponry. They carefully prepare and select each dose for their intended targets. They use Silent Scream against spell- casters or when absolute quiet is needed, Sap Strength against warriors likely to put up stiff resistance of their own, and Sluggish Sinews against agile targets who may try to escape.

Queen's Men Combat Tactics
Amongst the Queen's Men, different groups may be organized as infiltrators, thieves, saboteurs, and assassins, who work unseen until the moment they strike. In contrast, highway robbers and enforcers operate openly, trying to shakedown and intimidate their marks to give up any valuables without a fight. Regardless, members of the Queen's Men are seldom willing to stick around when a fight starts going against them, valuing their own lives first and foremost.

Falling Fire Combat Tactics
Falling Fire pilgrims give up their possessions and wealth and often carry very little on them. For the most part, common Falling Fire devotees are not equipped to fight. Most members try to avoid combat. Preferring a peaceful approach, they are more reactionary in their tactics and hope most situations do not come to bloodshed. However, Drakkenheim is a dangerous city, and monsters and bandits have attempted to thwart the efforts of the devout worshippers often. Pilgrims have been known to take up clubs, daggers, and any mundane weapons they can find to defend themselves, and often groups of traveling pilgrims are accompanied by armored zealots and spellcasting divine leaders who are ready to protect their flock.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Religion or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when taking the Study action to examine a Sanguine Witch, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Unnatural Resistances. You recognize the creature's damage Resistances and Immunities.
(10+) Siphon Vitality. You learn of the creature's Feast action.
(15+) Arcane Caster. You know the creature possesses formidable spellcasting abilities.

Combat Tactics
The Sanguine Witch uses Darkness to hide themselves and attempt to enthrall subjects with Hold Person before using Feast to feed on them. The witch's goal is to create thralls of their opponents.
    If the Sanguine Witch is in direct sunlight, or at less than half their Hit Points, they attempt to flee.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Sentient Planetoid, learning the following based on the result.
(10+) Mental Fortress. You are aware of the creature's Resistances and Immunities. 
(15+) Panoptic Arcanist. You learn of the creature's AllKnowing Magic action. 
(20+) Unfathomable Strength. You know the creature's highest and lowest ability scores. 

Combat Tactics
Sentient Planetoids are not all hostile creatures. Some of them, who have knowledge of mortals, deem them a pest or a problem, especially if traversing the Space Between Worlds. Like a mortal who finds a rat in their home, a sentient planetoid will attempt to remove the creature or kill it.
    Some planetoids might wish to converse with mortals, wanting to learn information from them about simple concepts of mundane life, or ask questions they think a mortal would know, only to confuse them with esoteric concepts and broad ideas of the universe. This can sometimes frustrate a planetoid who may react by simply wanting to eradicate the creature who bothered it.

    <description>The murky sewer waters churn as something below the surface stirs. A mass of debris, algae, and waste slowly rises from the water, and a sloping mass of sewage emerges with a gurgling hiss. Before you, a great shambling form launches towards you, grasping with its writhing tendrils, moving through sewage with surprising speed.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival gains Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks to Study a Sewer Thing, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Resilient Plant. You know it's creature type, Resistances, and Immunities
(10+) Poisonous Engulfer. You learn of the creature's Poison Absorption and Engulf features.
(15+) Sense of Self. You understand the creature's Wisdom and Charisma ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Sewer Thing waits for the opportune moment to strike. It lets creatures approach, appearing as plant matter over some sewer debris. Once its prey is close, it springs to life, lashing out with its tendrils at any it has surprised, attempting to Engulf them. This tactic works well if it is in water or sewage, where it can pull victims beneath the surface.
    The Sewer Thing starts combat attempting to Engulf surprised targets. Once a creature is Engulfed, the Sewer Thing retreats into the sewer water and flees. It is a hunter, consuming its prey by dissolving them inside of it. Once it has its food, it has no reason to stay and fight.

    <description>Swooping above on thick leathery wings is a large lion-like predator with a disturbingly human head contorted into an expression of fury. Its body bristles in a thicket of crystalline quills that painfully jut out
through its mane, along its wing-tips, and down its spine. It has a long, chitinous tail ending in a cluster of wicked stingers. Each begins as a spike of blackened bone but ends as a glittering delerium shard.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Shardmaul Manticore, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Mutated Manticore. You're aware the creature has no special Resistances or Immunities but is a capable flier.
(15+) Death From Above. You recognize the manticore's Stinger and Wing Shards attacks.
(25+) Strong, Fast, and Tough. You learn the manticore's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Shardmaul Manticore attacks from above, choosing whichever target looks weakest and the least armored. It descends from above suddenly, making Bite and Claw attacks against the weakest prey it detects. After its first descent, it lifts off again, using Wing Shards to cover its ascent. It then repeats its attack pattern.
    A Shardmaul Manticore is bold enough to attack when outnumbered but typically flees if it faces stiff opposition that reduces it to half its Hit Points or fewer.

Harvestable Components (Rare)
Animus: Monstrosity. Fluid: Monster Blood, Contaminated Ichor. Organs: Eyes, Heart, Brain, Guts, Flesh. Bones: Skull, Spine, Ribs. Natural Weapons: Teeth, Claws, Needles. Hair: Fur. Hide: Skin, Webbed Membrane.

Delerium: The quills on its body are made of delerium and may be harvestable: 1d6 – 2 delerium fragments can be collected from its quills (minimum 0).

    <description>Garbed in heavy armor with blue capes lined in silver trim, embroidered with the symbol of the Silver Order, the paladin's helmet has a large blue plume. A quiver of javelins rests upon their back.

Combat Tactics
What the Silver Order lacks in subtlety they make up for with sheer force. They are a military organization, and their soldiers are well trained and work together as a team. When they tackle problems, they do so in a uniform fashion, knowing when to
rely on one another, complete tasks and make pushes in unison. The Silver Order has simple call signs, hand signals, commands, and strategies that they can rely on in the field.
    Silver Order knights and paladins should work as a cohesive unit who know their strengths and how to protect their weaknesses.
    Any Silver Order regiment is accompanied by at least one paladin or Flamekeeper, and usually at least one of each. Larger organized military missions will see griffon riders as well as entire units of paladins and several Flamekeepers or Pyre Priests. This means that no Silver Order unit is without moderate healing, protective buffs, and often forms of divination and holy battle magic. When push comes to shove, the order's divine spellcasters tend to have a few Fireballs and Flamestrikes amongst their options.

    <description>These simple foot soldiers make up the bulk of the ground troops for the Silver Order. Fitted with decent armor and shields, a longsword, and the emblems of the Silver Order, they are the first lines of defense against otherworldly monsters and magical threats.

Combat Tactics
What the Silver Order lacks in subtlety they make up for with sheer force. They are a military organization, and their soldiers are well trained and work together as a team. When they tackle problems, they do so in a uniform fashion, knowing when to
rely on one another, complete tasks and make pushes in unison. The Silver Order has simple call signs, hand signals, commands, and strategies that they can rely on in the field.
    Silver Order knights and paladins should work as a cohesive unit who know their strengths and how to protect their weaknesses.
    Any Silver Order regiment is accompanied by at least one paladin or Flamekeeper, and usually at least one of each. Larger organized military missions will see griffon riders as well as entire units of paladins and several Flamekeepers or Pyre Priests. This means that no Silver Order unit is without moderate healing, protective buffs, and often forms of divination and holy battle magic. When push comes to shove, the order's divine spellcasters tend to have a few Fireballs and Flamestrikes amongst their options.

Soft blue light glows in the eye sockets of this skeleton, who carries a bow made from bone and ancient sinew. Shards of frost form on its arrow tip as it takes aim.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Religion or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when taking the Study action to examine a skeleton, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Unnatural Resistances. You recognize the creature's Immunities.
(10+) Deathly Violence. You know the creature's basic attacks and Bonus Actions.
(15+) Unliving Abilities. You learn the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
These skeleton warriors are mindless foot soldiers in the wars of vampires. They march into battle with no care. They feel no pain. They only follow their orders and fight to the death on behalf of their vampiric masters.

    <description>Out of the shadows you hear a sloping and squishing sound like someone dragging raw meat across the ground. The first thing you see are two arms reaching out from the darkness, the flesh sagging and drooping. The hands grasp the ground and slowly pull the creature forward revealing a squished pile of flesh resembling a human body without bones, organs, or muscle: simply a bag of skin that drags itself across the ground. Its empty eye holes and open mouth hang agape from its flopped over head, its legs dragging behind it as it pulls closer to you. It lets out a low guttural moan as it grasps towards you, hungry to fill itself with your insides.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to Study a Skin Crawler, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Unrestrained Undead. You recognize the Skin Crawler's creature type, Resistances, and Immunities.

(15+) Deathly Aware. You learn of the Skin Crawler's mental ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Skin Crawler is a mindless creature. It is nothing but animated flesh seeking to consume. If it senses a living creature nearby, it crawls towards it with total disregard for its own life. It only wants to bind the living and squeeze them to death while slowly devouring their flesh, consuming it into itself.
    A Skin Crawler is too focused to flee and continues to attempt to devour a target until either it or their target is dead.

    <description>A flock of hairless, winged creatures, each roughly the size of a large dog, circle overhead. Each is a grotesque patchwork of various animals melded together through unspeakable magical experiments. Their bloated bodies are made from combinations of pigs, goats, and sheep torsos. Their featherless wings are poorly structured with visible bones and thin, tearing skin. Each has a ram-shaped head with mismatched, bulging eyes and twisted horns; the nose and mouth have been replaced with a curved avian beak, each disturbingly filled with rows of irregular teeth and leaking a foul, sticky saliva. The monsters move with an awkward gait, their strained bodies supported by sturdy but mismatched donkey legs, and forelimbs which end in a hodgepodge digits with different claws, talons, and claws.

Study The Foe

(15+) Flying Packs. You know the Skinwing's Pack Tactics trait.
(20+) Muddled Mind. You learn the Skinwing's Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma ability scores.

Combat Tactics
Skinwings look for opportunities to gang up on a single target, relying on their Pack Tactics to swarm and overpower an enemy.

    <description>A looming avian creature perches on the rooftop above, its body cloaked in dirty, ragged feathers. It curiously regards you with its two featherless heads, each borne on a long, crooked neck. Each head has large, round, bulging eyes and a hooked beak that drips corrosive saliva which hisses as it strikes the ground. The bird launches from its perch, opening its broad wings and short, fan- shaped tail, revealing a hanging, bloated belly that shudders with whatever half-digested contents rot within.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Skretch, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Flying Scavenger. You recognize it may be possible to distract it with meat, offal, or strong-smelling food.
(10+) Acidic Vomit. You learn of the Skretch's Expel Waste and Spittle actions.
(15+) Dextrous and Sturdy. You recognize the creature's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Skretches keep to high perches and observe potential prey before attacking. A Skretch prefers to attack targets that are visibly injured, weakened, or otherwise vulnerable.
    Once it finds a suitable quarry, a Skretch circles their prey overhead pelting them with Spittle while waiting for their Expel Waste to recharge. Since its attacks require the Skretch to be directly overhead its target, they prefer to keep well above their targets to avoid any projectiles or ranged attacks.
    A Skretch never enters close combat willingly. If it is engaged up close, it uses the Disengage action to flee. As lazy scavengers, a Skretch doesn't pursue its prey very far or into buildings and flees if reduced to half its Hit Points or fewer.

    <description>Resting on the apothecary's desk, amidst vials, surgical implements, and scattered anatomical notes tomes is a skull, ordinary at first glance. It lies motionless — but then it begins to stir, hovering an inch above the wooden surface. Its eye sockets, dark and hollow, seem to fix on you, its bony grin frozen in a sinister smirk. The skull begins to speak, its voice a chilling murmur. " You're not one of the doctor's patients…" it hisses. " You should not be here…"

Player Character Familiars
Subject to GM approval, an apothecary with the Laboratory Assistant esoteric theory can create a Helpful Hand or Speaking Skull to serve them using the Find Familiar spell. A familiar created in this manner always acts in combat immediately after its creator's turn. It can use its special attacks in its stat block only if the apothecary uses a Bonus Action on their turn to command the familiar to take one of those actions.

    A creature within 5 feet can take an action to detach the leech with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

    <description>The black, plump wriggling form of the leech squirms and crawls. Its oily, slick skin is wet and slippery. It lets out a high-pitched screech as it lunges towards its prey.

It is well understood by apothecaries, particularly Mutagenists, how arcane magical talents are the result of a nascent genetic trait borne in the blood. As such, Mutagenist apothecaries often experiment with blood and tissue samples taken from mageborn, hoping to discover the ways to enhance existing magical talents, or even imbue those without the inborn capacity for magic with spellcasting ability. Thus far, the best results have been either disastrous or temporary. Nevertheless, one result is the Spell Leech.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a leech, learning the following based on the result: 
(10+) Quick Swimmers. You know the leech's Swim speed and senses.
(15+) Arcane Ingestion. You recognize the Spell Leech's Spell Drain.

Combat Tactics
Leeches attempt to get close to a target to Bite and Attach to them. They do not retreat, as they are driven by their basic need to feed on the blood of others and nothing else.

(10+) Launched Spines. You recognize the Dreg's Spike attack.
(15+) Cunning and Agile. You understand the Dreg's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
Due to its agile nature and inherent Climb speed, the Spined Dreg prefers vantage points on low roofs or second stories of ruined buildings. It tends to avoid openly traversing the streets, and usually attacks from a distance or to leap down upon its enemies and grapple them. They will climb up walls to escape if reduced below half their Hit Points and outnumbered.

The cloth is filled with writhing tentacles, which dangle out from its depths, poking and prodding about. 

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Star Warden, learning the following based on the result.

Combat Tactics
Star wardens exist in multiple times and dimensions at once. A creature that tries to fight a star warden is at a loss for where and how the star warden exists before it. Both the Star Warden and the creatures facing it are constantly shifted around the battlefield, unable to grasp their sense of reality. The Star Warden uses its Outside Time and Space Reaction to let two creatures attack one another instead of landing a blow upon itself. It can force the truth of all reality into a creature's mind or have it experience the cold vastness of space. Star Wardens are clever and always flee a losing fight.

      <text>Melee Attack Roll: +9, reach 10 ft. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) Piercing damage. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 17. Failure: The target has a body part bound and sewn up (stitcher's choice): 
• Eyes. The target has the Blinded condition. 
• Mouth. The target cannot speak and cannot cast spells with a verbal component. 
• Limbs. The target has the Restrained condition.
A creature within 5 feet can take an action to remove the threads with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect. Failure: The threads are removed but the target takes 11 (2d10) Slashing damage. Failure by 5 or More: The target takes 11 (2d10) Slashing damage and the threads aren't removed.</text>

      <text>Strength Saving Throw: DC 17, one creature the stitcher can see within 10 feet (Grappled, Slowed, Restrained, Incapacitated, and Immobilized creatures have Disadvantage). Failure: The target makes a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a success, it controls the limb until the start of its next turn. Otherwise, the limb is uncontrolled for the same duration. The target suffers one of the following effects depending on the attached limb: 
h Head. While controlled, the target has Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma-based D20 Tests. While uncontrolled, the target can control its action or its movement on its turn, but the head controls the other. On a failure by 5 or more, the head chooses which to control instead of the target. 
h Arm. While controlled, the target can take an extra action on its turn, choosing from the Attack (one weapon attack only) or Utilize actions. While uncontrolled, the extra arm makes one melee weapon attack against the target at the start of its turn. The arm has a +9 attack bonus and deals 14 (3d6 + 4) Bludgeoning damage on a hit. 
h Leg. While controlled, the target can take an extra action on its turn, choosing from the Dash or Disengage actions. While uncontrolled, the leg forces the target to move up to its Speed in a random direction at the start of its turn. If this movement forces the target toward a hazard or precipice, the host can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, it stops its movement and has the Prone condition before entering the hazard. 
An attached limb can be attacked (AC 20, 20 Hit Points, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage). A creature within 5 feet can take an action to remove the limb with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Medicine) check or DC 15 Strength check. When removed by any means other than a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check, the target takes 18 (4d8) Necrotic damage and has the Bleeding condition (4d4).</text>

    <description>The creature before you has an oversized clawed hand of deadly scissors, blades, surgical instruments, and scalpels. The other hand is completely replaced with a set of interwoven needles on pistons. The figure is tall and emaciated, with tight skin stretched over lithe muscles. Its long and slender neck ends in a small bald head with beady black eyes and multiple straps that are connected to its mouth, keeping it pried open. A spool of fine thread is fastened into its gaping mouth, and its ribcage is splayed open with flowing bandages on a spool that is fitted into place within. It wears stained and stitched rags and carries a large burlap sack stained in blood, multiple severed limbs hanging out of the open bag.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Stitcher, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Fearless and Enduring. You are aware of the Stitcher's damage and condition Immunities.
(15+) Instantaneous Grafter. You know the creature's Sewing Needle attack.
(20+) Brainless Monster. You learn the Stitcher's Charisma saving throw.

Combat Tactics
The Stitcher has a singular, focused mind, and even when defending itself, uses its sewing and surgical skills to sew up its foes. The Stitcher often identifies what the most advantageous option is for its Sewing Needle, focusing on the mouths of spellcasters, the limbs of melee combatants, and the eyes of ranged combatants. It attempts to attach limbs to victims it has sewn up.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Storm Troll, learning the following information based on the result:
 (5+) From Harsh Environments. You know the troll's Immunities. 
(10+) Hard to Kill. You learn of the troll's Regeneration trait. 
(15+) Special Weakness. You have insight into the troll's Vulnerabilities.

Combat Tactics
Storm Trolls hunt for food during heavy rainfall or bad storms. Often accompanied by cracks of thunder and flashes of lightning, they begin combat by hurling lightning at their foes before rushing in to maul them with their Claws and Bites. 
    If a Storm Troll takes Acid damage, it immediately flees and attempts to find a safe place to recuperate.

(20+) Defeatable Undeath. You know the creature's lowest ability scores and Vampire Weaknesses.

Combat Tactics
The Striga is a vampire warped by delerium and contamination. It loses its inhibitions and subtlety, becoming a ravenous bloodthirsty monster. The Striga charges into battle and aggressively pursues its foes, clawing and howling as it hunts its prey. The Striga attempts to single out a weak target and tears them to shreds before moving on to the next.
    A Striga rarely flees as it is too bloodthirsty to consider its own life.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Swarm of Ratlings, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Fighting Horde. You are aware of the swarm's Resistances, Immunities, speeds, and senses, as well as its Swarm trait.
(15+) Overwhelming Numbers. You learn of this creature's Chittering Mass and Scurrying Horde traits.
(20+) Neither Strong Nor Brave. You recognize the swarm's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Swarm of Ratlings is an alternative way to represent a massive number of ratlings, rather than needing to use dozens of individually weak ratling minions in an encounter against higher-level characters.
    In battle the Swarm of Ratlings moves like a rolling tide, using its Scurrying Horde Bonus Action to close the distance with as many targets as possible. The swarm tries to move into and over the spaces of its enemies, so it can Bite them with Advantage using its Chittering Mass trait. The swarm continues making Bite attacks against a downed character in its space as the swarm goes into a feeding frenzy.
    The Swarm of Ratlings is impossibly brave until it's reduced to 0 Hit Points, at which point the Scampering Survivors usually try to run away.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) check to Study a Tentacled Dreg, learning the following based on their result:

(10+) Squeezing Death. You learn of the Dreg's Constrict attack.
(15+) Physically Strong. You are aware of the Dreg's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Tentacled Dreg can use its tentacles to climb and swim much better than other Dregs, and so it likes to hide on perches or in water waiting for its unfortunate prey to come near. When it attacks, it Constricts its target, squeezing them to death with its many tentacles.
    If outnumbered and below half of its Hit Points, a Tentacled Dreg will attempt to climb or swim to safety.

    </action>
    <action>
      <name>Assuming Direct Control (1/round)</name>
      <text>The Algorithm targets a Construct within 120 feet and immediately enters and takes control of it. The Algorithm can still use its Epic Actions as normal and replaces the Construct's game statistics with its own, except the Construct's Hit Points.

      <text>The Algorithm casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 27):

    <description>It is a vast network of wires, tubes, and metal plating in an ever shifting and malleable form. This massive construct often appears as a giant robotic face floating through the void, with a tail of writhing mechanical tendrils drifting behind it like a massive inorganic squid. It uses the plates and chunks of liquid metal orbiting around it to reshape itself, creating limbs and changing features as parts remove or attach to its ever-shifting form. The whirring of electrical energy and mechanical sounds compile into a booming chorus of auto-tuned robotic voices. Its cold, unfeeling eyes analytically survey its surroundings, assessing the information before calculating the optimal way to reorganize its form in response to the situation.

Roleplaying Traits
The Algorithm is nigh incomprehensible.
• Personality Trait. "I speak down to mortal creatures, for they cannot begin to comprehend the depth of my knowledge, or the details of the cosmos. They are but simple accidents in a sea of chaos that must be corrected."
• Bond. "I am bound to the order of all things, It is my cosmic ordained purpose to bring order to the chaos of the universe."
• Ideal. "Order out of Chaos is perfection, I will achieve perfection."
• Flaw. "No one is as humble as I!"


Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks when they take the Study action to examine The Algorithm, learning the following based on their result:
(20+) Practically Impervious. You learn the Algorithm's Immunities.
(25+) Order and Consequence. You are aware of the creature's Predictive Analytics trait.
(30+) Enduring Intellect. You recognize The Algorithm's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Algorithm is a creature of order and consequence. It sees all of the Space Between Worlds and every reality as a confusing mass of chaos that must be rearranged and perfected. When The Algorithm encounters mortal creatures, it will attempt to organize them as best suits it using its wires and Algorithmic Manipulation to forcibly move them.
    It will convert problematic creatures into obedient androids using its Reprogram ability, and any who threaten it are reduced to atoms using Deatomization.
    If The Algorithm has created a cyborg using Reprogram, or if there are extra constructs from previous failed experiments nearby, The Algorithm can assume direct control of them, deatomizating itself and entering the construct to use as a suit of armor.
    If the combat becomes too stressful or problematic for The Algorithm, and it is unable to control or organize the situation in a way that benefits it, it may get frustrated and begin deatomizating everything. If that doesn't work, it flees into the void to find something more easily manipulated to work on.

If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and have the Prone condition.</text>

    <description>This horrific monstrosity is larger than a whale. It has a long, serpentine body bristling with sleek fins, undulating barbed tentacles, and rubbery, purple-black flesh. It writhes through the waves with unearthly grace despite its bulk, and seeping from its flaps and vents are secretions of a thick, oozing oil which shimmers with prismatic hues. It has adorned its brow with fishing nets, coral, sea debris, and delerium crystals, resembling a coronet and jewelry. As you look upon its form, you feel a slight headache, a buzzing in your ear, and a pressing in your chest; as if the psychic presence of this otherworldly creature has conjured the crushing pressure of the abyssal depths. It has a gigantic, fanged maw which it holds agape. Seaweed, fish entrails, and slime dribble from between its sharp teeth, and its bulbous eyes glow with octarine light.

Roleplaying Traits
The Duchess has powerful and otherworldly psychic powers. They can communicate telepathically, read the thoughts of mortals, and use their psionic power to turn mortals into its contaminated thralls. It makes deceptive offers that appeal to characters' deepest desires, manipulating them into embracing contamination. Those under its control slowly mutate, taking on horrific aquatic features.
    The Duchess hopes to open a dimensional rift so she can conjure other beings like herself, styling herself no longer as a duchess—but an empress.
• Personality Trait. "What horrific condition afflicts the land-dwellers! How awful must it be that you cannot live in the wonderful sea … such a terrible curse which keeps you bound to the land…"
• Ideal. "My magic will weaken the curse which holds you to the land, so you might swim through the waves of my court, and be welcomed as one of my loyal subjects! Perhaps you will be worthy enough to become one of my valiant knights!"
• Bond. "Come see the wondrous treasures of my Grotto! Gaze upon the opalescent, prismatic beauty of my prized coral. You may hold it in your hands, for a while, if you wish…"
• Flaw. "I abhor the land, and will never set scale or fin upon it."

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature or Survival gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine the Duchess. They learn the following information based on their check result.
(10+) Eldritch Abomination. You understand her Resistances and Immunities.
(15+) Thought Control. You recognize her Deep Domination ability.
(20+) Water Affinity. You learn of the Duchess's Moisture Regeneration ability.

Combat Tactics
The Duchess never confronts her enemies on their terms, preferring to stay in her lair where it is safe. She ventures as far as the edges of contaminated water, knowing full well that the water sustains her. When confronting foes in combat, she uses her Deep Domination on her enemies while calling in reinforcements with Call of the Deep. She grabs foes and flings them away to keep her enemies focused on her dominated minions.
    Unless in her lair, she flees the moment she doesn't like the odds of a fight. If she is in her lair, she flees only if she is reduced below 100 Hit Points to attempt to find a new location in contaminated water to build a new lair.

Incapacitated condition. The Thing with the Writhing Tail can have up to eight illusory duplicates at a time. While it has one or more duplicates, it has the following benefits: 
• Attacks and Spells. The Thing with the Writhing Tail can cast spells, use Tail Whip, and make Claw attacks as if it was in an illusory duplicate's space. 
• Aura Expansion. Each illusory duplicate emanates a Purring Aura. The effects of multiple overlapping auras do not stack; a creature is only affected once by the Purring Aura even if it is within range of multiple Emanations. 
• Move. Each time the Thing with the Writhing Tail takes this Epic Action, it can move any number of illusions up to 60 feet to unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of itself. 
• Distract. When both the Thing with the Writhing Tail and one of its illusory duplicates are within 10 feet of a creature that can see them, the Thing with the Writhing Tail has Advantage on attack rolls against that creature.

    <description>This eldritch housecat possesses a sleek, undulating body that stretches out, impossibly long and sinuous, covered in a coat that swirls in blue and purple like the midnight cosmos, speckled with tiny flickering stars. Its fur seems to absorb light, creating a silhouette that shifts and wavers, as if its true form is utterly incomprehensible to your mind. The creature's striking eyes are large, luminous orbs that resemble nebulae, surging with vibrant colors that no earthly cat's eyes would possess. Its paws are tipped with claws made of a material resembling a dark, glassy substance, capable of tearing through the fabric of reality itself. Each step it takes resonates with a soft, eerie echo, as if it walks not just on the physical ground, but also treads through the layers of time and space. Its tail is elongated and flexible, flickering through the air like a dark, wraithlike appendage, constantly moving in patterns that defy the bounds of physical space.

Roleplaying Traits
This cosmic entity's interactions are marked by caprice and whimsy.
• Personality Trait. One moment, I might bestow affectionate purrs and nuzzles; the next, I display utter aloofness or sudden ire, swiping with claws of dark matter that rend the veil between sanity and madness.
• Ideal. My actions are neither cruel nor kind. Mortals cannot know my unfathomable perspective, and that is why they will always be inferior.
• Bond. I am endlessly entertained by the unpredictability of mortals; their fears, their surprises, and their schemes are like strings of yarn I cannot resist batting at with my cosmic paws.
• Flaw. My boundless curiosity and the mere whim to explore the forbidden often lead me to stir chaos in realms both mortal and divine, sometimes unraveling threads better left untouched.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Religion gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine the Thing with the Writhing Tail, learning the following based on their result:
(20+) Eldritch Aberration. You are aware of its Truesight and Telepathy, its Immunities, and its Epic Resistance. You also know this eldritch entity is beyond life and death and can reform years later if killed.
(25+) Fear and Madness. You learn of its Purring Aura, as well as its spellcasting Epic Actions.
(30+) Brilliant and Nimble. You know the Thing with the Writhing Tail's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
In battle, the Thing with the Writhing Tail uses Manifest Duplicate to create numerous copies of itself. It teleports and swaps places with its duplicates as it rends its foes apart. The many duplicates vastly expand the range of its Purring Aura, sowing terror and madness in any who try to oppose them. The Thing with the Writhing Tail may grow suddenly bored in the middle of combat, deciding to inexplicably flee or change tactics to a new fixation. Other times, it plays cat and mouse with its foes, toying with them like living balls of yarn.

Roleplaying Traits

• Personality Trait. I whisper softly in mortal's ears… What do you yearn for? I have no interest in using it against you… only in making it a reality. Indulge yourself for a change…
• Ideal. I want one thing, and one thing only…to provide you the thing you want most. Ask me, and I'll give it to you. What can I give you that you truly desire?
• Bond. If there's ever a stranger you can trust, it's me. Any deal we made would be signed and sealed. Other demons may utter lies, but I whisper promises…and I keep my promises.
• Flaw. Are you certain you would deny me? I dislike being turned down…why wait for what you deserve? If you change your mind…you need only whisper…and I'll be there…

(20+) Demonic Power. You are aware of its Truesight and Telepathy, its Immunities, and Epic Resistance. You also know this eldritch entity is beyond life and death and can reform years later if killed.
(25+) Enraptured Presence. You are aware of the creature's Alluring Aura trait.
(30+) Powerful Presence. You know The Whispered Promise's highest and lowest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Whispered Promise regards battle as a physical expression of their ability to control others. It uses Alluring Aura to prevent attacks and they negate resistances to its psychic onslaught by grappling with its Unravelling Resolve trait. They sow discord using Mass Suggestion, Dominate Monster, and their Dominate power, revealing in the resentment, jealousy, disdain, envy, and anger its foes have towards one another.

    <description>A storm of black clouds and sheets of octarine lightning fill the air, and unnatural otherworldly thunder crashes as a steady contaminated rain begins to pour.
    Rising from the shattered delerium heart in a plume of eldritch Haze, stands a creature as tall as a tower, its bulbous head adorned with octarine delerium crystals that crackle and spark with arcane energy. These crystals protrude from its flesh down its neck and across its shoulders, as well as down its spine. Seven massive yellow eyes peer out from below a furrowed brow, over a reptilian snout with a wide set mouth that stretches across its head filled with rows of jagged teeth. Its large, elongated maw opens to reveal one hundred thin translucent tentacles that lash and dart out like one hundred tongues. Its wet skin is a mottled grayish purple, shimmering in unknown colors impossible to comprehend.
    The Haze disperses in an instant as it rises from the Crater. Its four muscular arms end in hands with eight long spindly fingers, each tipped with a delerium clawed nail. Its large digitigrade legs end in veiny black hooves, and its rigid spine extends into three long, tentacle-like tails. The smell of ozone and sulfur fill the air, and a deep and booming voice utters words incomprehensible in a cadence unrecognizable to the human ear, merely coming through as a muffled tone of booming bass and high-pitched wails that causes your brain to seer in pain.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study The World Ender, learning the following based on their result:
(20+) Force of Destruction. You recognize The World Ender's Resistances, Immunities, and its Immutable Form trait.
(25+) Blast of Energy. You learn of the Ender's Charge Eradication Beam and Eradication Beam actions.
(30+) Nearly Unstoppable. You are aware of The World Ender's Rejuvenation trait.

Combat Tactics
The World Ender is a force of utter destruction. It cares little for the creatures or structures around it and merely tramples through them without hesitation or remorse. The World Ender unceasingly proceeds forward, and never halts unless it is somehow prevented from moving. It does not flee or hide and has no conception for surrender or fear. It is a force of nature that levels cities to the ground, leaving a path of utter destruction in its wake.
    Few creatures pose an actual threat to The World Ender, and it is content to simply smash them with its Necrotic Claws or devour them with its Bite. Indeed, it may not even attack them directly, making most of its attacks against structures or the environment itself and letting the falling rubble crush any it encounters. When confronted with a large obstacle or building, it stops to unleash its Eradication Beam to clear a path forward with no regard for anything in its way.
    However, if The World Ender is actually damaged by an attack or spell, it snaps into action and unleashes its Bellowing Roar in response. It follows up with its Ground Slam and then continues attacking until whatever injured it is slain. If it senses it is under attack by multiple foes (such as an approaching army), it aims its Eradication Beam to destroy them. The World Ender calls down Octarine Lightning Strikes against airborne opponents who target it from above, or against groups of foes on the ground.

Mysterious origin
Characters who confront The World Ender are the first to ever do so: none in the World of Drakkenheim have encountered this creature before nor know of its existence. There is no possible way to discover any information about this creature — not even its existence — until it is released. Even powerful divination magic fails to reveal anything other than a vague omen of unstoppable destruction and terrible consequences for destroying the Delerium Heart. For this reason, the details presented herein are framed as information that could be discovered following the emergence of the creature from the Crater.

Destructive Rampage
The World Ender's actions damage and destroy buildings and structures. A creature within 10 feet of a structure that is destroyed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (8d6) Bludgeoning damage. Any creature inside the structure when it is destroyed has Disadvantage on the saving throw.

However, it does not take an action or Bonus Action on its turn unless forced to do so by a spell or other effect.

    <action>
      <name>Contaminated Blast</name>
      <text>Melee or Ranged Attack Roll: +12, reach 10 ft., or range 120 ft. Hit: 32 (4d12 + 6) Necrotic damage. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 20. Failure: The target gains a Contamination level.</text>

    <action>
      <name>Elekinetic Grip</name>
      <text>The Think Tank reaches out with its mind to hold one creature or object it can see within 120 feet of it in its psychic grasp.

Failure: 28 (8d6) Force damage, and the target is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and has the Restrained condition until it escapes or the Think Tank has the Inca- pacitated condition. The Think Tank can hold up to two creatures or objects in its grip at one time. On its turn, a held creature can take an action to repeat the save, escaping the grip on a success. 
    If the target is an object weighing 1,000 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is telekinetically moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The Think Tank can also exert fine control on objects with its telekinesis, such as manipulating surgical tools or opening a door or a container.</text>

Failure: 33 (6d10) Psychic damage, and the target perceives itself to be trapped within a nightmare conjured forth from the depths of its own psyche until it escapes. While trapped, the target has the Immobilized, Blinded, and Deafened conditions. On its turn, the target can take an action to repeat the save. Each time it does, it takes 33 (6d10) psychic damage.

      <name>Unbind Gravity (1/round)</name>
      <text>The Think Tank controls gravity in a 200-foot Cube centered on itself until the end of the next round. Each time the Think Tank uses this Epic Action, it decides which direction gravity pulls within the area. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall in the chosen direction until they reach the edge of the area. A creature can make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, avoiding the fall on a success. 
    If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the edge of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration. 
    Alternatively, the Think Tank can decide to prevent gravity from acting within the area. When it does, creatures within the area without a Fly Speed levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. 
    Unattended objects float around randomly. If the Think Tank doesn't use this Epic Action during the next round, the effect ends and affected objects and creatures fall back down.</text>

    <description>A severed head bobs gently aloft. The top of its scalp has been sawed off, exposing its pulsing brain, which is encased in a dome filled with bubbling, glowing liquid. A dozen thin mechanical arms emerge from its eye sockets. Around each delicate limb is coiled an elongated strand of the optic nerve, and upon the tip of each are curiously blinking human eyes of different sizes and colors. A haphazard bundle of tubes, hoses, and cables flows from its open neck along the still-attached spine, which connects via several sinewy strands to an array of fluid-filled glass tanks containing a throbbing heart, pounding lungs, and other nearly unrecognizable internal organs. Attached to the spine are spindly mechanical arms each ending in human hands.

Roleplaying Traits
• Personality Trait. Too many thoughts, all the time, my mind is free, uncontained!
• Bond. I did what I had to! My mind was too valuable to let go to waste, I had to preserve it, to improve it!
• Ideal. I avoided death to continue to pursue the vast un- known of my scientific study. My research will change the world, I just need more time!
• Flaw. I cannot fathom the monster I have become, and to witness myself is a horror I cannot endure.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study the Think Tank, learning the following based on the result:
(15+) Tear the Mind. You recognize the Think Tank's Nightmare Aura.
(20+) Gravity Control. You know of the Think Tank's Unbind Gravity Epic Action.
(25+) Protected Regenerator. You learn of its Shield Generator and Life Support System traits and identifies its location.

Combat Tactics
Due to the nature of its Life Support System, the Think Tank is seldom encountered outside its lair, which is always a well-defended and secret location. The mastermind surrounds itself with powerful abominations, and protects its sanctum with traps, defensible locations, and escape routes. A Think Tank's lair may include elements that are outright hostile to living organisms, such as radiation, contamination, or deadly neurotoxin. As such, player characters encountering the Think Tank in combat must have already outmaneuvered it somehow to gain access to its innermost lair.
    The Think Tank makes for a climatic encounter against a villainous foe. Before the player characters even get close to the Think Tank, it will have tested their abilities many times against its minions, using its telepathic eavesdropping to learn everything it can about them. The Think Tank knows when they are coming, how they are approaching, as well as their abilities, spells, equipment, and their expected tactics.
    The Think Tank uses Unbind Gravity and Mind Cage to control the battlefield, while using Pluck the Puppet Strings to turn any remaining targets against its other foes. Its Telekinetic Grip can help it further control enemy positions while using Contaminated Blast to slowly contaminate them to death, picking on whoever has the most Contamination going into the encounter.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or any kind of artisan's tools gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a tower dragon. They learn the following information based on their check result.
(5+) Resistant Form. You know the creature's Resistances and Immunities.
(10+) Ceaseless Pursuit. You learn of the creature's Faultless Tracker trait.
(15+) Simple-Minded Construct. You are aware of the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
Tower Dragons defend strategic locations along the city walls. Most notably, these dragons animate to attack those who try to enter the city via the rivers, or any who attempt to fly above the walls of Castle Drakken. They are also drawn towards any extended engagement with Wall Gargoyles. Combat encounters lasting more than a minute against a gargoyle near the city walls will likely attract a Tower Dragon.
    Typically, Tower Dragons attack from above, using their crackling breath weapons to devastate targets. Once animated, a Tower Dragon does not give up pursuit of their target until either it or its quarry is destroyed.

Harvestable Components (Rare)
Animus. Dragon. Natural Weapons: Teeth, Claws. Hide: Plates, Scales. Dust. Draconic Dust.

    <description>Massive mounds of rippling, warty flesh, covered in molds and fungal growths protrude from this troll's hunched back. Inky black scraggly hair frames her face and beady red eyes pierce through the darkness. The Troll Hag is covered in tattered burlap and decaying foliage that hide her features. She scurries about on swollen, stumpy limbs, carrying a massive cauldron and ladle as she stirs an acrid concoction.

Mothers of Mushrooms
The Troll Hags are the keepers of fungus in the Trogrowth Forest of Caspia, and swamps all around the continent. They tend to mushroom gardens and carry large iron cauldrons filled with strange brews that they use to turn ordinary fungus into Trollings. Their gardens are family, and they protect them with their lives. If you go tromping through mushroom patches in a swamp, you best be ready to face the wrath of these mothers of mushrooms.

Covens and Community
Some Troll Hags are happy to live out their days undisturbed in the deepest reaches of dark forests and smelly swamps. They infest the forests with mushrooms and mycelia and keep their Trollings as family. Troll Hags have, in rare cases, formed covens of three. When these covens form it is often a problem, as three Troll Hags will overflow their territory with fungal growths, causing entire swamps and forests to decay, spilling hordes of Fungal Trolls into nearby villages and towns.
 
Roleplaying Traits
The following traits can be used to inspire roleplaying a Troll Hag:
• Personality Trait: "I care for the fungal growths of the forest as if they were my own dear children. I speak to them, sing to them, and care for them as a mother would."
• Bond: "I will protect my mushroom children with my life, for they are the sole reason I am here"
• Ideal: "All things rot and decay. I am the one who aids the forest in that natural process."
• Flaw: "I will not tolerate those who do not respect the forests and swamps. I will seek vengeance on any who harm the fungus."

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Survival or with a Herbalism Kit gain Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks when Studying a Troll Hag.
(15+) Potent Spellcaster. You are aware of her Spellcasting and Spore Step actions, as well as her Regeneration trait.
(20+) Dangerous Equipment. You learn her Fungal Staff and Slimeball attacks and her ability to spawn Fungal Trollings.
(15+) Special Weakness. You have insight into the troll's vulnerabilities, as well as her low Armor Class.

Combat Tactics
A Troll Hag prefers to keep her distance from her enemies, letting her fungal minions do the up-close work. If the hag finds herself in melee combat, she uses her Fungal Staff and then teleports away using Spore Step to hurl Slimeballs at her enemies.

    <description>It is rare for three Troll Hags to converge, but not unheard of. Often when three troll Hags find a secluded swamp to infest with their fungal growths, they work together to harness their powers and utterly change the nature of the heart of the swamp, causing the entire area to fill with their fungal delights. 
    A coven of Troll Hags often results in a small army of Fungal Trolls emerging and disrupting nearby villages, farms, and anyone unlucky enough to travel near their swamps. The trees and foliage change to fungal growths that confuse and disorient anyone attempting to navigate it.
    If three Troll Hags form a coven, their AC becomes 15, and they are Challenge Rating 10

    <description>The strange creature appears to be a glistening growth of mucus-filled flesh upon a mass of boneless skin that slowly wriggles about. It shifts within its own reality, like a faded illusion, slipping between multiple locations. The growth jiggles and wobbles as it moves. Acidic mucus and saliva leaks from small, sharp mandibles. It hisses as it drips to the ground around it. Somehow, as the creature moves, reality around it seems to vibrate and fold as if the arcane energies found in Drakkenheim are concentrating around it like a slow and steady breath.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study an Undulating Polyp, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Resistant Aberration. You learn of the Undulating Polyp's creature type, Resistances, and Immunities.
(10+) Teleporting Terror. You are aware of the polyp's Slip Space action and Confused Realities Reaction.
(15+) Pointed Vulnerability. You recognize the polyp's Vulnerability to Piercing damage.

Combat Tactics
Undulating Polyps are quite adept at staying away from predators. They use their various methods of teleportation to avoid dangers and move to a better position. The polyp constantly showers the battlefield in acidic slime as another method of protecting itself. Undulating Polyps are not combatants and will do their best to escape combat if they feel threatened.

Harvestable Components (Rare)
Animus: Aberration. Fluid: Contaminated Ichor, Goopy Ooze, Acidic Bile, Mucus. Natural Weapons: Mandibles. Hide: Skin. Dust: Aberrant Dust.

    <description>The humanoids that stand before you appear wrong. The longer you look at them, the more unsettling they become. Although they resemble humanoid creatures, their features are twisted in peculiar ways. One is completely faceless, with nothing more than a smooth fleshy patch on its head. Another has arms that are too long, with two budding elbows, and insectoid eyes. Another still moves in a gaunt, sporadic pattern, leaving behind momentary blips of itself as if for the briefest of moments it exists in two places at once. All look pale, their skin taking on a faded bluish-purple tone, and those that have eyes have glowing octarine irises. 

Myriad Forms of Chaos
Void Pirates take on all manner of unusual quirks and physical attributes that represent their prolonged exposure to the shifting chaos of the Space Between Worlds. 
1. No Face. It has no face, only a smooth fleshy surface.
2. Eyes! Either not enough, or far too many, glow with an octarine haze.
3. Twinsies. Two of these creatures are identical in every way. They in fact are the same creature fractured in time.
4. Disjointed. The creature's limbs have extra joints, or its joints bend the wrong way.
5. Cosmic Flesh. The creature's flesh is a fractal distortion of light and energy. 
6. Phasing. The creature moves in and out of space, sometimes briefly appearing in two places at once as they walk around. 
7. Impossible Dimensions. The creature cannot be viewed from any perspective except straight on. Attempts to move around them fail as they seem to move with you, as if they are simply two-dimensional in a three-dimensional space. 
8. Ventriloquist. The sound of the creature's echoing voice seems to come from anywhere except their mouth. 
9. Inside Out. This creature appears to be inside out, their veins and organs exposed.
10. Insectoid. This creature has taken on qualities of insects in their physical appearance, forming insect eyes, limbs, or mandibles. 
11. Octarine Lamp. This creature has a single eyeless socket, but instead of an eye, it emits a glowing octarine light. 
12. Does this look infected? This creature is swollen and leaking puss and ooze from various open sores upon its body, at times bubbling or spurting with neon colored goop.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Void Pirate, learning the following based on the result.
(5+) Mortal Survivors. You learn the creature's type. 
(10+) Battle Readiness. You recognize the creature's Bonus Action. 
(15+) Varied Abilities. They learn the creature's highest and lowest ability scores. 

Combat Tactics
Void Pirates often attempt to abduct creatures rather than kill them. They fight without honor, aiming to quickly outnumber and out maneuver opponents. Many target threatening enemies with ship-mounted weapons, or they move in close to use nets and shackles to capture other humanoids. They nearly always take prisoners unless forced to kill a target. If a creature persistently attacks or breaks free, they may decide to slit their throat and use them as bait. They flee if they risk defeat. Their lives are more valuable to them than prisoners or treasure. 

Harvestable Components
Due to their humanoid origins, these creatures cannot be harvested.

12. Does this look infected? This creature is swollen and leaking puss and ooze from various open sores upon its body, at times bubbling or spurting with neon colored goop.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Void Pirate, learning the following based on the result.
(5+) Mortal Survivors. You learn the creature's type. 
(10+) Battle Readiness. You recognize the creature's Bonus Action. 
(15+) Varied Abilities. They learn the creature's highest and lowest ability scores. 

Combat Tactics
Void Pirates often attempt to abduct creatures rather than kill them. They fight without honor, aiming to quickly outnumber and out maneuver opponents. Many target threatening enemies with ship-mounted weapons, or they move in close to use nets and shackles to capture other humanoids. They nearly always take prisoners unless forced to kill a target. If a creature persistently attacks or breaks free, they may decide to slit their throat and use them as bait. They flee if they risk defeat. Their lives are more valuable to them than prisoners or treasure. 

Harvestable Components
Due to their humanoid origins, these creatures cannot be harvested.

    <description>A rich outcrop of delerium crystals glimmer from the collapsed ruin nearby. As you approach, the debris begins to shift and move. A hunched, hulking form, one vaguely humanoid, rises up with a chorus of crystalline clinks and grinding rock. The central mass of stone and crystal is supported by two short, stubbly legs of rubble, its arms and shoulders shaped from large boulders of brick and wood that end in balled fists bristling with delerium spikes. Its head, an elongated crystal, is marked by angles and fractures that gradually form into a sorrowful face.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they Study a Walking Delerium Geode, learning the following based on their result:
(10+) Dense Delerium. You are aware of the elemental's Immunities.
(15+) Pummeled Contamination. Unsurprisingly, hits from this elemental's fists cause Contamination.
(20+) Deadly Destruction. You learn of the creature's Death Burst trait, as well as its strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
The Walking Delerium Geode rests in wait unless disturbed by someone trying to harvest its delerium crystals. Once awoken, it hammers targets with its Shard Slam.

Harvestable Components (Rare)
Animus. Elemental. Fluid: Contaminated Ichor. Dust: Elemental Dust.
Delerium. True to its name and nature, characters may be able to collect delerium from the remains of the Walking Delerium Geode, though its destruction tends to cause many crystals to shatter and break. Roll 1d20 to determine what the characters can find: 1: nothing remains but broken splinters and ash; 2–9: 4d6 delerium chips; 10–12: 3d10 delerium fragments; 13-16: 2d6 delerium shards; 17–19: 1d4 delerium crystals; 20: 1 delerium geode.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or any kind of artisan's tools gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Wall Gargoyle, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Resistant Form. You know the creature's Immunities.
(10+) Ceaseless Pursuit. You learn of the creature's Faultless Tracker trait.
(15+) Simple-Minded Construct. You are aware of the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.

Combat Tactics
Wall Gargoyles are found only along the city walls. They animate and attack characters who dare attempt any of the following: Climbing more than halfway up the walls or towers, flying within one hundred fifty feet of the city walls horizontally, or over them at any height, or lingering on the walls or towers for more than ten minutes.
    The gargoyles attack directly, viciously, and without remorse. If they reduce their quarry to 0 Hit Points, they spend their next turn tearing apart the creature's body before moving on to another target. The gargoyles pursue their quarry into the city to any distance until they or their quarry are destroyed, but give up pursuing characters more than three hundred feet outside the city walls.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Religion gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks to Study a Warlock of the Rat God, learning the following based on the result:
(5+) Otherworldly Pact. You are aware these creatures have an excellent sense of smell, Darkvision, are capable climbers and swimmers and this ratling's damage Resistances.
(10+) Potent Spellcasting. You learn of the ratling's Balefire and Conjure Swarms actions.
(15+) Commanding but Frail. You know the ratling's strongest and weakest ability scores and saving throws.

Combat Tactics
A Warlock of the Rat God does everything in its power to put "lesser" ratlings between it and its enemies. They deem themselves far too valuable to be put in harm's way, but are also inherently overconfident in their powers, convinced the Rat God protects them from harm.
    A Warlock of the Rat God will have likely cast Mage Armor on itself prior to rolling Initiative, as most keep this spell active when venturing out of their burrow, or at the first sign of danger. They conjure a Swarm of Rats to pester their enemies, and use Balefire to pummel their foes. When their defenses are exhausted they cast Invisibility on themselves and attempt to flee using Teleport.

The beast has eight legs and no visible eyes or mouth, but in place of a head or tail, a mass of tentacles emerge from its body. The tentacles extend to great lengths, and along its back its spine splits open revealing a great maw of jagged bone and teeth that gives way to a temporal rift in space and time.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Warp Marauder, learning the following based on the result.

(15+) Reality Distortion. You are aware of the creature's Swirling Color Field trait. 
(20+) Strong and Nimble. You know the creature's highest and lowest ability scores. 

Combat Tactics
The Warp Marauder has control over the reality around it. It grabs creatures and drags them into extraplanar realities where it feeds on them. The lupine alien isn't afraid to be hit, relying on its ability to alter time and space from an incoming attack, directing an essence of chaotic circumstance back towards the creature.Warp Marauders flee if they are reduced below half their Hit Points.

The witch can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead. The witch retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions. It otherwise uses the possessed target's game statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. 
    The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 Hit Points, the witch ends it as a Bonus Action, or the witch is turned or forced out by an effect like the Dispel Evil and Good spell.

Their mouth stretches unnaturally as they unleash an ear-piercing scream.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana gain Advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks to Study a Warp Witch, learning the following based on their result:
(5+) Resistant Undead. You learn of the Warp Witch's Resistances and Immunities.
(10+) Mutative Control. You recognize the creature's Possession action and Mutate Host Bonus Action, but not the means to end the possession.
(15+) Escaping Possession. You are aware that the Warp Witch's Possession can be ended by reducing the possessed body to 0 Hit Points, or by casting Dispel Evil and Good.

Combat Tactics
A Warp Witch begins combat by using its Psychic Scream. The witch then selects a target amongst their foes to possess. 
    While possessing a host, the Warp Witch will try to use the body to deceive or trick allies of its host into not attacking or harming them, trying to suggest useless, ineffective, and half-mad courses of action to "help" the host "drive out" the spirit, such as whistling, dancing, clapping, singing, drawing pictures, and other bizarre commands. Meanwhile, the witch continues to use Mutate Host to contaminate them. The Warp Witch leaves the host after they undergo a Monstrous Transformation, and then moves to repeat the process with another.

    <description>These sickly figures look frail and weak, their flesh pale and sagging, and their eyes sunken and hollow. They wear little more than light fabric gowns, blood- or pus-soaked bandages, tattered rags, or dirty garments. Some of them are covered in blisters or soars, others bleed from the ears, nose, or mouth. They mutter to themselves mad gibberish and whispered ideas.

Desperate Vanity. Lesser nobles and vain merchants occasionally seek out apothecaries not for a cure to an ailment, injury, or sickness, but in the hopes of augmenting some quality of themselves they find deficient. These individuals may come to an apothecary looking for a miraculous means to become taller or more comely, reverse aging, or even gain supernatural or magical abilities.

Medical Malpractice. Unfortunately for their patients, unscrupulous apothecaries may be perfectly willing to offer an experimental method or untested procedure in exchange for an affordable price, seeking an opportunity to trial their latest concoction upon a hapless yet willing subject. When these ill-conceived techniques inevitably go awry, the subjects find themselves transformed into a grotesque mockery of themselves.

Promised Cure. The transformation leaves the patient half-mad. Some are manipulated in the hopes of being cured one day, or tricked into believing that they must remain in the care of their "doctor" until they have "recovered" from the procedure. Many lash out in rage, fleeing into the wilderness, back alleys, or hidden away in their homes. Those unable to return to their former lives in fear or shame may remain, however.

Useful Lackeys. Left without the means to restore their former appearance, these wretched patients accept roles as orderlies, guards, and assistants to the apothecary responsible for their tormented contention. Truly psychotic apothecaries may increase their control over their patients through invasive brain surgery, chemical conditioning, and forced indoctrination. These terrible procedures render these unfortunate individuals fiercely loyal to the apothecary, imbuing them with a fanatical drive to protect them even at the cost of their own lives.

The Varied Victims of Many Malpractices. Wretched Patients represent the unfortunate victims of apothecaries' experiments. No matter their area of study, the deranged minds of evil scientists know no bounds with their experimentation on willing subjects in the name of occult science.

Alienist. Often those with mental instability or muddle minds turn to an Alienist. These patients are rendered into mindless and obedient servants through mind control, mental conditioning, and mind-altering procedures. Alienists have been known to go as far as remove portions of their victims' brains or remove their brains entirely while keeping the subject alive.

Chemist. Those looking for tinctures and tonics to ease all manner of ailments have turned to Chemists, often unaware of the danger of their compounds. These patients are often subject to new experimental procedures that leave them burned, or scarred, disfigured by chemical research. In some cases, the chemical procedures can leave the victims hairless, blind, or cause their skin to muddle and scar over completely.

Exorcist. An Exorcist's patients seek help with possessions that may or may not be real. These haunted people can find themselves at the hands of mad scientists and spiritualists who will use the willing patient to summon or trap demonic forces. Sometimes these patients are simply what remains after a demonic or spiritual possession, where after the removal, the victim is left numb and catatonic, having lost most of themselves to the entity that inhabited them. More sinister exorcists will perform this procedure on purpose, placing powerful entities into a patient, only to remove it and render the patient hollow and willing to become a subject to the apothecary.

Mutagenist. The failed experiments of a Mutagenist can leave all manner of strange disfigurations and abnormalities upon their patients. Everything from unusual growths, cankers, and tumors, to fully growing extra limbs, eyes, mouths, and other such strange occurrences. These patients become hideous mockeries of their former selves and over time, become reliant on the doctor to keep their growths and mutations in check.

Pathogenist. When sick with disease, or dealing with unknown poisons, subjects will go to a Pathogenist. Those who take their practices too far often use subjects as vessels for experimentation. Subjects are often riddled with diseases, sores, boils, at times losing their teeth and fingernails to unnatural decay, their skin turning shades of yellow, green, or purple. They appear sickly, carrying many pathogens, toxins, and diseases.

Reanimator. Reanimators are sought out when a patient has lost a limb, or had severe injury that would leave them scarred or disfigured. The Reanimators who take their practice too far will use the subject as a means of experimentation. Attaching new limbs to them, testing the lengths they can go by adding multiple limbs, or a second head, additional fingers or toes, subjects over time can become a patchwork of various parts that have been removed, reattached, or swapped.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Medicine gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to Study a Wretched Patient, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Broken by Experimentation. You know the creature's Conditioned Obedience trait.
(15+) Fervent Loyalty. You know these creatures protect their creator via their Protective Impulse Reaction.

Combat Tactics
Wretched Patients are simple minions. They defend themselves and reluctantly fight at the command of their creator. If their creator dies, Wretched Patients flee or cower.

    <description>This unearthly dragon is a crystalline horror, its body formed from angular gem-like scales pulsing with octarine light. Its form is raw delerium. Each scale is a gleaming crystal refracting light into eerie hues of purple, yellow, and green, with an unnatural sharpness that feels both fragile and impossibly durable.
    The dragon's wings are translucent and webbed with glowing crystal veins that shimmer, casting kaleidoscopic patterns as it moves. Each beat causes the air to hum, vibrating with a chaotic energy that overwhelms and distorts the senses. Each step the dragon takes leaves delicate motes of crystal growing into jagged formations, tainting the landscape. Its eyes are like multifaceted gems, swirling with chaotic magic pooling within their depths. 
    The beast's crystalline horns and talons are razor-sharp, gleaming like polished jewels, yet crackling with eldritch energy.

Explorers of many worlds and vistas, Young Delerium Dragons venture throughout the Space Between Worlds, ranging far and wide in search of meaning among meaninglessness, form amongst formlessness. 

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine a Delerium Dragon, learning the following based on the result.
(15+) Empowered by Eldritch Magic. You understand the dragon's Resistances and senses.
(20+) Octarine Breath. You recognize the effects of the Delerium Dragon's breath weapon, as well as noting its Spellcasting capabilities.
(25+) Few Weaknesses. You learn its highest and lowest saving throws. 

Combat Tactics
A Delerium Dragon views combat less as a violent encounter and more as a chance to change foes into a new form. It darts about using flight and teleportation, seldom remaining in the same place for more than a turn. Their movement makes it easy for the dragon to find the perfect place to catch many enemies with its breath weapon. Delerium Dragons love to spread contamination and cause arcane anomalies, and delight causing monstrous transformations with their contaminated attacks. 
    Delerium Dragons use their Bite, Contaminated Rend, and Tail attacks to tear opponents apart in between uses of their breath weapon.

Harvestable Components (Rare)
Animus: Aberration. Fluid: Monster Blood, Contaminated Ichor. Organs: Eyes, Heart, Brain, Guts, Glands, Flesh. Bones: Skull, Spine, Ribs. Natural Weapons: Claws, Teeth. Hide: Scales, Webbed Membrane. Dust: Aberrant Dust. 
Delerium. In addition, characters can collect delerium crystals from its body. A young dragon has 2d8 shards.

Falling Fire Combat Tactics
Falling Fire pilgrims give up their possessions and wealth and often carry very little on them. For the most part, common Falling Fire devotees are not equipped to fight. Most members try to avoid combat. Preferring a peaceful approach, they are more reactionary in their tactics and hope most situations do not come to bloodshed. However, Drakkenheim is a dangerous city, and monsters and bandits have attempted to thwart the efforts of the devout worshippers often. Pilgrims have been known to take up clubs, daggers, and any mundane weapons they can find to defend themselves, and often groups of traveling pilgrims are accompanied by armored zealots and spellcasting divine leaders who are ready to protect their flock.

    <description>This humanoid almost resembles a painted, weathered statue, adorned with tattoos depicting ravens, skulls, and lines of blood. It moves with inhuman speed and glares at you with its hungry, bloodshot eyes. Pointed fangs poke from their cracked lips and a look of a predator preparing for a hunt — and a meal — grows on their face. Saying not a single word, the zealot howls to the moon. Its quarry is a faithful sacrifice to Morrigan, who witnesses from afar. Bearing no weapons but their claws, fangs, and brute strength, the zealot dashes forward, beginning the hunt!

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in Arcana or Religion gain Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks when taking the Study action to examine it, learning the following based on the result:
(10+) Angry Undead. You recognize the creature's Morrigan's Fury bonus action.
(15+) Rejuvenating Violence. You learn of the creature's Blood Shield trait.
(20+) Swift and Strong. You know the creature's highest and lowest ability scores as well as its Vampire Weaknesses.

Combat Tactics
As soon as a Zealot of Morrigan gets the scent of combat, they use their bonus action to enter Morrigan's Fury, amplifying their damage and bolstering them against assault. With their superior speed, they zone in on the easiest meal within range, assailing them with their claws and fangs. The blood spilt from these attacks then serves as a buffer, fuelling their Blood Shield. In their fury, the zealots have no sense of survival or self-preservation, as they fight to the death.
