  <description>A brand new adventure from ENNIE Award-winning creators the Dungeon Dudes!

Embark on a perilous journey through the contaminated ruins of Drakkenheim with In Search of the Smuggler's Secrets, a thrilling fifth edition adventure for 3rd level characters. Traverse treacherous sewers, face mutated horrors, and uncover hidden passages while navigating alliances with rival factions.

This adventure was inspired by the earliest escapades from our Dungeons of Drakkenheim series, where Sebastian, Veo, and Pluto navigated the contaminated sewers of Drakkenheim with the treacherous Rat Prince.

We crafted this as a short introductory module to not only showcase the eerie, dark fantasy of Drakkenheim using the new 2024 rules but also to serve as a gateway for new and returning players into the city's mystique.

Our aim is for players to tackle the challenging environment of Drakkenheim's ruins and for Dungeon Masters to feel empowered with all the tools necessary to facilitate a dynamic and player-driven adventure.</description>
