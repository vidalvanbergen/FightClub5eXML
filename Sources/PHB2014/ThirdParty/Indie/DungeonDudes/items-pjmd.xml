    <text>The toolkit provides everything characters need to extract animus and preserve any creature parts. This kit contains skinning knives, a cleaver, syringes, a hammer, scissors, scalpels, a bone saw, hooks, as well as vials, watertight containers, binding reagents, and wrappings.

Harvesting Components:

Characters may harvest and preserve Components from the corpse of a slain creature using monster harvesting tools.
    Harvesting monster components or extracting its animus must begin within ten minutes of its death. After this time, the magical energy within fades and the animus passes to the ether, and any remaining Components are no longer usable for creating magic items.
    No ability checks are required to successfully harvest monsters or extract an animus. As long as a character has the time and tools, they always successfully collect one monster Component from a creature's corpse. The toolkit provides everything a character needs to extract and preserve parts from any creature.

Monster Components:

When the characters decide to harvest a monster's corpse, the Game Master determines which Components can be harvested from a monster, if any. In this book, each monster entry lists the Components available from that creature. 

Component Rarity:

The rarity of all parts are determined by the CR of the monster as presented by the table earlier in this chapter. Most item recipes call for Components with the same rarity as the item itself. However, some recipes may call for a component from a specific named monster, such as a Frost Giant, an Ancient Red Dragon, or a Banshee. In such cases, if no part of the presented rarity is available for a monster of that type, the DM should allow a component of a lower rarity to be used. For example, the ghost site bow is a Very Rare item that requires the bones of a Dryad and the hair of a Banshee. In this case, these components require you to find any Dryad or Banshee and do not require the parts to be Very Rare.

Component Categories:

Each Component belongs to one of the following categories:

• Animus. This special Component is described below.
• Bones. This includes the skull, spine, or the stem of a plant monster.
• Dust. Detritus left behind by magical creatures or undead.
• Fluid. Usually monster blood, and also ectoplasm, sap, or mucus.
• Hair. Any fur or feathers.
• Hide. Includes the monster's skin, scales, carapace, bark, or plates.
• Natural Weapons. Almost any natural weapon from the monster's game statistics, such as teeth, claws, horns, tentacles, etc.
• Organs. A broad category including both internal body parts and sensory organs, such as the heart, brain, glands, eyes, or guts.

Magical Animus:

In the world of Drakkenheim, magic items are created by imbuing a physical object with a metaphysical animus. This vital energy must be properly extracted from a magical creature. A creature's animus is formed from the latent magical energy held within its body, but it is distinct from a creature's soul. Aberrations, Celestials, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, Giants, Monstrosities, Plants, Oozes, and Undead all possess a magical animus. Beasts and Humanoids typically do not possess an animus.
    When a creature is slain, its animus lingers momentarily before fading into the ether. However, a creature's animus can be collected and contained within a vessel of some kind, which is then used to make a magical item. It is impossible to extract the animus of a creature without killing it.
    Creating magic items requires the animus of one or more suitably powerful creatures. However, some magic items may call for a specific type of animus, such as the animus of a fey creature or dragon. In rare cases, a magic item may require the animus of a much more specific monster.
     Animus Vessels. An animus must be collected and stored in a specially prepared magical vessel. Traditionally, these vessels were minor magic items in their own right: often rune-etched gemstones infused with magic and created in a laborious process. However, the world of Drakkenheim was transformed by the arrival of delerium: the eldritch crystals function as suitable vessels in their raw state. A delerium crystal filled with magical animus glows with a brilliant octarine light, similar to how the crystals resonate with energy when exposed to magic.
    Creating Animus Vessels. An animus vessel can be created in 1 hour by combining any three other components of the same rarity. The resulting vessel can then be used as a vessel for an animus of the corresponding rarity. For example, an animus made from three Rare components can hold a Rare animus. 

Animus Vessel Crystal Sizes
Animus Rarity     | Required Delerium Crystal Size
Common     | Chip
Uncommon     | Fragment
Rare         | Shard
Very Rare     | Crystal
Legendary     | Geode

Harvest and Extraction Time.

Once started, collecting Components or animus takes ten minutes of work. During this time, the character must remain within 5 feet of the corpse. If the process is interrupted, harvesting must resume within ten minutes, or the Components are lost. A player character may only harvest Components from one creature at a time, regardless of its size. Several characters can work together to harvest multiple parts from the same corpse. No matter how many characters harvest a single corpse, they must all spend ten minutes harvesting.

Collector's Choice

Each character may harvest one component from a creature's corpse per encounter. Characters can work together to harvest several different parts from one monster, or they may split up and harvest parts from several creatures at once. A monster's body usually provides only one of each available part, so two characters harvesting parts from the same corpse must choose to collect different parts, unless the Game Master determines that the creature's unique physiology allows the collection of multiples of the same part. For example, a Game Master might allow both horns from a Minotaur to be harvested, but it would take the work of two characters to collect both. Other parts may be more abstract in quantity: it's enough to know that the characters collected a bag of dragon fangs or a vial of troll blood without worrying about a specific measurement.
    When the player characters decide to butcher a carcass for Components, the Game Master lists all the possible Components available from the body. Each character may then choose one Component to collect. All other Components are lost and unusable, either because they were damaged in battle, ruined in the harvesting process, or deemed of unsuitable quality for magic item crafting.

    <text>This purple potion glows dimly with octarine light. It swirls and sparkles in its small, stoppered bottle. 
    When you drink this potion, you regain expended spell slots. Roll 1d6. You choose spell slots to regain which have a combined level equal to or less than the result. None of the slots can be higher than level 5.
    For one hour after drinking Aqua Delerium, roll 1d20 each time you cast a spell of level 1 or higher. On a 1, you trigger a random Arcane Anomaly.
     If you consume more than one dose of aqua delerium before finishing a Long Rest, you take 1d12 Necrotic damage for each spell slot level regained from the second dose, and your Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until you finish a Long Rest. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.
    When a creature who cannot cast spells using spell slots drinks Aqua Delerium, it takes 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage and gains one level of Contamination.

Crafting. Creating Aqua Delerium requires a Rare Workshop and the following Rare Components:
• [Animus] Any Animus
• [Dust] Aberrant Dust
• [Fluid] Contaminated Ichor
• [Organ] Any Glands

    <text>This bright orange fluid is stored in a syringe and charged with arcane magic. You can use a Utilize action to administer the shot directly to the heart of yourself or another willing creature.
    You are protected against Contamination for six hours after receiving a dose of Aqua Expurgo. During this time, whenever you fail a saving throw against an effect which would cause you to gain one or more Contamination levels, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this ability three times, after which the effects of Aqua Expurgo expire.
    If the effects of Aqua Expurgo expire in this manner, you immediately take 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage and become Incapacitated for 1 minute while you violently retch corrupt bile. Your Hit Point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until you finish a Long Rest. You die if this effect reduces your Hit Point maximum to 0. The Necrotic damage can't be reduced or prevented by any means.

    While wearing these magic bracers you gain Resistance to Lightning damage and Immunity to the Shocked condition.
    These magic bracers have six charges, and regain all expended charges each day at dawn. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one charge from the bracers to deal an extra 3d6 Lightning damage to the target. A target which takes this damage has the Shocked condition until the start of your next turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    Each time you hit with an Unarmed Strike while attuned to these magic gauntlets they gain one charge. The gauntlets can have up to 10 charges. Any unexpended charges disappear when you take a Long Rest or roll Initiative.
    While the gauntlets have at least one charge, your Unarmed Strikes deal Lightning damage instead of its normal damage type.
    While the gauntlets have 5 or more charges, your Unarmed Strikes deal an additional 2d6 Lightning damage and push the target 10 feet away from you on a hit.
    You can expend 2 charges from the gauntlets to cast the Shield spell.
    You can expend 10 charges from the gauntlets to cast Destructive Wave or Wall of Force, using your monk's focus saving throw DC.

During the forging process, the blade is quenched in the spinal fluids of a Far Dweller to draw out extraplanar forces. The resulting metal has an octarine sheen that reflects possible worlds and other realities. The grip and crossguard are decorated with the barbs and leather of a Warp Marauder, and the pommel is set with a delerium crystal containing the eldritch essence of a Far Dweller that powers the weapon's magic.
    You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using this magic weapon.
    Once per turn when you score a Critical Hit or reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points using this weapon, immediately after the attack you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 120 feet you can see.
    Additionally, once per turn when you teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of another creature while wielding this weapon, you can make one weapon attack against that creature with this weapon as part of the same action or Bonus Action made to teleport.
    While holding the blade, you can use a Magic action to cast Dimension Door. Once you do, you must finish a Short or Long Rest before you can use this feature again. 
    Curse. You have Disadvantage on saving throws against any spell or other effect which would forcibly teleport you or send you to another plane of existence.

    <text>This otherworldly blade is made from starmetal steel; a potent alloy produced by combining iron with carbon extracted from the bones of powerful aberrant creatures. During the forging process, the blade is quenched in the spinal fluids of a Far Dweller to draw out extraplanar forces. The resulting metal has an octarine sheen that reflects possible worlds and other realities. The grip and crossguard are decorated with the barbs and leather of a Warp Marauder, and the pommel is set with a delerium crystal containing the eldritch essence of a Far Dweller that powers the weapon's magic.
    You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using this magic weapon.
    Once per turn when you score a Critical Hit or reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points using this weapon, immediately after the attack you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 120 feet you can see.
    Additionally, once per turn when you teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of another creature while wielding this weapon, you can make one weapon attack against that creature with this weapon as part of the same action or Bonus Action made to teleport.
    While holding the blade, you can use a Magic action to cast Dimension Door. Once you do, you must finish a Short or Long Rest before you can use this feature again. 
    Curse. You have Disadvantage on saving throws against any spell or other effect which would forcibly teleport you or send you to another plane of existence.
    
Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
    
Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Crafting. Creating a Sword Between Worlds requires a Very Rare Workshop and the following Very Rare Components:
• [Animus] Aberration Animus
• [Bones] Skull, Spine, or Ribs from an Aberration.
• [Fluid] Contaminated Ichor from a Far Dweller

Strung with the hair of a banshee with a powerful wraith animus is placed with-in the handle. Once the bow's crafting is complete, it fades from its physical form into a semi-corporeal form.
    You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic longbow.
    The bow produces its own spectral ammunition which deals Force damage instead of Piercing damage. The ammunition disappears when it hits or misses a target.
    While attuned to this weapon, you can use a Bonus Action to see into the Ethereal Plane and see all invisible creatures and objects until the end of your turn. Additionally, you can see through all walls and solid objects within 60 feet of you until the end of your turn. During this time, ammunition fired from this bow passes through solid objects, and you can target enemies within 60 feet of you with your ranged attacks, even if they are behind total cover. You can use this Bonus Action only if you haven't moved during your turn. After you use the Bonus Action, your Speed becomes 0 until the end of your turn.

Crafting. Creating a Ghost Sight Bow requires a Very Rare Workshop and the following Very Rare components:
• [Animus] Undead Animus from a Wraith
• [Bones] Skull from a Dryad

    <range>30/120</range>
    <text>This crossbow is covered in metal plating, decorative and refined pointed metal tips along an oak wood body, and foregrip. The barrel and limb are reinforced with the steel plates from a construct, with a stained leather grip made from a monster's hide. Its hair strung bowstring and leather fasteners hold a series of syringes in place. The crossbow's stock has a series of various tubes extruding from it that connect to an alchemical chamber on the side of the weapon. A mechanical wheel feeds the darts into place upon filling them, auto-loading the crossbow for easy firing.
    You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic crossbow. This crossbow ignores the Loading property, and you don't need a free hand to load a piece of ammunition into it.
    Once per turn when you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this crossbow, you can apply one of the following poisons. 
    Virulent. The target takes an extra 2d6 Poison damage.
    Weakening. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is Weakened until the start of your next turn.
    Immobilizing. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is Immobilized until the start of your next turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

    <text>These weapons are carved from bark, with a core of magical sap, and decorated with leaves from magical plants. Their hilts and shafts are bound in hair from a fey creature. This magic weapon channels the natural magic found in the elements of nature.
    While holding this magic weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your Ranger spells. In addition, you can use the weapon as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.
    When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can expend a Ranger spell slot to cast Hunter's Mark on the target as part of the same action used to make the attack. When you cast Hunter's Mark in this way it does not require Concentration. Additionally, the spell lasts for one minute or until the target dies or you cast Hunter's Mark again using either the weapon or otherwise.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Crafting. Creating a Monster Hunter's Weapon requires a Workshop and the following Components of rarity equal to the item's rarity:
• [Animus] Any Animus
• [Fluid] Sap
• [Hair] Hair from a Fey
• [Hair] Leaves
• [Hide] Bark

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    While holding this magic weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your Ranger spells. In addition, you can use the weapon as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.
    When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can expend a Ranger spell slot to cast Hunter's Mark on the target as part of the same action used to make the attack. When you cast Hunter's Mark in this way it does not require Concentration. Additionally, the spell lasts for one minute or until the target dies or you cast Hunter's Mark again using either the weapon or otherwise.

Special: When you make a melee attack with this weapon, you ignore its ammunition property. You can use the hoopak as a martial ranged weapon. If you do, it uses the ammunition property, uses sling bullets, and deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

    <text>These weapons are carved from bark, with a core of magical sap, and decorated with leaves from magical plants. Their hilts and shafts are bound in hair from a fey creature. This magic weapon channels the natural magic found in the elements of nature.
    While holding this magic weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your Ranger spells. In addition, you can use the weapon as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.
    When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can expend a Ranger spell slot to cast Hunter's Mark on the target as part of the same action used to make the attack. When you cast Hunter's Mark in this way it does not require Concentration. Additionally, the spell lasts for one minute or until the target dies or you cast Hunter's Mark again using either the weapon or otherwise.

Special: When you make a melee attack with this weapon, you ignore its ammunition property. You can use the hoopak as a martial ranged weapon. If you do, it uses the ammunition property, uses sling bullets, and deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Crafting. Creating a Monster Hunter's Weapon requires a Workshop and the following Components of rarity equal to the item's rarity:
• [Animus] Any Animus
• [Fluid] Sap
• [Hair] Hair from a Fey
• [Hair] Leaves
• [Hide] Bark

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>These weapons are carved from bark, with a core of magical sap, and decorated with leaves from magical plants. Their hilts and shafts are bound in hair from a fey creature. This magic weapon channels the natural magic found in the elements of nature.
    While holding this magic weapon, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your Ranger spells. In addition, you can use the weapon as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.
    When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can expend a Ranger spell slot to cast Hunter's Mark on the target as part of the same action used to make the attack. When you cast Hunter's Mark in this way it does not require Concentration. Additionally, the spell lasts for one minute or until the target dies or you cast Hunter's Mark again using either the weapon or otherwise.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

    When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can expend a Ranger spell slot to cast Hunter's Mark on the target as part of the same action used to make the attack. When you cast Hunter's Mark in this way it does not require Concentration. Additionally, the spell lasts for one minute or until the target dies or you cast Hunter's Mark again using either the weapon or otherwise.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    While holding this magic weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your Ranger spells. In addition, you can use the weapon as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.
    When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can expend a Ranger spell slot to cast Hunter's Mark on the target as part of the same action used to make the attack. When you cast Hunter's Mark in this way it does not require Concentration. Additionally, the spell lasts for one minute or until the target dies or you cast Hunter's Mark again using either the weapon or otherwise.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
    If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
