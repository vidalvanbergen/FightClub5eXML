      <name>Apothecary</name>
      <text>A bespectacled man stands at an operating table, studying the dissected monstrosity resting upon the slab. The crackle of electric conductors harmonize with his arcane mumblings as he takes up his scalpels and saws. As he finishes the final stitch, the creature's hand twitches and jolts to life once more.

Cloaked in an acid-stained heavy coat, a tall half-elf brews tinctures and tonics. Her face is concealed behind thick black goggles and a heavy breathing mask as she performs an unusual combination of herbalism, alchemy, medicine, and magic. Her mixtures bubble and boil as she muses whether the cure will be worse than the disease.

A lithe tiefling soothes a suffering patient as they draw a sample of contaminated blood. Lifting the vial to examine the liquid within, they pull upon eldritch energy to distill the sample into a pure contagion. Scribbling their findings down in a withered notebook, they add the vial to their collection of pathogens and scourges to use against their foes.

      <name>Medical Experts</name>
      <text>An apothecary is a practiced medical expert and arcane magic user. They wield their knowledge to both heal and harm, augmenting their conventional skills with alchemy and occult magic. Some apothecaries might first attempt treatment with traditional means like medicinal herbs and surgical techniques. When these mundane methods are not enough, they use arcane magic and eldritch forces to restore their patients. An apothecary's unique skills prove useful whether their patients suffer from natural or supernatural ailments, but apothecaries possess knowledge of the body which can be used for more than just healing. Their arcane methods can strengthen, transform, or protect their allies, and some apothecaries know deadly techniques which can harm and kill their enemies. An apothecary understands how the difference between a poison and a cure lies often only in the dose.
	Their careful study of life and death gives an apothecary the tools to both help allies survive horrible ailments, injuries, and pluck them from the clutches of death, or use their enemies as test subjects for their dangerous compounds, terrible diseases and poisonous magic.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Knowledge Seekers</name>
      <text>Most apothecaries set out with the goal of furthering their studies and expanding their magical horizons, uncovering new ways to wield magic for dangerous or life-saving effects, and learning forbidden knowledge kept from the rest of the world. They believe that knowledge is power, and see themselves as seekers of knowledge. Some kinder apothecaries see their duty as protectors of the innocent, dedicating their lives to helping sick and injured people. Others see every opportunity to exploit the weak and push their search for true power forward. Many fall somewhere in between, riding the lines of mad scientist and renowned doctor.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Occult Practicioners</name>
      <text>Apothecaries seek out occult lore and use it to study and practice scientific theories. Many of their magical incantations, whether it be for the purposes of saving lives, or ending them, are deemed experimental. Many apothecaries keep a notebook close at hand and write down esoteric theories based on their findings and field work.
	Apothecaries are gaining renown within some remote communities on the continent as doctors and healers to whom one can turn to instead of religious figures. However, they are more often viewed as dangerous scientists and mysterious witches who use magic to create toxins and poisons that could eradicate entire armies.</text>

      <name>Creating an Apothecary</name>
      <text>When you set out to create an apothecary, the most important question is to decide your path of study. What is it that drives you to seek knowledge? Are you working in the service of good? Is your life dedicated to helping those in need? By studying poisons, diseases, occult lore, and forbidden knowledge, do you hope to help the sick and wounded? Perhaps you aim to save someone you care about, or protect your kingdom or homeland from the evils of this world. Or maybe your studies are more dangerous in nature. Do you set out on adventure to test your dangerous chemical formulae? Do you see each monster or enemy as a test subject for your concoctions and spells?
	All apothecaries share a search for knowledge, and dabble in forbidden lore and occult practices. Although many in their practice are happy to sell their services or potions in cities or to well-paying nobles and kings, some are called to adventure, setting out on the endless hunt for knowledge. Others work as investigators and researchers. Many apothecaries see adventure as a means to perform direct field research, perfect their skills, and test the true potential of their theories.

Quick Build:
You can make an apothecary quickly by following these suggestions.
	• First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.
	• Second, choose your character ancestry and background.
	• Third, choose the poison needle and spare the dying cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells envenom and healing word.

Personality Traits:
1. I often use big scientific words; | just can't help but to embellish my superior intellect.
2. I have a dark sense of humor. Often my jokes fall flat on those who do not share in my macabre ideals.
3. I mutter to myself constantly. Years in the lab have meant that I am accustomed to speaking mostly to myself.

Ideals:
1. Science. To push the boundaries of mortal capabilities is a reason to live, and a worthy legacy to leave behind.
2. Education. If I can share the great secrets | learn with others, the world will be better for it.
3. Power. Mageborn think they hold all the cards, but the power we can unlock through occult practice and advanced study will surpass any silly fireball-throwing mage.

Bonds:
1. I was laughed at for my passion for study. I want to prove to the world how great science can be.
2. There are secrets of this world capable of unlocking vast mortal potential - I will discover them.
3. My mentor was a great genius. I want to finish the work they started.

Flaws:
1. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices to prove a hypothesis. Sometimes those sacrifices are people's lives. A worthy cost for
science, no?
2. I obsess over my theories and discovering occult lore; occasionally it is all consuming.
3. I scoff at mages and their petty parlor tricks. They cannot fathom the power we can wield if we simply seek it.

Personal Quest:
1. I must collect blood samples of the five chromatic dragons in order to perfect the ultimate concoction.
2. I will be the first non-mageborn to prove the potential of scientific study and join the Amethyst Academy elite.
3. The falling star that struck Drakkenheim is sure to have unfathomable potential for my study. I must collect a shard from the source in the heart of the crater.</text>

        <name>Multiclass Apothecary</name>
        <text>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose Apothecary as one of your classes.

Ability Score Minimum:
As a multiclass character, you must have at least the following ability score(s) to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an apothecary.

	• Intelligence 13

Proficiencies Gained:
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of your new class's starting proficiencies, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a barbarian.

	• Armor: light armor
	• Weapons: none
	• Tools: one of your choice

Esoteric Theories:
Meeting the prerequisites for Esoteric Theories is based on total apothecary levels, not the overall character level. In addition, the Surgical Strikes esoteric theory does not give you additional attacks if you have the Extra Attack class feature.

      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Apothecary Magic</name>
        <text>Your arcane research has given you facility with spells. Refer to the Core Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing in this book for the apothecary spell list.

Formula Book:
You have a book or collection of notes that you study to prepare your apothecary spells, develop your esoteric theories, and record your occult practices. You may use your formula book as an arcane focus for your apothecary spells. You may describe this book any way you like. Some examples of your book's appearance include:

	 • A large leatherbound tome with yellowing pages bound shut with an iron lock

	•  A scattered assortment of scribbled notes loosely held together by rope

	• A pristine journal with perfect edges and beautiful penmanship

	• A leather briefcase with two small golden locks

	• A medical bag with surgical symbols on the sides

	• A beat-up satchel slung over one shoulder with vials and bottles poking out of every pocket

If the book is destroyed or lost, you can recreate it using inks and paper during a long rest.

Cantrips. You know three cantrips of your choice from the apothecary spell list. You learn additional apothecary cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Apothecary table.

Elementary Reformulation:
Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one apothecary cantrip you know with another cantrip from the apothecary spell list.

Preparing and Casting Spells:
The Apothecary table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your apothecary spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your apothecary spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. 
	You prepare the list of apothecary spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the apothecary spell list. When you do so, choose a number of apothecary spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your apothecary level (minimum of one spell). A spell you prepare must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Apothecary table's Slot Level column for your level.
	For example, if you are a 5th-level apothecary, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, in any combination. To cast the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of apothecary spells requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your apothecary spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and occult knowledge. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an apothecary spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Ritual Casting. You can cast an apothecary spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

Spellcasting Focus. You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section of the Core Rules) as a spellcasting focus for your apothecary spells.

        <text>As a bonus action, you may expend a spell slot to undergo a grotesque transformation. The transformation ends after one minute, or if you are reduced to 0 hit points or incapacitated. When you undergo this transformation you maintain your personality, alignment, and game statistics. However, several changes occur:

	• Your Strength and Intelligence ability scores are swapped.

	• Your size becomes Large, your jump distance is doubled, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

	• Each of your hands transform into a big meaty fist, which you can use to make melee weapon attacks. It counts as a simple weapon for you. Your big meaty fists deal 1d10 + your Strength modifier + your Apothecary level bludgeoning damage on a hit.

	• You cannot cast or concentrate on spells.

	• You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

	• You gain temporary hit points equal to five times your Apothecary level.

You also amplify your abilities based on the potency of your concoction. This is related to the spell slot you used to undergo the transformation:

	• Your speed increases by 5 feet per level of spell slot used.

	• Your AC is 13 + the level of spell slot used.

	• At the start of each of your turns and as long as you have at least 1 hit point remaining, you regain a number of hit points equal to the level of the spell slot used.

	• Draconic Genome. You grow fleshy wings from your back and your skin takes on a scaly appearance. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and as an action can spew bile in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 8d6 acid damage, or half as much on a successful save. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

	• Giant Genome. You become a hulking mass of flesh and muscle, turning yourself into a living siege weapon. Your size becomes Huge and all damage dealt to objects and structures is now doubled. As an action, you can expend a spell slot on your turn to slam your fists into the ground, sending shockwaves and rubble crashing around you. All creatures in a 30-foot radius centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or they take 8d6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. If they succeed on the saving throw, they take half damage and are not knocked prone.

	• Cerebellum Genome. You maintain a fraction of your mind as you transform, allowing remnants of your studies to linger in your monstrous brain. You now have the ability to maintain concentration on spells while in your transmogrified form. While transmogrified, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed check, the creature's spell, trait, or feature fails and has no effect.

Mutant Strains Known:
Apothecary Level | Number of Strains

Whenever you cast a spell which inflicts diseases (such as infect* or contagion) you can apply an additional effect from your mutant strain to one of the targets of the spell, which lasts for the duration of that spell.
	The following mutant strains are available to you when you learn a mutant strain. If a strain has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the strain.

	• Dizziness. The target can't take reactions.

	• Fatigue. Each time the target fails a saving throw against your disease, its speed is reduced to five feet until the start of its next turn.

	• Coughing Fits. At the start of each of the targets' turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it is unable to speak until the start of its next turn.

	• Shivers. The target shakes uncontrollably. At the start of each of the target's turns, it drops whatever it is holding in its hands.

	• Weakness (9th level). The target deals half damage with melee weapon attacks.

	• Dry Eyes (9th level). Each time the target fails a saving throw against your disease, it becomes blinded until the start of its next turn.

	• Intense Fever (9th level). The target can't regain hit points.

	• Lesions (9th level). The target loses any damage resistances.

	• Nausea (15th level). Each time a target fails a saving throw against your disease, it becomes incapacitated until the start of its next turn.

	• Dystrophy (15th level). The target becomes vulnerable to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

See its game statistics in the accompanying Corpsewrought Creature stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the creature; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.
	In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the creature can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. If your corpsewrought creature has died within the last hour, you can use your healer's kit as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend an apothecary spell slot. The corpsewrought companion returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.
