        <text>Delerium is naturally drawn to magic and can twist and augment its presence in unnatural and unpredictable ways. Some who ventured into the ruins of Drakkenheim are twisted by the eldritch powers and emerge infused with contaminated energies. They become a living vessel for the Arcane Anomalies and twisting realities found within the ruins.

        <name>Delerium Spells (Delerium Soul (HB))</name>
        <text>Imbued with the eldritch power of delerium, your magic is fundamentally contaminated. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Delerium Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells
you know.
	Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a contaminated spell.

Delerium spells:
Sorcerer Level | Spell
1st | comet shards*, faerie fire
3rd | controlled mutation*, grasping ghost*
5th | vanish to the space between worlds*, weave the elder sign*
7th | siphon time*, summon delerium elemental*
9th | contaminated hand*, wall of force

        <name>Mutant Manifestation (Delerium Soul (HB))</name>
        <text>When you finish a long rest, you can choose to roll twice on the Mutations table, and must select one of the results. You gain that mutation, which remains until you finish a long rest, even if you don't currently have any contamination levels.

Mutations Table:
d20 | Mutation
1 | Rampant Mutation. Roll twice, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
2 | Rasping. Your vocal cords warp. You can only speak in a halting gurgle. If you have 4 or more Contamination Levels, your tongue rots and falls out, and you can no longer speak.
3 | Wasting. Your fingernails, teeth, and toenails start falling out. 2d6 fall out for each Contamination Level you have gained.
4 | Rotting. Your lips, nose, and ears blacken and wither. If you reach 4 or more Contamination Levels, they rot and fall off. You can still speak and hear, however.
5 | Molting. Painful blisters, welts, and multicolored lesions appear all over your skin, which burst and peel off painfully, exposing the raw sinew underneath. Once you reach 4 Contamination Levels, your skin entirely sloughs off.
6 | Shedding. Each time you gain a contamination level, some of your hair falls out in patches. Once you reach 4 or more Contamination Levels, all hair on your body completely falls out.
7 | Lambent Glow. You emit a dim octarine glow to a range of 10 feet. If you have 4 or more Contamination Levels, you instead emit bright light to a range of 30 feet.
8 | Ocular Tumors. An eyeball opens somewhere on your body for each Contamination Level you have gained. If you have 4 or more Contamination Levels, you can see in all directions.
9 | Spiked Growths. At the start of each of your turns, you deal 5 (1d10) piercing damage to any creature you are grappling.
10 | Aquatic Adaptation. You sprout fish-like fins and gills. You gain a swimming speed equal to your land speed and can breathe underwater. If you have 4 or more Contamination Levels, you can only breathe underwater; but can hold your breath outside water for up to 1 hour.
11 | Amorphous Form. Your bones and organs become gelatinous. You can move through a space as narrow as 6 inches wide without squeezing.
12 | Chitinous Skin. Shell-like growths appear all over your body, giving you a ti bonus to AC. If you have four or more Contamination Levels, this bonus increases to +2.
13 | Cyclopean Vision. Your eyes merge into a single central eye which can emit an energy beam as a ranged spell attack using your Intelligence modifier. If it hits, it deals 2d6 radiant damage.
14 | Spatial Displacement. You can cast misty step once for each Contamination Level you have gained. You regain these uses when you finish a long rest.
15 | Tentacled Limb. One of your arms becomes a fleshy tentacle. When you make a melee attack on your turn, increase your reach by 5 feet.
16 | Spider Climb. You gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed. You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
17 | Whispering Voices. You gain telepathy to a range of 10 feet, but other people hear it as their own voice. If you have 4 or more Contamination Levels, the range extends to 60 feet.
18 | Belly Maw. A toothy mouth appears on your stomach, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
19 | Eyeless Sight. Your eyes become milky orbs, and you gain blindsight to a range of 10 feet. If you have 4 or more Contamination Levels, your eyes rot out, and dim octarine light burns in the sockets. Your blindsight increases to 30 feet, but you are blind beyond this radius.
20 | Arcane Blood. You gain an additional spell slot of the highest level you can cast (to a maximum of 5th level). If you don't have spell slots, your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your level. If you have four or more Contamination Levels, you gain two spell slots instead of one or increase your hit points by twice your level.

        <name>Contaminated Sorcery (Delerium Soul (HB))</name>
        <text>When you cast a contaminated spell, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, you don't gain a Contamination Level by casting the spell, and if the spell requires delerium as a material component, it is not consumed by the spell. In addition, casting a contaminated spell in this manner immediately causes an Arcane Anomaly.

Arcane Anomalies:
d20 | Arcane Anomaly
1 | Gravity breaks within a 100-foot-radius area for 1 hour. Creatures levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.
2 | The nearest creature is affected by hideous laughter (spell save DC 15) but instead of laughing, the creature repeats unfathomable combinations of syllables and words. Occasionally, a somewhat comprehensible but totally illogical phrase emerges, such as "... oh time thy pyramids!"
3 | Time skips a beat. Creatures within 60 feet experience a palpable and are stunned for round (no saving throw).
4 | The nearest creature becomes unstuck in time. It is affected by the blink spell for 1 minute. Instead of vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, the creature vanishes into a sliver of time in its past or possible future.
5 | A prismatic burst of energy erupts in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 radiant damage and become blinded for 1 round. The smell of ozone fills the area, and nearby wood and inanimate plants are transformed into solid glass.
6 | Echoes of possible realities are briefly visible for 1 minute. When a creature within 60 feet is hit by an attack, a faint vision of the creature being killed by that attack appears.
7 | Discordant music fills the mind of all creatures within 30 feet, who are affected as if by irresistible dance (spell save DC 15)
8 | A section of stone, water, air, or energy becomes an appropriate delerium elemental.
9 | An extraplanar creature is summoned. The Game Master either chooses the creature or determines it randomly. It is friendly to the creature who triggered the anomaly.
10 | All humanoid corpses within 120 feet animate as hostile zombies. The shrieking undead beg frantically for forgiveness as they rip apart the living.
11 | The shadows of 1d6 random creatures in the area animate and try to kill them while softly whispering "Guilty, guilty, guilty...". Once destroyed, the creatures don't cast a shadow for 24 hours.
12 | All creatures within 60 feet become invisible for 1 minute or until they attack or cast a spell.
13 | Tendrils of life flow from the nearest creature to others. The targets must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 necrotic damage, or half as much on a success. The three nearest creatures within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to the damage taken.
14 | A hypnotic pattern (spell save DC 15) appears. It creates scintillating impossible colors in shapes which are simply wrong. Creatures incapacitated by the spell weep uncontrollably for the duration.
15 | A black tentacles spell appears in the area for 1 hour (escape DC 15).
16 | Objects within 60 feet come to life for the next hour, as if affected by the animate objects spell. They mumble awful truths, but are not otherwise hostile.
17 | The nearest creature is polymorphed into an awakened shrub for 1 hour or until reduced to 0 hp.
18 | Time slows down for up to six randomly determined creatures within 120 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the slow spell for 1 minute. (spell save DC 15).
19 | Time speeds up for one randomly determined creature within 60 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the haste spell for 1 minute.
20 | A bowl of flowers and a very surprised aquatic mammal appear 100 feet in the air. "Oh no, not again..." thinks the flowers.

        <text>You can tap into contaminated energy to cast a spell you do not know. You can cast any spell from any class spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and you must expend a spell slot as normal. Casting the spell uses the spell's normal casting time, and if the spell has material components, you must provide those components as normal. As part of casting the spell, but before the spell takes effect, you gain a number of Contamination Levels equal to half the spell's level, rounded down (minimum of one). You can't prevent or reduce these Contamination Levels by any means, but you can remove them as normal.
