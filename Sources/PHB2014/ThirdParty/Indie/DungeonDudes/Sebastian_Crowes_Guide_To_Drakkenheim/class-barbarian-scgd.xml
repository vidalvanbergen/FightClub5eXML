        <name>Primal Path: Path of the Haze Rager (HB)</name>
        <text>The first warriors who ventured into Drakkenheim were doomed. Few returned from these early expeditions, and those few who survived were forever changed by the experience. A rare few wrestle the madness of the Haze through a supernatural rage which allows them to channel the eldritch energies of delerium. These Haze Ragers thrive on the contaminated power of delerium, transforming madness and fear into a weapon. Their practice has given them unnatural tolerance for contamination, and some have told legends of these barbarians surviving even the most horrific mutations.

        <name>Contaminated Fury (Path of the Haze Rager (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel contaminated fury into your weapon strikes. Once per turn while you are raging, you can deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to a target you hit with one of your weapon attacks unarmed strikes. This extra damage increases at 2d8 when you reach 10th level, and to 3d8 when you reach 14th level.
	In addition, you can draw contamination into yourself to empower your melee weapon attacks further. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can choose to give yourself one or more levels of contamination to deal necrotic damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for each level of contamination you choose to gain.

In addition, if the spell would normally cause you to gain exhaustion, you don't gain exhaustion from the spell.

Mists swirl about you in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you, which moves with you. The area within the mists is lightly obscured. Creatures who begin their turn in the mists must make an Intelligence saving throw. The save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. A creature who fails this saving throw takes 3d8 psychic damage and has its speed halved. Additionally, they cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn. When you manifest the mists, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected.
