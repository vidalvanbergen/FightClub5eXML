    <description>This horrific thing has no shape or body resembling anything from the Mortal World. It roughly resembles a tree stump with four root-like legs each ending in a misshapen hoof. It has a wet, mottled, bark-like hide, and sprouting from the side of it like branches are knobbly arms ending in sharp claws. The top of its body is a gaping, tooth-filled mouth. It is shovelling chunks of horse-flesh into itself, and giggling as it swallows the ripped flesh. Whatever passes for arms, on the inside of the palm are yellow eyes.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine an Agog, learning the following based on the result.
(5+) Climbing Aberration. You know the creature's type, and movement speeds. 
(10+) Attack the Fallen. You are aware of the creature's Gobble Bonus Action. 
(15+) Dim but Sturdy. You recognize the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.  

Combat Tactics
The Agog barrels towards its enemies, flailing its arms towards them and attempting to grab them and toss them to the ground. If it knocks a creature down, it will immediately begin attempting to devour them.

    <description>This creature has gaunt and misshapen form, with the scaled body, tail, and head of an alligator, bony spokes covering its body like a porcupine, batlike wings, and long, spindly limbs.

Study the Foe
Characters proficient in History or Nature gain Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when they take the Study action to examine an Allopine, learning the following based on the result.
(5+) Flying Aberration. You know the creature's type, and movement speeds. 
(10+) Shifty. You are aware of the creature's Nimble Escape Bonus Action. 
(15+) Agile but Meek. They learn the creature's highest and lowest ability scores.  

Combat Tactics
Allopines are not warriors, but they are hostile to creatures who enter their territory and will fire Quills at anyone who comes too close. They do not stick around in a fight by themselves, and if they are with a flock, they will prefer to take to the air and fire Quills from afar.
