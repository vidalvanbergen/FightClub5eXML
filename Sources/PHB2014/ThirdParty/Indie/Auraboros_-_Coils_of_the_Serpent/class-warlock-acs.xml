        <text>Your patron gifts you with a magical needle and ink, allowing you to scribe spells on yourself in the form of tattoos.
	Once per long rest, you can scribe one of your known spells onto your skin, using the magical ink and needle. These skin etchings glow with faint, sickly green light. Once the spell is scribed, you are free to cast it without consuming a spell slot as a bonus action, but the tattoo is consumed. You cannot cast another spell in the same round that you use this bonus action.
	Scribing yourself with a tattoo takes 30 minutes. You can only have one spell scribed onto your skin at a time.

        <text>Warlocks in Lawbrand are granted their power by Karybdiss, The Souleater—a hydra-
like beast that is sustained by the souls of the living. These twisted magic users can
warp the minds of others with their aura and harness Karybdiss' power to absorb souls
themselves. This not without faults, however. Carrying another being's soul can be a
terrible burden on oneself, but the power afforded by it is immeasurable.

        <name>Terrifying Aura (Souleater (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you may emanate an air of psychic terror in a 15 ft. radius. When a hostile creature comes within range of your aura, they must make a Wisdom saving throw equal to your Spellcasting DC. Each creature can only be affected by this ability once every 10 minutes and the aura lasts for 1 minute.

Terrifying Aura:
d8 | Aura Effect
1 | The character loses attention as their mind seems to skip for a moment, causing their next attack to have disadvantage.
2 | A crippling dread washes over the creature, and they are struck speechless for their next action.
3 | The creature is terrified at the mere sight of you. They must use their movement to move as far away from you as possible on their next turn.
4 | The creature feels nauseous, its movement speed is reduced to 0 until the end of it's turn. 
5 | The creature is overcome with rage and must use their next attack on the nearest creature.
6 | Horrific thoughts flood the target's mind. They have disadvantage on saving throws until the end of their next turn.
7 | The creature cowers in fear, immediately dropping their weapon.
8 | The creature is stunned until the start of its next turn.

        <name>Hallucinatory Magic (Souleater (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 1st level, when you cast a spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to cast the spell subtly into the mind of your target, causing the casting of the spell and its effects to only be visible to the target. If the spell deals damage, it deals an additional 1d4 psychic damage. You can do this a number of times per long rest equal to your Charisma modifier.

        <name>Soul Shackle (Souleater (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, as a reaction, you can use an eldritch tether to chain the soul of a recently killed creature within 5 ft. to yourself. This creature must have an Intelligence of 3 or higher and have been killed within the last 10 minutes. You are able to store a number of souls equal to your warlock level. While you are storing these souls, the essence of Karybdiss gnaws away at your existence, preventing you from sleeping while taking a long rest. This causes your long rest to only restore your spell slots and hit points, and prevents any exhaustion level reduction. Additionally, you must take a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid increasing your exhaustion level by 1. This saving throw's DC increases by 1 for each day that the Warlock makes the save.
	You can then "devour" these bound souls to produce a variety of effects:

	• Devour 2 souls to cast a known cantrip as a bonus action (cannot be used if you cast another cantrip this turn).
	• Devour 5 souls as a bonus action to reduce your exhaustion level by 1.
	• Devour 6 souls as a bonus action to regain a spell slot.
	• Devour 10 souls as a bonus action to regain the use of an arcanum.

        <text>At 10th level, your connection to Karybdiss grows even stronger, and you are flooded with the great Souleater's profane power. You can cast the following spells as an action by gaining a level of exhaustion:

	• Dimension Door
	• Mass Cure Wounds
	• Sending

        <name>Sacrifice Soul (Souleater (HB))</name>
        <text>At 14th level, once per short rest, you may force a target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC. If your target is already charmed by you, they have disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failure, they become paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. If the creature remains paralyzed at the end of their fifth turn, Karybdiss consumes their soul, killing them instantly.
