    <description>These priests often direct the Children's warriors in battle—and can wield the light of the sun to strike at unbelievers and blind them with righteous truth

Ash'Ahand:
Trained as battle priests who wield the devastating powers of the sun, the Ash'ahand serve as both the spiritual leaders and most ardent defenders of the Children of the Sun. Their zealotry and fiery devotion are inspirational to their followers but terrifying to all enemies of the faith. The Ash'ahand can channel the sun's fury by hurling gouts of fire, creating whirling shields of flame and calling down fiery blasts from the heavens. They are the wrath of the sun personified— and are committed to burning down the old world and trampling upon its ashes...

    <description>These lightly armed scouts rely on speed and stealth to survey the seas. Though they are deadly with a blade, they will often disengage when confronted by overwhelming numbers.

Daggermaw:
The savage atsaadi warriors of the L'hale clan are known to their enemies as the Daggermaw. They resent Lawbrand's encroachments on their territorial waters, and anything perceived as a threat to their culture and freedom is met with extreme violence. The Daggermaw are feared for the speed and ferocity of their coastal raids—they sow terror and ruin among land dwellers and then retreat back to the waves before a defense can be mustered. Yet these atsaad are just as deadly on the open sea as they are on land. Many a ship has succumbed to Daggermaw raiders who silently emerge from the depths, clamber up the vessels, and slaughter every crew member in sight. Though Lawbrand's authorities have heard stories of these attacks at sea, evidence is hard to come by on account of the Daggermaw's tactics: after killing a ship's crew and stealing its resources, they set the vessels alight and then dive back into the sea.

Infernal Powers:
d12 | Save | Effect
1 | WIS | The Legion Stirs: The Deathseer assails the target's mind, distracting it momentarily. A creature controlled by the Deathseer within 5 ft. of the target may immediately attack it. On a failed save, this attack is made with advantage.
2 | WIS | Bestow Curse: On a failed save, the target is cursed for the next minute. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against the Deathseer, must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or waste its action doing nothing, takes an additional 1d8 damage any time the Deathseer deals damage to it, and loses and additional 2d6 health from the Deathseer's Life Drink ability. A remove curse spell ends this effect.
3 | CON | Flesh Rot: On a successful save, the target is vulnerable to all damage for the next hour. Any effect that removes a disease also removes this effect.
4 | WIS |  Eyebite (Sleep): On a failed save, the target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake it awake.
5 | WIS | Eyebite (Panicked): On a failed save, the target is frightened of the Deathseer. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from the Deathseer by the safest and shortest route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 ft. from the Deathseer and can no longer see the Deathseer, this effect ends.
6 | WIS | Eyebite (Sickened): On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends.
7 | CON | Harm: On a failed save, the target must make a Constitution save or take 53 (14d6) necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful save. This damage cannot reduce the target below 1HP. Additionally, on a failed save, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage it took from this spell for 1 hour. Any effect that removes a disease also removes the hit point reduction from this spell.
8 | CON | Negative Energy Flood: On a failed save, the target takes 33 (5d12) necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful save. A target killed by this damage is raised as a zombie at the start of the Deathseer's next turn, and follows the Deathseer's orders.
9 | DEX | Enervation: On a failed save, the target takes 23 (5d8) necrotic damage, or half on a successful save. In addition, if the creature failed its save, for the next minute, the Deathseer can use its action to deal an additional 23 (5d8) damage to the target. If the Deathseer uses its action to do anything else, the target moves more than 60 ft. from the Deathseer, or its target has total cover from the Deathseer, this effect ends early.
10 | CHA | Vampiric Stare: On a failed save, the target takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, or half on a successful save, and the Deathseer regains hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
11 | CON | Drain Strength: On a failed save, the target deals half damage with all attacks and spells for the next minute. If the target deals damage to a creature other than the Deathseer while suffering from this effect, the Deathseer regains hit points equal to half the amount of damage dealt.
12 | CHA | Possession: On a failed save, the Deathseer controls the target and dictates what it does on its turn. A possessed creature must make a Charisma save at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this effect ends. If the Deathseer takes damage while this effect is ongoing, it must make a Concentration check, and the effect ends if it fails.</text>

    <description>The Magi are the most gifted Deathseer spellcasters—and the most evil and depraved. They exist only to break mortal minds and turn innocents into their murderous puppets.

Deathseer:
The Deathseers are hideous demons—floating balls of flesh with a single eye framed by a slavering mouth of fangs. Myriad tentacles hang from their bodies, each one acting as a tether to extra dimensional energies. This connection to raw magic is what makes the Deathseers extraordinary spellcasters—able to break minds and manipulate reality. These creatures have lurked in the shadows throughout Drastnia's history. They are driven by an instinctual desire to enslave all mortal beings to their will. Though their power is great, the Deathseers prefer to stay in hiding, using the minions in their thrall to enact their will in the world.

While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against the Deathseer, must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or waste its action doing nothing, takes an additional 1d8 damage any time the Deathseer deals damage to it, and loses and additional 2d6 health from the Deathseer's Life Drink ability. A remove curse spell ends this effect.
3 - CON - Flesh Rot: On a successful save, the target is vulnerable to all damage for the next hour. Any effect that removes a disease also removes this effect.
4 - WIS -  Eyebite (Sleep): On a failed save, the target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake it awake.
5 - WIS - Eyebite (Panicked): On a failed save, the target is frightened of the Deathseer. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from the Deathseer by the safest and shortest route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 ft. from the Deathseer and can no longer see the Deathseer, this effect ends.
6 - WIS - Eyebite (Sickened): On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends.
7 - CON - Harm: On a failed save, the target must make a Constitution save or take 53 (14d6) necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful save. This damage cannot reduce the target below 1HP. Additionally, on a failed save, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage it took from this spell for 1 hour. Any effect that removes a disease also removes the hit point reduction from this spell.
8 - CON - Negative Energy Flood: On a failed save, the target takes 33 (5d12) necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful save. A target killed by this damage is raised as a zombie at the start of the Deathseer's next turn, and follows the Deathseer's orders.
9 - DEX - Enervation: On a failed save, the target takes 23 (5d8) necrotic damage, or half on a successful save. In addition, if the creature failed its save, for the next minute, the Deathseer can use its action to deal an additional 23 (5d8) damage to the target. If the Deathseer uses its action to do anything else, the target moves more than 60 ft. from the Deathseer, or its target has total cover from the Deathseer, this effect ends early.
10 - CHA - Vampiric Stare: On a failed save, the target takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, or half on a successful save, and the Deathseer regains hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
11 - CON - Drain Strength: On a failed save, the target deals half damage with all attacks and spells for the next minute. If the target deals damage to a creature other than the Deathseer while suffering from this effect, the Deathseer regains hit points equal to half the amount of damage dealt.
12 - CHA - Possession: On a failed save, the Deathseer controls the target and dictates what it does on its turn. A possessed creature must make a Charisma save at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this effect ends. If the Deathseer takes damage while this effect is ongoing, it must make a Concentration check, and the effect ends if it fails.</text>

    <description>Able to call forth devilish creatures from the infernal realms beyond the waking world, the Summoners are obsessed with sowing chaos in the world and transforming it into a living hell.

Deathseer:
The Deathseers are hideous demons—floating balls of flesh with a single eye framed by a slavering mouth of fangs. Myriad tentacles hang from their bodies, each one acting as a tether to extra dimensional energies. This connection to raw magic is what makes the Deathseers extraordinary spellcasters—able to break minds and manipulate reality. These creatures have lurked in the shadows throughout Drastnia's history. They are driven by an instinctual desire to enslave all mortal beings to their will. Though their power is great, the Deathseers prefer to stay in hiding, using the minions in their thrall to enact their will in the world.

    <description>These crab-like creatures lurk beneath the sands of the Tanaroch Desert, slowly burrowing their way through the earth in search of prey and water sources. Due to their immense size, the Dunebacks hibernate underground for months or even years at a time. During these long slumbers, verdant oases grow atop the massive shells on their backs—welcome sights for weary travelers. Yet seasoned caravan leaders know to tread cautiously around these lush outcroppings. Dunebacks are fiercely territorial. When something they perceive as a threat draws near, they will explode from the earth in a shower of sand and rip apart their unsuspecting prey with razor-sharp mandibles and colossal pincer claws.

Most of these apparitions were originally conjured by cultists in the Fangs of Scyllia cult. Yet more recently, new fangwraiths have materialized all over Lawbrand due to unknown circumstances...

Fleshreaver:
Many different races have been afflicted by the demigod Ralavak's curse and transformed into Fleshreavers. These tragic creatures undergo horrific mutations, causing horns, bone spurs, and fangs to sprout from their shattered flesh. No two Fleshreavers change in the same way, but their facial features all warp into bestial goatlike visages. As the front line troops of the Howling's bloodthirsty armies, they mindlessly raid and destroy everything in sight.

    <description>Hired by wealthy clients to transport communiques, contraband, and other goods, the Couriers pride themselves on their speed, reliability, and discretion.

Gangrunner:
Many groups of centaur bandits terrorize the lawless wilds between the Trade-Cities. Collectively, they are known as gangrunners. Using their natural speed and physical strength, they rob and brutalize anyone who crosses their path—they live for the sheer joy of thievery and violence. Though most of the gangrunners prey upon convoys and travelers for sport, some of the brigands act as couriers or hired muscle for well-paying patrons in the Trade-Cities.

    <description>The true terrors of the Lawbrand's roadways, marauders are wild and fearsome melee fighters who revel in cracking skulls.

Gangrunner:
Many groups of centaur bandits terrorize the lawless wilds between the Trade-Cities. Collectively, they are known as gangrunners. Using their natural speed and physical strength, they rob and brutalize anyone who crosses their path—they live for the sheer joy of thievery and violence. Though most of the gangrunners prey upon convoys and travelers for sport, some of the brigands act as couriers or hired muscle for well-paying patrons in the Trade-Cities.

    <description>Though smaller and not as powerful as adult Golmaera, whelplings will fiercely defend themselves from predators or other interlopers that invade their domain.

Golamaera:
Golmaera are chimeric beasts with long serpentine tails and three heads—those of a bear, a wolf, and a raven. Due to their oneness with nature, they are highly resistant to poisons and imbued with the primal fury of the forest itself. Druids and the woodland creatures revere the Golmaera as guardians of the wilds, and they often recount tales of how the beasts can sever limbs with a single bite from their bear jaws, stun prey with a wolf howl, and nullify spellwork with a raven screech. Though they are fiercely territorial predators, these noble beasts will protect the forest and its inhabitants from the Howling and any other force that threatens the sanctity of nature.

    <description>Golmaera are few in number, and solitary adults often lay claim to extensive tracts of forestland. Given their rarity, the druids say that spotting one of the full-grown beasts is a good omen.

    <description>The Darkwild are enchanted creatures with bark for skin, leaves for fur, and a natural resistance to magic. Legends say that druids created these beasts and left them to roam the wilds.

    <description>These monstrous slime-coated creatures are born from Karybdiss, the entity that dwells deep beneath Korosoth Mountain. Three maggot-like heads extend from the Hydragors' bloated bodies, each one ending with a maw ringed in sharp teeth. Their mouths are always churning—always searching for food. With no eyes to track their prey, the Hydragors use a form of echolocation to hunt in the wilds of northwestern Lawbrand. Yet no matter how much flesh they devour, their hunger is never sated.

Upon spawning from Karybdiss, larval Hydragors slowly crawl up from the depths of Korosoth Mountain, feeding on insects, small animals, and carrion.

    <description>Adorned in armor and holy implements that ward off and disrupt magic, the Witch-Seekers specialize in tracking down and pacifying rogue spellcasters.

Knight-Paladin:
The solemn task of upholding order in Lawbrand falls to the Knight-Paladins. Highly trained and armed with enchanted weaponry, they are the bane of all who prowl the criminal underworld or use illegal magic. Though the Knight-Paladins see themselves as living embodiments of faith and the Order Militant's noble virtues, their grim determination and strict adherence to law sometimes makes them feared even among commoners. These holy warriors are given free rein by the Sularian Church to mete out justice, and they will do everything in their power to apprehend criminals—even if that means hurting innocents who get in their way.

    <description>To protect themselves from Orinfell's ultra-orthodox believers, the Magyir surround themselves with fierce gnoll "scrappers" trained in hand-to-hand combat.

Magyir:
These secretive gnoll mystics live in Sinners Mile near the outskirts of Orinfell. It is rumored that some of the oldest Magyir were cursed by the Howling but clung to their free will and fled the wilds, eventually settling at the edges of Lawbrand. Despite their troubling origins, they have used their mystic powers, which include the gift of foresight, to help the downtrodden denizens of Sinners Mile survive in a place that is hostile toward outsiders. Orinfell's religious zealots do not hide their animosity toward non-human races—and they consider the practice of mysticism heretical. For that reason, the Magyir must stay in the shadows and do whatever they can to survive.

Malefactor:
The Malefactors are the frontline captains of the powerful Draconis Malisath crime syndicate. These ruthless enforcers come from many different races, but they all wear the same distinct overcoats to signify who they are—and that they are not to be trifled with. Though they often employ underlings to do their bidding, the Malefactors are not above getting their hands dirty when necessary. Skilled in coercion as well as physical violence, they prowl the Trade-Cities, keeping local criminals in line and extorting money from business owners.

    <description>The Captains are feared throughout the criminal underworld for their unmatched fighting prowess. When injured, they can quickly mend their wounds by imbibing vampiric potions.

Malefactor:
The Malefactors are the frontline captains of the powerful Draconis Malisath crime syndicate. These ruthless enforcers come from many different races, but they all wear the same distinct overcoats to signify who they are—and that they are not to be trifled with. Though they often employ underlings to do their bidding, the Malefactors are not above getting their hands dirty when necessary. Skilled in coercion as well as physical violence, they prowl the Trade-Cities, keeping local criminals in line and extorting money from business owners.

    <description>These gifted shadow sorcerers can summon skeletal terrors to act as their servants and bodyguards. The Occultists owe this great power to the Necromanti's depraved leader, Kyssh. Though they exist to serve him, they are given free rein to choose how to enact their master's will. This independence has led many of the sorcerers to pursue their own secret agendas and even plot against each other to attain greater standing within the order. Yet, whatever their individual desires, the Occultists are careful not to practice their spellwork in public for fear of exposing the Necromanti's existence to the hapless masses.

    <description>Employed to haul machinery and other heavy resources, these giants are usually even-tempered—but they can be roused to violence when threatened or pestered.

Giant Laborer:
Once known as hill giants, these mighty beings fled their homes in the Barrier Wilds to escape the Howling's onslaught. They carved out a new home for themselves in Lawbrand, becoming valued citizens. Due to their natural physical strength, they are highly sought after by Lawbrand's mining and construction companies. Most quarry giants live on the outskirts of the Trade-Cities, but they are not reclusive. Though their immense size makes it difficult for them to enjoy local taverns and other venues, many of them enjoy walking the streets and engaging with their fellow citizens.

    <description>Deemed too savage even by the other Ravenous, these wretched creatures wander the desert, hunting prey in lonely solitude.

Ravenous:
The Ravenous are cursed ma'ii who have become trapped between their humanoid and coyote forms. These feral creatures are driven by a deep need to feast on blood and flesh. Ma'ii who succumb to this tragic state are rare, and many of them have sought safety in numbers by banding together and forming a new tribe of their own. These outcasts dwell within the Ridge of Spears in the eastern Tanaroch and are led by the oldest and most vicious of their kind: Blisterfang. Filled with hatred and bitterness at the knowledge that they can never rejoin society, the Ravenous slake their bloodlust on all those who are not of their kind.

    <description>These Ravenous bite and claw their way to power through sheer might and malice, and they will brutally slaughter anyone who threatens their place in the hierarchy—especially rival Spinerippers.

Ravenous:
The Ravenous are cursed ma'ii who have become trapped between their humanoid and coyote forms. These feral creatures are driven by a deep need to feast on blood and flesh. Ma'ii who succumb to this tragic state are rare, and many of them have sought safety in numbers by banding together and forming a new tribe of their own. These outcasts dwell within the Ridge of Spears in the eastern Tanaroch and are led by the oldest and most vicious of their kind: Blisterfang. Filled with hatred and bitterness at the knowledge that they can never rejoin society, the Ravenous slake their bloodlust on all those who are not of their kind.

    <description>Resilient to physical attacks and armed with massive two-handed weapons, these Risen exude an aura of terror. Only a glimmer of their former identity remains, but their dedication to the order's mission in Lawbrand is undiminished.

The Risen:
For years, knights belonging to the ultra-orthodox Circle of Thorns have died in battle and been entombed in the catacombs beneath Orinfell. For a time, these fallen warriors were left in peace—but no longer. With their numbers diminishing, the living members of the Circle of Thorns have harnessed dark magics to bind the souls of their honored dead to suits of ornate, time-worn armor. These Risen now serve the order again in a state of undeath, acting as guardians and enforcers. Yet almost nothing of who they once were or what they looked like in their former lives remains. Their armor covered with grave moss and thorny vines, spectral soul-mist trails the Risen wherever they tread—instilling fear in all who look upon their unholy forms.

    <description>These fierce survivalists are armed with slings and bows to bring down their prey from afar, but they also delight at the chance to fight with their bare hands.

Skull Taker:
Based out of Xu'keen'ar village in the Barrier Wilds, these cannibalistic warriors are among the fiercest predators in the land. They are renowned for their battle prowess, hunting skills, and ability to track almost anything that passes through the forest. Despite their diminutive size, Skull Takers fight with utmost savagery against any enemy, no matter how big or menacing their foe might be. They are highly territorial and harbor a deep mistrust of outsiders, especially the larger humanoid races. Strangers who pass through the Skull Taker's domain are often forced to pay a toll by battling in one of Xu'keen'ar's fighting pits. The losers, if they survive the combat, are rarely allowed to go their way. More often, they become the centerpiece of the village's next ceremonial feast.

    <description>Trained to dual-wield weapons and lash out at their enemies in a murderous frenzy, the Brute quietly stalk the edges of xu'keen territory in search of intruders. They decorate the forest with bones, limbs, and other grisly trophies as a warning to anyone who strays too close to their land.

Skull Taker:
Based out of Xu'keen'ar village in the Barrier Wilds, these cannibalistic warriors are among the fiercest predators in the land. They are renowned for their battle prowess, hunting skills, and ability to track almost anything that passes through the forest. Despite their diminutive size, Skull Takers fight with utmost savagery against any enemy, no matter how big or menacing their foe might be. They are highly territorial and harbor a deep mistrust of outsiders, especially the larger humanoid races. Strangers who pass through the Skull Taker's domain are often forced to pay a toll by battling in one of Xu'keen'ar's fighting pits. The losers, if they survive the combat, are rarely allowed to go their way. More often, they become the centerpiece of the village's next ceremonial feast.

    <description>As members of the Fangs of Scyllia cult, Soulstalkers live to spread terror and chaos across Lawbrand. Yet the only thing that truly brings them joy is harvesting souls. Through phantasmal magic and fear-inducing illusions, these warlocks overwhelm their prey and rip the souls from their bodies. This stolen spiritual essence is bound to the Soulstalkers' glowing tattoos.
	With every new victim they claim, their magic grows stronger—as does their insatiable hunger for more. The only thing that prevents the Soulstalkers from wreaking havoc wherever they travel is the desire to keep the Fangs of Scyllia cult a secret from Lawbrand's troublesome authorities.

    <description>These monstrous brutes epitomize the Howling's unholy effect on nature. A forest of gnarled, bloodstained antlers rises from their stag heads. Ritual scarring marks their toughened skin. Cursed fetishes hang from their bodies, pulsing with poisonous magic. Yet as terrifying as their physical forms are, the Staggoth are even more feared for their intelligence. Clever and sadistic, they serve as the Howling's foremost generals and high priests.

The Darkrunners are swift and merciless raiders equipped with polearms. Without warning, they smash into enemy encampments and chase down anyone who tries to flee.
