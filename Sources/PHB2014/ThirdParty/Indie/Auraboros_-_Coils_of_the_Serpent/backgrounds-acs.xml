1-2 | I was what they call a "middle-management bro" for Revel. My job was drafting unfavorable contracts for upcoming "talent." Working for Revel was fun, but after a while, I got tired of screwing people over, and I quit...
3-4 | I was a junior investor at a small firm—and I invested heavily in Revel Inc. when they first got their start. Needless to say, the investment paid off, and now I'm a senior partner at my firm...
5-6 | I was a real partier back in the day. Such as I can remember, at least... My friends and I would travel wherever Revel events were happening, just to get trashed and tear it up a bit. I still don't really get it, but I guess Revel liked my vibe and hired me to oversee community relations at big events...
7-8 | I love working for Revel! I'm a huge fan of all the Slamstars, and I still can't believe I get to work with them! I'm in charge of washing their costumes and weapons before each event—and I swear, there's no amount of caked blood I wouldn't scrub for them!
9-10 | Crushing the competition isn't something that's just reserved for the arena. At Revel Corporate, it's a way of life. The Slamstars kill with blades and chains, but my methods are more subtle. Bribes, blackmail, doctored indictments—those are my weapons of choice. And I always make the kill...</text>

1-2 | I was a scribe at the local basilica. I spent my days studying and transcribing the holy scriptures passed down from Old Sularia. But looking at the world outside my window, I became interested in documenting the simple, everyday moments of faith that occur throughout the Trade-Cities...
3-4 | I was once a dedicated Sularian priest. As much as I condemned the vices in those around me, I secretly fell prey to my own internal demons. It all caught up with me, and I was excommunicated in disgrace...
5-6 | As an initiate priest, I clung to the strictest interpretation of Church doctrine. Like those orthodox believers in the Circle of Thorns, I believed that the Church had lost its moral authority in this complex modern age. I vowed to regain it through the example of my own discipline and piety...
7-8 | I was a missionary for many years. I traveled to outlying communities like Baker and Red Bluff, bringing the light of faith and performing what acts of service I could. Not everyone I encountered was interested in what I had to share, but it was an amazing experience, nonetheless...
9-10 | I was a fearless evangelist for the faith. A real firebrand. I spent my days preaching from street corners and market-centers. Strangely, I only ever converted a handful of believers; most people treated me with naked contempt. And yet they have the audacity to wonder why salvation eludes them...</text>

3-4 | I chose to become an Enforcer—indentured to a Knight-Paladin's entourage—in order to cut time off my prison sentence. I used my thieving skills to help him capture other fugitives. Dispensing justice for the Knight-Paladin felt dirtier than anything I ever did as an honest criminal...
