        <text>Wildkeepers are the elite warriors of the Oram Hai, tasked with guarding Lawbrand against the sinister Howling. They effortlessly wield druidic magic alongside their martial weapons, calling on the power of nature to dispatch their foes. When taking on the role of a Wildkeeper, the fighter must also take on an animal totem of their choosing, causing one of their body parts to permanently morph into an additional weapon in battle.

        <name>Spellcasting (Wildkeeper (HB))</name>
        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast druid spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the druid spell list.

Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 13th level.

Spell Slots. The Wildkeeper's Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Entangle and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Entangle using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, which you must choose from the evocation, conjuration, and transmutation spells on the druid spell list.
	The Spells Known column of the Wildkeeper Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation, conjuration, or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn two new spell of 1st or 2nd level. 
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the druid spells you know with another spell of your choice from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation, conjuration, or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier
	Spell attack modifier = your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spellcasting Focus. You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

        <name>Totem Bond (Wildkeeper (HB))</name>
        <text>At 3rd level you can bond with an animal totem by performing a vision ritual. The ritual is completed by taking a long rest after consuming your druidic herb (found in the starter gear). During the ritual, a totemic spirit animal of your choice appears in a vision—and you and the animal bond as one being. Upon awakening from the ritual, a body part of your choosing is replaced or augmented by a physical feature of your spirit animal. Examples of this include: your feet become cloven hooves, your hand transforms into a talon, or antlers sprout from your forehead…
