        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Eminence (HB)</name>
        <text>The monks of the Bohen Dur spend their entire lives training to harness what they have come to call "Eminence." These warriors project a sphere of Eminence around them at all times, exerting their will to nearby beings. Through thoughts alone, they can detect creatures, strike with their minds, and even disrupt the flow of magic itself.

        <name>Sphere of Eminence (Way of Eminence (HB))</name>
        <text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you project an intense aura in a 5 ft. radius. The size of your Sphere of Eminence increases to 10 ft. at 6th level, to 15 ft. at 11th
level, and again to 20 ft. at 17th level.
 	Your Sphere of Eminence can be turned on or off with a bonus action and provides the following benefits while active:

	• You know the location of all creatures within your Sphere of Eminence.
	• You have Advantage on Wisdom checks caused by any creature within your Sphere of Eminence.
	• You can use your reaction to increase your AC by 2 when you are attacked by a creature that is within your Sphere of Eminence.

        <text>At 3rd level, melee attacks may be made with your mind against any creature within your Sphere of Eminence that you can see—without requiring you to physically touch them. Martial Arts attacks made in this way use Wisdom modifiers instead of Dexterity or Strength.

        <text>When you reach 11th level, you can cast Counterspell by spending any number of ki points, up to a maximum of 9, targeting only creatures within your Sphere of Eminence.
	If the spell being cast is of a level higher than the number of ki points spent, make an ability check using your Wisdom modifier. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect. You may use this ability three times per long rest.
