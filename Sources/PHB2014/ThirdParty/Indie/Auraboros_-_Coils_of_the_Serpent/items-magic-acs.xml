    <text>This mighty axe, crafted upon the Sunforge of Red Bluff, can cleave through solid stone. Its blades have been sharpened with crystals of bloodstone, leaving small shards embedded into the axe's edges. These shards give the axe an incandescent amber glow and allow the wielder to absorb mystical energy from nearby foes.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties:

Energy Absorption: When a creature is slain by an attack with this weapon, the wielder regains 1 expended 1st-level spell slot and a 2nd-level spell slot. If the creature is slain by a critical hit with this weapon, the wielder regains 1 expended spell slot of 1st level, 2nd level, 3rd level, and 4th level.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: martial, battleaxe

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, handaxe

    <text>This graceful, fire-blackened sword was crafted by smiths of the Children of the Sun whose names were lost to the desert winds long ago.The blade, which appears to glow with an inner fire, can protect its user by absorbing heat from any source.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

The wielder of this weapon gains resistance against fire. This weapon can absorb a small source of nonmagical fire to emit light in a 10 ft. radius on command, lasting up to one day.

The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
