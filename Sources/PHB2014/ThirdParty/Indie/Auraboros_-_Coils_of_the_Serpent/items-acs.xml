    <text>A mechanical marvel, the Apparatus serves a dual purpose as both a climbing device of incredible utility and as a deadly weapon. Rumored to have once been wielded by an elite member of the Draconis Malisath, this device could allow the user to reach locations that would be impossible by normal means. Though it's held that the device was lost in the wilds near Wallaroo, it's unlikely that the Malisath would relinquish such a precious tool without a fight.

As an action, select a solid object such as a wall or ceiling within 60 ft. and immediately zip to this point in a straight line. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

The Apparatus may also be used in combat as a one-handed versatile melee weapon that deals 2d6 damage.

As an action, make a ranged attack against a creature within 60ft. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage and makes a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to the attack roll. On a failed save, the target is immediately pulled 15 ft. in a direct line toward the attacker. If the target is huge or larger, the attacker instead may choose to be pulled 15 ft. closer to the target.

    <text>These twin daggers are rumored to have been carved from the bones of one of the deadly Ravenous. Their lightweight nature allows for preternaturally quick strikes, giving them an almost ghostly effect that confounds slower enemies.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 

These daggers have 1 charge. They regain 1 charge at dawn.

As a bonus action, you can expend a charge to create a mirage-like apparition in the form of a snarling Ravenous that appears directly above you and mimics your every move and expression. This ghostly illusion gives any attack against you disadvantage until the start of your next turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, dagger

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

After a target suffers any harm from this weapon, they must succeed a Wisdom saving throw with DC equal to 10 + your Proficiency modifier. If the creature fails, it retreats into its own mind, immediately dropping their weapon and becoming frightened.

The shadow of Malevolence appears darker than other objects, and its weight seems heavier in your hands after it has taken a life.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties:

Devour Essence: When this weapon deals a killing blow to a creature that has at least one resistance and is not undead, you sever the creature's ties to the corporeal realm, absorbing its soul into Malevolence. The wielder of Malevolence gains one of the resistances (GM's choice) the creature had for 24 hours and gives the weapon 1 charge, up to a maximum of 12.

Unleash Essence: As an action, while Malevolence contains the essence of a slain creature, you may expend charges to deal damage in a 15 ft. cone in front of you for xd6 necrotic damage, where x is the number of charges expended. If you expend charges in this way, you lose all resistances gained from Malevolence

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

Attacks with this weapon deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage. Any damage dealt is gained as temporary hit points. (Temporary hit points do not stack.)

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Inscribed along its ornate pommel is the original owner's name—Saldred Oth'Sular, the first and only Emperor of Old Sularia. The sacred hammer's presence in Lawbrand is the stuff of legend—a legend not only of the great man who wielded it but of the righteous power that Sularia once represented.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties:

Light-Blessed:
	• Attacks with this weapon deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage. The hammer has 3 charges.
	• While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge for the following effect: when a creature suffers harm from this weapon, a pillar of light strikes down, blinding the target for 1 turn and dealing 4d10 radiant damage, causing the creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the creature succeeds, it takes half as much damage and is not blinded.
	• Additionally, the pillar of light continues to shine for 1 minute, taking the space of a Medium creature. If a creature passes through it or begins its turn in it, it deals 2d6 radiant damage to that creature.

Heavy: Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

When an attack made with this bow successfully hits an enemy, the arrow then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 ft. of it must succeed a Dexterity saving throw with DC equal to 10 + your proficiency or take 2d6 thunder damage.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>Shaped to resemble a dragon's flaming maw when fully expanded, the Accordion of Wondrous Delights is capable of producing numerous magical effects when played, and most of them are usually beneficial to its player...

While playing this accordion, you are able to call upon its wondrous powers once per day. The accordion has a switch that swaps its capability for show or combat. While playing for show, you can play the accordion safely without any additional effects. In combat, the accordion has a will of its own, resulting in any number of random effects. As an action, you may play the accordion and let loose one
of its wondrous delights by consulting the Accordion of Wondrous Delight Effects table

Accordion of Wonderous Delights Effects:
d10 | Effect
1 | Water shoots from the accordion into the sky, raining down in a 30 ft. wide circle, healing all friendly creatures for 2d8.
2 | Every creature within 30 ft. of the accordion is affected by Enlarge/Reduce (Enlarge).
3 | Every creature within 30 ft. of the accordion is affected by Enlarge/Reduce (Reduce).
4 | A loud burst of heinous sound emits from the accordion. Every creature within 30 ft. must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If failed, the creature is frightened for 1 minute.
5 | A scintillating, chromatic mist emanates from the accordion. All creatures within 30 ft. of the user gain the benefits of a long rest.
6 | The boisterous tune emanates from the accordion, invigorating you. For the next 10 minutes, you gain +5 AC.
7 |  Lost in the accordion's rhythms, you fall through reality itself and reappear anywhere within 100 ft. (The GM decides where you appear.)
8 | Flashes and multicolored sparks erupt from the accordion's keys as all creatures within 30 ft. may take an extra action for 1 minute.
9 | Howling winds burst from the accordion, allowing creatures to fly at a speed of 60 ft. for 10 minutes.
10 | The accordion starts flashing and making extremely loud, discordant noises. During the next round, it will explode, harming all creatures within 30 ft. for 6d20 damage and forcing them to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. In the following round after it explodes, the accordion magically reappears in your hand.

    <text>An ebony instrument with flame motifs engraved in silver, the Blazing Lute features incredibly resistant strings of elvish making. As you play it, sparks begin to fly from the strings, growing in intensity as you play faster. As your notes increase in speed, the sparks turn to fire, flicking outward into a roaring flame. Keep playing, and the fire dances before you... but play too long, and the flames might just consume you.

When this lute is played, a beautiful fire erupts. Each creature in a 15 ft. radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases by 1d6 for each consecutive turn the flute is played, up to a maximum of 8d6. The lute may only play one song per short rest.

Made of bone and patched animal hides, the drums still manage to deliver a tremendously powerful percussive sound. Playing them sends physical reverberations through all nearby creatures—driving them into an aggressive frenzy. 

As an action, begin pounding the drums of doom to bring about a frenzy. All creatures within 60 ft. gain advantage on Strength checks and Saving throws and become resistant to all nonmagical damage. This effect lasts for as long as the drums are being played

    <text>This lavish ivory lyre, covered in golden etchings and filigree, has a distinct feature atop its yoke—the visage of a winged unicorn. The unicorn's horn gives off a radiant light that seems to accentuate any tune played on the lyre, casting a feeling of warmth to all nearby.

As an action, begin strumming the horned lyre to soothe the emotions of listeners. All creatures within 60 ft. make a Wisdom saving throw and do so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting them. If they fail the saving throw, they are Charmed by you until the music stops or until you or your companions do anything harmful to them. The Charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was Charmed, but not by whom

    <detail>rare</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This mysterious, multifaceted device whizzes and whirrs with a mechanical whine. As you watch, it shudders and reconfigures itself into the form of a small, clockwork automaton with spindly appendages and spidery feet. Built by the engineers in Talis to perform several distinct functions, the automaton seems capable of accepting a very specific set of commands...

The G.A.DGET has 5 charges. It is a device that can transform as needed. As an action, you can command the G.A.DGET to perform a duty, listed below. The G.A.DGET regains 1d4 charges every day at dawn. If you expend the G.A.DGET's final charge, it overheats and explodes, dealing 2d6 fire damage to all creatures within 10 ft.

Fire Net Cannon: Shoot a net attached to a rope at a target up to 30 ft. away. The target creature must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If failed, the creature is restrained and is dragged to your location at a speed of 30 ft.

Deploy Fire Extinguisher: G.A.DGET can put out small fires without being asked. In fact, G.A.DGET insists on doing so, even if you may not want it to.

Become a Barricade: Expand to form a 15 ft. wide barricade. G.A.DGET roots itself and widens up, blocking the sight of any creatures from seeing the other side of it. This effect lasts up to ten minutes.

While in barricade form, G.A.DGET has the following statistics:

	• G.A.DGET can only be damaged through physical means, and if it's hit points reach 0, G.A.DGET becomes broken and won't work until the owner takes a long rest.
	• Hit Points: 200
	• AC 7

Become a Rolling Cage: Transform into a cage with wheels. The cage can fit up to three medium creatures or one large creature. The bars are extremely durable, making it incredibly difficult to bend or break. The cage can be moved by a creature with Strength 14 or higher at a speed of 20 ft.

Become a Collapsible Campsite: G.A.DGET simply has everything a small party would need for a campsite within it, including the materials for a tent, campfire, and bed rolls. When creating a campsite this way, it is always considered a Success, but players should roll to cook their food separately.

Become a Collapsible Raft: G.A.DGET becomes a huge life raft that can easily fit up to 7 people on it.

	• 1: Your AC is reduced by −1. Creatures that hit you with melee attacks take 1d4 piercing damage.

This horn has 3 charges. As an action, the horn can be blown to summon a stampede of spectral bison, which trample anything in their path. The horde of bison charge through your immediate area, requiring every creature in a 15 ft. cone in front of you to make a Dexterity saving throw of DC 18. Creatures in the affected area take 3d6 damage and are knocked back 15 ft. on a failed save, or take half as much damage and are not knocked back on successful one.

You can spend an action and break the scepter, releasing the haunting spirit trapped within it. The spirit within haunts the nearest creature other than the one who broke the scepter for 1 minute. While haunted, any action taken by that creature immediately results in 2d4 necrotic damage. The creature who broke the scepter gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. Once broken, the haunting spirit is unable to be restored and the scepter is useless.
