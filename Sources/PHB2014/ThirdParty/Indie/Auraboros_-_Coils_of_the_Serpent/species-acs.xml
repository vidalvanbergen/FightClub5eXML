      <text>Spending most of their lives either beneath the waves or on the Wassica Islands, atsaad are amphibious humanoids that live for adventure and exploration. They tend to be
excellent scavengers, and their boundless curiosity makes them invaluable allies whether diving deep underwater or spelunking through dark caverns.

      <name>Appearance</name>
      <text>Atsaad are exotic humanoids with aquatic features. Their facial features are soft and thoughtful, with large dark eyes that seem to stare into the soul. Their lithe bodies are covered by fine, mottled scales, with colors ranging across the entire spectrum. Down the backs of their heads, long tendrils flow like braids-often adorned with beads or brightly colored bands. Their hands and feet have slight webbing between the digits.</text>

      <name>Tidal Bond</name>
      <text>Being amphibious humanoids, atsaad can flourish both on land and in the sea. They feature unique cranial tendrils that some biologists believe act as psycho-emotional antennae, allowing the atsaad to read other creatures' emotional states when they are submerged within proximity to them. The atsaad can also sense the flow of water from region to region-almost tasting the scent of distant places in the particles. They believe that all are one and bonded by the world's moving waters; emotions move like currents, and the atsaad often try to keep things in stillness around them.</text>

      <name>Heart for Exploration</name>
      <text>Atsaad are driven by a deep sense of adventure and exploration—an insatiable curiosity about the horizon and the possibility of new exotic places and peoples. They enjoy interacting with others, even those not of their own kind, which drives their curiosity. They hold their family pods as the highest priority.
	They are generally upbeat and positive in their outlook and seek to aid those around them for the greater good of society. They make great teammates and collaborators. If any drawbacks can be said of them, it's that some atsaad are prone to daydreaming and not keeping their head on the task in front of them.</text>

These holdouts retain their ancestral tribal identities and are committed to maintaining their own cultural identity. They are often violent and xenophobic to all outsiders and see their urbanized land-dwelling brethren as traitors to their people.
	There are rumored to be upwards of twenty different atsaadi tribes, but the three largest are the most commonly recognized by the people of Lawbrand. Their tribal names are roughly translated from Wassic.</text>

      <text>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs-these common threads unite all dwarves.

Forged in the heat of the Tanaroch, the desert dwarves of Red Bluff have built their lives around defiance. Defiance against the elements, against society, and against any others who would threaten their way of life. They are a rugged, obstinate people who have been hardened by  both exposure to the harsh climate and their own troubled history.

      <text>Desert dwarves are of average height and build for dwarves. Their skin is a rich brown. On average, their hair can have a distinctively reddish-blond hue—a lingering trait from their northern heritage. But many desert dwarves also have brown, black, or white hair. They adorn themselves with heavy tattoos and piercings. They can appear rough and unkempt to the more urbanized citizens in Lawbrand. The desert dwarves wear skins trimmed with light fur and light leathers and cloth. Many favor leather kilts over more traditional leggings. They often wear distinctive head wraps, which help to focus their eyesight in the open desert as much as keep their heads protected from the sun.</text>

      <name>Refugees of the Wasteland</name>
      <text>When the dwarven refugees from Old Sularia first trekked into the Tanaroch to find a land of their own, they were led by the mountain dwarf hero, Dragran Stonefury. The steadfast Dragran hoped to create a better, more equitable dwarven society than that of Mitholme. After establishing their stronghold at Red Bluff, the dwarves again fell to bickering about how best to rule and share power between their factional groups. Dismayed that the dwarves' cycle of mistrust might start all over again, Dragran abandoned Red Bluff to seek solitude in the wasteland. He was never heard from again. Most desert dwarves believe Dragran perished out in the desert. To honor their beloved leader, they built an ornate tomb within the Cavern of the Last Fist deep beneath Red Bluff.
	The loss of Dragran's singular leadership forced the dwarves to pull together and share authority over their burgeoning new home. With the rise of the dwarven shaman, a new unity arose between the factions. The shaman's deep relationship with the elemental spirits of the land around them assured the other dwarves that they could flourish in the Tanaroch-spiritually bound to the land as a singular people.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Bloodstone</name>
      <text>The dwarves discovered innumerable deposits of strange red shale embedded around the mesa and throughout the surrounding desert. They found that the shale had remarkable properties for storing heat and energy. Naming it "bloodstone," the dwarves began working it into the alloys of their weapons and tools. They created great sheets of bloodstone, which they installed around the periphery of the mesa's central cavern—its stored heat helping to keep their crops warm during the cold desert winters.
	The bloodstone's red dust settled everywhere throughout the mesa-city. Over time, its particles seeped into the dwarves' pores and lungs-changing them forever. The red dust caused the dwarves' skin to toughen, making them highly resistant to the desert's searing heat.
	Later, as trade was established with Lawbrand in the west, the wondrous bloodstone became a precious commodity, and its mining and refinement proved to be highly lucrative enterprises for the craftsmen of Red Bluff. In fact, bloodstone became so prolific in their society, the dwarves came to use it as a general surname for orphans or those citizens who couldn't trace their lineage from before the Fall of Old Sularia.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Territorial Enmity</name>
      <text>Since the founding of Red Bluff, the desert dwarves have had a longs-tanding feud with the Tanaroch's native ma'ii packs. Both peoples, desperate to claim the desert's meager resources for their own, have engaged in many bitter battles over the years. Still, both cultures are few in number, so they tried to avoid costly raids and fights whenever possible.
	These heated skirmishes still occur from time to time-and are often compounded by the predations of the Ravenous. These monstrous, lycanthropic offshoots of the ma'ii people terrorize everyone within the desert's eastern regions. Striking from their savage holds in the Ridge of Spears, the Ravenous prey upon dwarf and ma'ii alike. The dwarves, making no distinction between the noble ma'ii and their Ravenous kin, harbor only hatred and mistrust for the whole furry lot.</text>

      <text>The ma'ii are a shamanic people—in tune with the spirits of the land and the spirits of their ancestors. Their culture holds the shamanic calling in the highest esteem. The ma'ii listen to the voices within the wind and earth, intent on gleaning whatever insight the capricious spirits might share. Every stone, dune, and swirling zephyr is sacred to the maii. To them, the entirety of the Tanaroch is holy ground.
	Their predatory senses and instincts make them master hunters and allow them to survive the grueling desert with ease. While they have no formal armed forces, their fearless and implacable warriors provide a formidable defense striking from the desert shadows, only to fade away as if taken by the winds.
	The ma'ii are generally good-natured but have an intense independent streak and hate to be confined by rules especially those instituted by other societies. They appreciate that some in Lawbrand consider them savage and insular. It amuses them to be seen as such.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Spirit of the Coyote</name>
      <text>Ma'ii are shapeshifters—able to transform their bodies into the forms of large desert coyotes. This unique aspect has been part of their makeup from their beginnings. None know the true origins of this ability, but many tales have been woven over the years to account for their miraculous shapeshifting. The most famous legend-the Tale of Laughing Paw-is known by all ma'ii tribes.
	The tale holds that a stubborn human man, Doh'bik, was the first ma'ii-and that he was known to laugh in the face of destiny. Seeking his own enjoyment, he had left his people behind and was dying of thirst and starvation in the desert. Coyotes hunted him every night. The voice of the South Wind, offering a benevolent bargain, sent him jackrabbits to eat every morning he could live if only he would go back home to his people. But the stubborn Doh'bik laughed at the South Wind and bucked fate by feeding the rabbits to the coyotesperpetuating the silly game. The South Wind, offended by the laughing mortal, transformed him into one of the restless coyotes-fated to wander the desert wastes as a vagabond forever. It is said that to this day, Doh'bik's barking laughter can still be heard echoing upon the southern wind.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>The Beast Within</name>
      <text>While in coyote form, the ma'ii possess full consciousness-though they can, at times, succumb to a base animal instinct and feral viciousness. Though rare, these tendencies can affect them even in their humanoid state. Thus, at the age of thirteen, most ma'ii children participate in the Sho'kote. During the Sho'kote, young ma'ii are sent off alone into the desert—to survive for one week and try to come to grips with the feral beast within.
	Rarely, some ma'ii fail to control their bestial natures and become lost in the desert, overwhelmed by animalistic rage. They transform into the Ravenous—mindless lycanthropes who live only to murder and feed. Thankfully, most of the children return home to their packs, their humors balanced to live the rich, nomadic life of their people.</text>

      <text>The ma'ii's nomadic family groups are called packs. When gathered together, ma'ii are loud and boisterous people-reveling in family and their ancient, eccentric traditions. The story of the ma'ii is woven into the tapestry of destiny. Due to the kindness of fate, the ma'ii live carefree, as the desert provides for all their needs. This leads to the ma'ii being a cheerful, upbeat people. Older ma'ii are prone to blindly make decisions, as whatever the winds of fate have in store for them is destined to be.
	However, they can be distrusting of outsiders especially those who hail from the cities of Lawbrand. Culturally it is the way of the ma'ii to be tricksters, and when conversing with an outsider, they often speak in cryptic puzzles that leave much to interpretation. They are a wily but honorable people. Ma'ii pride themselves on always keeping their word-even if their intent is somewhat obfuscated.</text>

While retaining all of your statistics, skills, and saving throw proficiencies, you additionally gain the following properties.

	• Armor Class: 13
	• Speed: 50 Ft.

Actions:
	• Bite: Melee Weapon Attack (finesse), 1d4 piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed a Dexterity saving throw of DC = 8 + your Dexterity modifier or be knocked prone.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
	You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from
taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
	You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. Your new form can use the same special senses as your normal form (such as darkvision).
	Your equipment merges into your new form. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment visually, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

      <name>A Loss of Connection...</name>
      <text>The ancient salamar empire of Ax'oloth was a glorious merging of nature and craftsmanship, where stone temples were built around living trees and streams—creating a perfect natural balance. The salamar held a miraculous link between themselves and the trees within their realm—like a collective dream that bonded them to each other and to the natural world. In this way, the salamar experienced a deep, profound wholeness. Yet, five thousand years ago, a horrific catastrophe consumed the rainforests of Axo'loth and brought ruin to its grand temples. As their beloved land burned, the salamar's delicate bond collapsed, leaving them to wallow in isolation and bitter grief.
	Though many salamar survived the ruin of their paradise, their race never fully recovered from the loss of their bonded existence. For them, the longing to get back to the state of transcendent oneness was less of a desire and more of an overriding racial imperative. Over time they came to see lost Ax'oloth as less of a place and more of a state of being. Given this perspective, modern salamar set themselves to discovering a way to regain their bond with each other and with nature.
	Believing that by looking closely enough in the right places and dedicating themselves completely to their experiments, they could find a way back to the unity they experienced in Ax'oloth. Using modern-day sciences such as botany and chemistry, and even the study of the arcane arts, the salamar hope to devise a means to reconnect with the natural world.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Unlikely Heroes</name>
      <text>In recent years, many younger salamar have been swept up in Lawbrand's burgeoning youth movement. Drawn to engage with the world around them as opposed to ignoring it like their elders traditionally have, these curious salamar saw new opportunities to appreciate the beauty and wonderment of society—and to create lasting relationships with their fellow citizens. These youths abandoned botany and alchemy and instead took a wide array of jobs and roles within the Trade-Cities. Eager to learn and be productive members of society, many of them even became explorers and adventurers with great potential for daring heroism.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Once peaceful halflings forced to survive the unforgiving wilds on their own, xu'keen have become hardened individualists who tend toward aggressive behavior and combativeness. They use their natural traits and experience to set their own path in life, often seeking to prove themselves against "bigger folk" that might underestimate their prowess and courage.

      <name>Appearance</name>
      <text>The xu'keen are small, wiry humanoids with taut muscles and sharp facial features. Their skin tones range from a chalky white to warm grays. They have beady eyes, often ringed with yellow irises, and sharpened teeth. They favor scarification as the primary
means of decorating their bodies and have numerous piercings. They are fond of wearing outlandish bone-fetish trinkets. They often look dangerous and intimidating, as if ready to spring to violence, even when calm.

      <name>Names</name>
      <text>When acclimating into urbanized society, most xu'keen choose to take on Common word nicknames, rather than use their traditional tribal or family names. Often, these nicknames are as edgy and fierce as the Xu'keen themselves.

Nicknames: Shank, Rip, Shiv, Gruff, Shrike, Bite, Spar, Gnaw, Skar</text>

      <name>Underfoot and Overwhelmed</name>
      <text>The halflings of Old Sularia were rarely taken very seriously by the "big people." When the empire fell and the mass migrations to the south began, the halfling refugees were caught underfoot and nearly trampled by the other races. When the refugees bottlenecked at the Barrier Pass and the violence erupted—the halflings scurried for their lives. Most of their kind never made it out of the battlefield known as the Sea of Bones... and those that did were changed forever.</text>

    <trait category="description">
      <name>Indomitable Survivors</name>
      <text>The former halflings that survived the Battle of the Barrier Peaks were left scarred and broken by their ordeal. Taking the name xu'keen, an old dwarven term for "feral," they changed significantly in temperament and aspect. Their skin and eyes drained of color-leaving them with a bone-white appearance. It is rumored that many of them even resorted to cannibalism to survive over time. This claim has never been validated, but the troubling mystique remains. As the centuries passed and Lawbrand came to power, many of the xu'keen traveled south into the Trade-Cities seeking to escape from their hardscrabble survival in the wilderness.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait category="description">
      <name>Not Quite Model Citizens</name>
      <text>Xu'keen tend to be solitary and abrasive. They are somewhat selfish and paranoid by nature—as if they're constantly being hunted by some predator or another. They hate the idea of confinement—either physically or emotionally-and seek to live by their own rules and desires. Distrustful and aggressive by nature, it's hard for the xu'keen to make friends or endear themselves to the other citizens of Lawbrand. But when they do commit to their neighbors, they prove to be extremely loyal, if somewhat caustic, friends.</text>
