        <name>Roguish Archetype: Wraithblade (HB)</name>
        <text>These shadowy rogues bear the touch of the Draconis Malisath—the shadowy crime organization with vampiric origins. Able to move through and bend the shadows themselves, they use their skills to strike with deadly force on unsuspecting foes. As Wraithblades grow in power, the vampiric nature of the Malisath comes to the forefront, allowing them to absorb the life force of creatures with a killing blow.

        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you also gain the ability to Charm an intelligent creature through supernatural means once per long rest. As an action, you can target a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or more that can see your eyes and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw DC = 8 + Charisma modifier + proficiency bonus. On a failure, the creature is Charmed by you as long as you maintain eye contact. When the effect ends, the creature does not know it was Charmed by you.

        <text>Beginning at 9th level, you may take action to inscribe a bladed weapon with the runes of the Draconis Malisath, imbuing it with 3 charges.

        <name>Shapechange: Mistform (Wraithblade (HB))</name>
        <text>At 13th level, you can use the vampiric art of shape changing to turn into a cold, damp mist as a free action. While moving, you may take the form of mist, allowing you to move about undetected and fit through any gap. While in this form, you have a flying speed of 20 ft., can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. If air can pass through a space, your mistform can do so without squeezing; however, it cannot pass through water. Moving away from a creature in combat grants the same benefits as a retreat action. While in this form, you are immune to all nonmagical damage, and have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. If at any time you would become stationary, you immediately return to your corporeal form.

The next time you kill an enemy in this manner, you can choose to replace that Proficiency with a new one.
