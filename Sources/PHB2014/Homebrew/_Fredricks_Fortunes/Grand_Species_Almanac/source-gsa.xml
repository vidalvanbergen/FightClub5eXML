  <description>The world is vast, and not all its peoples are bound by the shapes we know. From the crack of a storm, the whisper of the abyss, or the patient growth of a forest, new lives emerge, each carrying the mark of their origin. This compendium gathers those ancestries: the strange, the rare, and the forgotten, waiting for a place at your table.

Inside, you'll find:

	• Elemental Lineages: Genasi who carry the spark of fire, crystal, ash, storm, and more, each a shard of the world's primordial heart.

	• Demonic Bloodlines: Tieflings warped by the endless chaos of the Abyss, their gifts and curses born from ancient demon lords.

	• Plantfolk: Wanderers of bark, bloom, thorn, and spore, who embody the eternal balance of growth and decay.

	• Elemental Sprites: Tiny spirits of flame, wave, stone, and wind; dazzling fragments of the world's first magic.

	• Seafolk Clans: Children of the tide, from reefborn guardians and abyssal hunters to storm-tossed drifters of the open sea.

	• Variants: New takes on familiar lineages, shaped by fresh enrivonments, new communities, or the pull of forces beyond mortal comprehension.

Each of the new species inside comes with its own lore, culture, and mechanics; all the tools needed to help you build characters that stand apart, with stories rooted in something strange and new.

Forge a new heritage. Tell a story no one's heard before.</description>
