        <text>Most warriors and combat specialists spend their years perfecting the classic arts of swordplay, archery, or polearm tactics. Whether the duelist of infantry martial weapons were seemingly perfected long ago, and the true challenge is to master them.
	However, some minds couldn't stop with the innovation of the crossbow. Experimentation with alchemical components and rare metals have unlocked the secrets of controlled explosive force. The few who survive these trials of ingenuity may become the first to create, and deftly wield, the first firearms.
	This archetype focuses on the ability to design, craft and utilize powerful, yet dangerous ranged weapons. Through creative innovation and immaculate aim, you become a distant force of death on the battlefield. However, not being a perfect science, firearms carry an inherent instability that can occasionally leave you without a functional means of attack. This is the danger of new, untested technologies in a world where the arcane energies that rule the elements are ever present.
	Should this path of powder, fire and metal call to you, keep your wits about you, hold onto your convictions as a fighter, and let skill meet luck to guide your bullets to strike true.

        <name>Adept Marksman (Gunslinger)</name>
        <text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to perform powerful trick shots to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms.

Trick Shots. You learn two trick shots of your choice, which are detailed in the "Fighter (Gunslinger): Trick Shots" spell list. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. Each use of a trick shot must be declared before the attack roll is made. You can use only one trick shot per attack. You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each time you learn a new trick shot, you can also replace one trick shot you know with a different one.

Grit. You gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You regain 1 expended grit point each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll for an attack with a firearm, or deal a killing blow with a firearm to a creature of significant threat (DM's discretion). You regain all expended grit points after a short or long rest.

Saving Throws. Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Trick Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier
