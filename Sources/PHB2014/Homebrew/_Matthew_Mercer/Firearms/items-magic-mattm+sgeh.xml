A ranged weapon similar to a sniper rifle.

The Scions' weapons-whether dead or alive-are constructed from the bones of formidable monsters which are then tortured with strong lightning, granting twisted appearance and savage fury to the armament. The weapon's osseous component grants it ancient strength, and the electricity that dances across its body brutalizes all who come in contact with it.

Scionic weapons all require attunement. When attuning to such a weapon, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you make attacks using this weapon, you fire electricity generated from the armament and can ignore the ammunition, barrel, or reload property of the weapon, dealing lightning damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. This weapon has the Guiding Fury property.

Guiding Fury: While holding this weapon, you can unleash the rage held within its bones to make a ranged weapon attack with advantage. On a hit, you deal the weapon's damage and lightning streaks from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a ranged weapon attack against the new target, and on a hit, deal the weapon's damage and the lightning streaks again. A creature can be targeted only once by each use of guiding fury. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

A thrown weapon that explodes on impact, can be volatile. Deals Fire damage on hit.

Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Explosive: Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons").

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Reload: A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).

A thrown weapon that explodes on impact, can be volatile. Deals Fire damage on hit.

Roaring scionic weapons are the pinnacle of scionic technology, requiring hefty resources to produce even one of them. They all require attunement. When attuning to such a weapon, a creature takes 5d8 lightning damage.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you make attacks using this weapon, you fire electricity generated from the armament and can ignore the ammunition, barrel, or reload property of the weapon, dealing lightning damage instead of the weapon's normal damage. This weapon has the Guiding Fury and Lightning Surge properties.

Guiding Fury: While holding this weapon, you can unleash the rage held within its bones to make a ranged weapon attack with advantage. On a hit, you deal the weapon's damage and lightning streaks from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a ranged weapon attack against the new target, and on a hit, deal the weapon's damage and the lightning streaks again. A creature can be targeted only once by each use of guiding fury. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Lightning Surge: When you hit a creature with this weapon, your speed increases by 5 feet until the end of your next turn, increasing with each subsequent hit.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Explosive: Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.
