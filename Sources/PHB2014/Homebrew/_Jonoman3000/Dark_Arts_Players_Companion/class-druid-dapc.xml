        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of Twilight (Dark Arts) (HB)</name>
        <text>The Circle of Twilight is an ancient sect of druids, long estranged from other druidic circles due to their differing outlooks on the natural world. The Circle of Twilight believes that the spirits of nature need regular sacrifices of beasts, natural and unnatural, and even the occasional human sacrifice. These druids meet in old, dying forests to perform secret blood rituals — rituals which they hope will appease the cruelest gods of the Old Faith. As a member of this circle, you realize nature's will is not of kindness and spirituality — it is of cruelty and sacrifice.

        <name>Ritual Sacrifice (Circle of Twilight (Dark Arts) (HB))</name>
        <text>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn how to perform rituals using the blood sacrifices of powerful foes. By using the body of a creature that has died within the last 8 hours as one of your spell components, you can cast any spell with the ritual tag from any class spell list without needing to prepare it. The gentle repose spell cast on a body that's been dead for less than 8 hours extends the duration that body may be used. You still need to use the other components of the ritual as normal.
	In order to cast a ritual in this manner, you need the body of a creature of a CR greater than or equal to the spell level of the ritual to be cast, and the spell must be of a level you have spell slots for. The creature used cannot be a construct, an undead, or an elemental. Once you complete the ritual, that creature cannot be used in any other rituals.

        <name>Life from Death (Circle of Twilight (Dark Arts) (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 2nd level, you can grasp the last breath of life energy from a falling creature, and use it to restore life to another. When a creature within 60 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and expend a spell slot to restore 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended, adding your Wisdom modifier to the total, to yourself or another creature you can see within 60 feet. You cannot target the creature you reacted to.

        <name>Circle Spells (Circle of Twilight (Dark Arts) (HB))</name>
        <text>The dark powers of twilight infuse you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to a number of circle spells, listed below in the twilight table.
	Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Circle of Twilight Spells:
Druid Level | Spells
3rd | darkness, gentle repose
5th | speak with dead, tides of blood*
7th | dominate beast, draining thread*
9th | dominate person, insect plague

        <name>Eyes of Twilight (Circle of Twilight (Dark Arts) (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 6th level, you gain darkvision with a radius of 60 feet, or you increase the radius of your darkvision by 30 feet if you already have it. Additionally, you can see through magical darkness for the radius of your darkvision.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Soulseeing (Circle of Twilight (Dark Arts) (HB))</name>
        <text>At 10th level, you gain the ability to see the souls of living creatures. As an action on your turn, you hone your senses to allow you to see the outline of any living creature or creature that has died within the last 8 hours. This allows you to see any creature within the radius of your darkvision, including invisible creatures, as well as creatures that are obscured in some manner, such as being behind a wall or in murky water. This sight can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. This sight can be maintained for up to 10 minutes by using your action each turn. If your turn ends and you haven't used your action to maintain this feature, it ends early.
	You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>When you reach 14th level, you become a master at performing rituals. Casting a spell as a ritual now only adds 1 minute to the cast time.
	Additionally, you can use your ritual sacrifice feature to cast spells that aren't rituals as if they were rituals. The spell chosen must be of 2nd level or lower, and must have a duration of 10 minutes or longer. The casting otherwise follows the rules outlined in the ritual sacrifice feature.
