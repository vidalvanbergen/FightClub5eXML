        <name>Blood Well (Blood Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, you gain a well of blood magic that is fueled through special dice called blood dice.

Blood Dice. You have two blood dice, which are d6s. A blood die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended blood dice when you finish a short or long rest You gain an additional blood die at 7th, 10th, and 15th levels.

Using Blood Dice. Blood dice can be utilized in two ways. As a bonus action, you can expend a blood die and regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled. Also, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can choose to expend a blood die and add the number rolled to the attack's damage roll. If you do so, the attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

        <name>Martial Archetype: Blood Knight (HB)</name>
        <text>The archetypal Blood Knight employs their own flesh and blood in the slaughter of their enemies. To a Blood Knight, battle is everything. It isn't winning or losing that drives them so much as it is the opportunity for a good fight. And when they find that fight, they use everything they have to contest their opponent. They utilize blood sacrifices to cast spells and grant themselves additional offensive and defensive capabilities, though at a steep cost.

        <name>Hemomancy (Blood Knight (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast hemomancy spells, detailed in chapter 3 of this companion.

Spell Slots. The Blood Knight table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
	During a short rest, you can choose to regain one of your blood knight spell slots. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher. You know two 1st-level hemomancy spells of your choice, chosen from the hemomancy spells detailed in chapter 3.
	The Spells Known column of the Blood Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more hemomancy spells of 1st level or higher. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
	Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the hemomancy spells you know with another hemomancy spell of your choice. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your blood knight spells, since your spells are powered through the resilience of your body. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a blood knight spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier
