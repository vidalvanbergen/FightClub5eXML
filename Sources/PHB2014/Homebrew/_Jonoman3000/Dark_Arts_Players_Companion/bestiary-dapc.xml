      <text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the archlich can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the lich can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

	• The archlich rolls 2d8 and takes the higher roll, regaining a spell slot of the level rolled or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.

	• The archlich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers thelich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich's lair.

	• The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, becoming paralyzed for 1 minute and taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear. A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</text>

    <description>Archliches are beings of immense magical power outmatched by only the gods themselves. Through their many millennia of existence, archliches have mastered all arts of necromancy. But these beings are still not satisfied with their near limitless power — they still yearn for more, and they hunger for even greater arcane knowledge. Supremely intelligent, these creatures enact schemes that last for hundreds of years — which is just a blip in their unending existence.
	An archlich appears almost completely skeletal, with only a few wisps of flesh and hair left on its frame. The lights of their eyes disappeared long ago, so all that remains are black, empty sockets. They choose to adorn themselves with kingly attire, believing themselves to be the rightful rulers of the land.

Dark Creation. Archliches are the oldest beings known to exist, originally and only created during the Crown Wars over ten thousand years ago. Long tired of the unending war, a few elves yearned to gain the power that would allow them end the war themselves. So these few became high mages, sages with unmatched magical power for their time. But they still needed more, as this war couldn't be ended with normal magic in the span of a single mortal life.
	So these mages devoted their entire lives to the study of necromancy, and learned the secrets to lichdom from their dealings with the dark gods of the time. These gods gave them the forbidden knowledge needed to ascend past even the most powerful liches, which hasn't been given to a mortal mind before or since. Using this knowledge, these mages began the arcane ritual. This ritual released a huge storm of necrotic power onto the world; an event now known as the Dark Disaster.
	The Dark Disaster destroyed an entire elvish kingdom, and reduced the surrounding area to a barren wasteland. This power also proved too much for the minds of the mages, and they lost all memory of their original purpose and their mortal life, but they had gained the power they had so desired.

Enemy of the Gods. Once the gods saw the destruction wrought by the Dark Disaster, they knew they needed to intervene. Celestial agents were sent to destroy these few archliches, but even the most powerful of angels couldn't fully destroy them. But eventually, after only a few months of destruction, all the archliches were banished to other planes, supposedly to never be seen again.
	After they were all dispatched, the gods sought to never allow another mortal to ascend to that degree of lichdom again. They used all their power to hide that forbidden knowledge, and even convinced some of the most evil deities to never to part with the knowledge.

Pact-makers. Although all the archliches were banished and trapped in their own demiplanes, a few of them have learned how to contact mortals in the material plane, though as of yet none have escaped the confines of their prison. By gaining mortal followers, an archlich hopes to free itself and become a ruler of the mortal world.
	Those that are make a pact with an archlich are granted a degree of magical power, with the assumption that they will serve and put all their resources towards freeing their master. They believe that with the outside influence gained through these pacts, they will eventually find a creature capable of freeing them and inflicting them upon the world.

Death and Restoration. An archlich's phylactery is located within its demiplane, and is completely indestructible and inaccessible to all but the archlich. However, this means that if an archlich were to escape from their confines and then allow their body to be destroyed, they would once again be trapped within the demiplane when their body reforms.
	Since an archlich requires the assistance of powerful spell casters to return to the material plane, it is necessary for them to attempt to create and hold allegiances with mortals. If a mortal was to learn how to summon an archlich from their plane of existence, the archlich would be obligated to keep that mortal alive and allied, for the archlich may need that mortal again if their body is destroyed and they are restored to their plane.

Undead Nature. An archlich doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.

    <description>Bloodbeasts roam destroyed forests and barren plains, searching for signs of life that signal the presence of their prey. These savage creatures scour the landscape for small towns and dens, snatching and devouring any residents that they find. Their victims are often found days later, drained of all their blood.
	Bloodbeasts take the form of thin, decrepit dire wolves, with crimson-hued fur and pale pink skin. Although these beasts look to be in ill health at first glance, the magic that runs through their veins makes them a powerful foe to face.

Beasts of Yeenoghu. When a hyena feasts on a creature slain by a gnoll fang of Yeenoghu, that hyena undergoes a horrid transformation into a gnoll. However, there is also another lesser known, unintended transformation: the creation of bloodbeasts. When a dire wolf eats a creature that has been slain in that way, it instead undergoes a transformation into a bloodbeast, a creature imbued with the savagery and insatiable hunger of Yeenoghu himself. This process is extremely rare, since the territories of gnolls and dire wolves rarely intersect. But when they do, these powerful beasts can wreak havoc among the small packs of gnolls that dot the barren landscapes these beasts call home.

Lone Hunters. When a bloodbeast is created, it quickly disappears from the scene of its creation and hides from the gnolls that accidentally brought it into existence. It is only after a few days that the beast is ready to venture out and search for its prey. Bloodbeasts stalk the landscape in the dead of night, searching for weak creatures that they can easily ambush and quickly kill. After becoming a blood beast, these creatures no longer have any desire to procreate or work in packs.

Enemy of the Gnolls. Larger groups of gnolls that see a bloodbeast will kill it on sight, knowing that these creatures can easily pick off all but the most powerful gnolls in one-on-one combat.

    <description>A cruorbat is the youngest form of cruorbeast, and it has the largest resemblance to its original form. These creatures appear to simply be giant bats at first glance, with their vampiric nature only coming into view upon closer inspection. They have deep crimson skin, larger fangs, and large red eyes. Otherwise, they behave exactly like a giant bat - they use echolocation, have large leathery wings, and swoop down to attack their foes.
	Those that fight these beasts quickly realize their true nature, however, as their wounds magically stitch back together. Ranged weapons are necessary to defend against a cruorbat attack, as the beasts are intelligent enough to fly out of reach to regenerate their health when their enemies have no counter to this tactic.

Cruorbeasts:
Awakened from death by a vampire's bite, a cruorbeast serves as a loyal pet, protecting the vampire from harm and following its orders unquestioningly. Much like their undead masters, cruorbeasts do not cast shadows and abhor sunlight and running water. However, these vampiric weaknesses are not as apparent as they are in true vampires, so many vampires will use these beasts as guardians during the daylight hours, since they do not take direct damage from sunlight.

Born from Death. While vampires usually do not bite non-humanoids, a special exception is made for giant bats. A relatively rare species, giant bats are highly sought after by upcoming vampires to become their servants. If one of these giant bats is slain by the vampire and then buried in the ground, it will rise the following night as a cruorbat under the vampire's control. These creatures are ravenous and bloodthirsty, much like the common vampire spawn that they accompany. Yet they manage to control their hunger at the request of their masters, only eating what is given to them - often the scraps of creatures killed by the vampire.

Loyal in Death. Every cruorbeast is bound to the vampire that created it, and they hate to leave their master's side - at least when its a cruorbat or cruorgheist. These creatures are able to leave on excursions that disallow them from seeing their master for long periods of time, but they prefer to take shorter flights that keep them within a few miles of the vampire's lair. If a vampire dies, then all of that vampire's cruorbeasts, with the exception of crour hulks, perish as well within the next 24 hours, since their master is the only meaning to their existence.

Protectors of the Lair. After they reawaken, cruorbeasts never sleep, remaining perpetually awake so that they may serve as constant watchdogs to their master. They sit on the balconies of their lair and in the treetops of the surrounding area, always looking out for potential intruders. If they spot any, they do not attack them. They instead opt to warn their master, waking them and alerting them to the intrusion. A cruorbeast will generally only attack if it has been ordered to by its master, in self-defense, or when severely underfed.

Undead Nature. A cruorbeast does not require air or sleep.

    <description>As they feast on more corpses, cruorbats become larger, stronger and more intimidating. After a few years of meals, cruorbats gradually evolve into cruorgheists, a much more powerful enemy with a far greater constitution. These creatures are masters at hit-and-run tactics, where they dive onto their foes and then retreat as necromantic energy allows them to regenerate enough for another dive. Another common tactic is grabbing a foe and then taking off into the air, dropping them a few seconds later to potentially secure a kill.
	In their transition, a cruorgheist has become far more monstrous in appearance. Their lithe body has been replaced with a far larger, more muscular frame, and their claws and fangs have become considerably larger. While a cruorbat can easily be mistaken as a regular bat, a cruorgheist's form is immediately noticeable. For this reason, cruorghiests typically aren't used as scouts, as they lack the cruorbat's capability of blending into the natural world.

    <description>A cruorhulk is yet another stage in the life of a cruorbeast, and it is the most seldom achieved. By allowing a cruorgheist to drink the blood of its vampire master, that cruorghiest can undergo a transformation into a cruorhulk, which is a gigantic beast that rivals the strength of its master. Because of their immense power and the food required to sustain them, even the most powerful vampire will rarely have more than one cruorhulk at its side.
	While the cruorhulk retains its loyalty to its master, it is no longer under their direct control, and its life is no longer connected with its master. This means that its master must take extra care in keeping a cruorhulk happy, since the beast is able to turn against them if it doesn't get enough food or care. However, this also means that if the vampire dies, then the cruorhulk will be able to take its revenge.
	By transforming into a cruorhulk, a cruorghiest loses its flight capabilities due to its body becoming too heavy for its wings to lift. While it is no longer a skirmisher, it is instead a fantastic front-line fighter, capable of protecting its master against some of the most powerful threats they might face.

Cruorbeasts:
Awakened from death by a vampire's bite, a cruorbeast serves as a loyal pet, protecting the vampire from harm and following its orders unquestioningly. Much like their undead masters, cruorbeasts do not cast shadows and abhor sunlight and running water. However, these vampiric weaknesses are not as apparent as they are in true vampires, so many vampires will use these beasts as guardians during the daylight hours, since they do not take direct damage from sunlight.

Born from Death. While vampires usually do not bite non-humanoids, a special exception is made for giant bats. A relatively rare species, giant bats are highly sought after by upcoming vampires to become their servants. If one of these giant bats is slain by the vampire and then buried in the ground, it will rise the following night as a cruorbat under the vampire's control. These creatures are ravenous and bloodthirsty, much like the common vampire spawn that they accompany. Yet they manage to control their hunger at the request of their masters, only eating what is given to them - often the scraps of creatures killed by the vampire.

Loyal in Death. Every cruorbeast is bound to the vampire that created it, and they hate to leave their master's side - at least when its a cruorbat or cruorgheist. These creatures are able to leave on excursions that disallow them from seeing their master for long periods of time, but they prefer to take shorter flights that keep them within a few miles of the vampire's lair. If a vampire dies, then all of that vampire's cruorbeasts, with the exception of crour hulks, perish as well within the next 24 hours, since their master is the only meaning to their existence.

Protectors of the Lair. After they reawaken, cruorbeasts never sleep, remaining perpetually awake so that they may serve as constant watchdogs to their master. They sit on the balconies of their lair and in the treetops of the surrounding area, always looking out for potential intruders. If they spot any, they do not attack them. They instead opt to warn their master, waking them and alerting them to the intrusion. A cruorbeast will generally only attack if it has been ordered to by its master, in self-defense, or when severely underfed.

Undead Nature. A cruorbeast does not require air or sleep.

    <description>A cursed oak is a treant that has been blighted by an evil force, transforming into a living gulthias tree, an engine of spreading blight throughout once tranquil forests. This corrupted being tirelessly carries out the will of the ancient evil that controls it, and attempts to spread that evil wherever it can.

Soul of Gulthias. A cursed oak is the soul of the ancient vampire Gulthias made manifest, and it harbors all of his evil within its branches. These creatures have no semblance of their former self left within them. Much like a normal gulthias tree, a cursed oak spreads blight and creates blighted creatures, with the only difference being its ability to move and act on its own.
	Using this animation, a cursed oak forcibly uproots healthy trees and plants, cursing them and then harboring the growth of blighted brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. Wherever the cursed oak walks, these cursed plants follow, growing with supernatural speed to engulf all that they come across. If they encounter a settlement, that settlement may disappear in a matter of days, or even a matter of hours, as plants overwhelm the buildings and roads.

Blightlord. All other blights are beneath the cursed oak in the chain of superiority. The cursed oak commands other blights, creating strategies and tactics far beyond the mind of your average blight. A cursed oak is always surrounded by other blights, which serve as its spies and its bodyguards. Through its system of roots, it can communicate with other blights within its area of corruption, creating a vast network of command.

Curing the Curse. The curse of Gulthias is powerful dark magic, and cannot be lifted by a remove curse alone. In order to lift the curse and restore the treant to its former self, the oak must first be knocked unconscious, such as through reducing its hit points to 0 without killing it outright. Once it is unconscious, another treant must perform an hour long ritual to lift the curse. If the ritual is interrupted, it must be restarted from the beginning.

    <description>Savage predators and skillful hunters, deathcrest apes climb through the dark chasms and destitute forests of the underdark, searching for sustenance. They hunt in small packs, devouring those that they come across in a frenzy of claws and teeth.

Beastial Origins. Deathcrest apes are the descendants of normal apes from the material plane, brought to the shadowfell through the dark portals that occasionally manifest in the deep gloom of dense jungle caverns. Against all odds, a few of these creatures managed to survive long enough for the shadowfell to corrupt their bodies, causing their claws to become larger and more monstrous, and transforming their hind feet into hooves. The Shadowfell has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As the years passed, these creatures became aware of the transformation being wrought upon them, and yet could do nothing to prevent it.

Devourers of All. In order to survive in the shadowfell, creatures must find a way to make do with whatever they find. One of the greatest adaptations of these creatures is their ability to eat any type of flesh - even the remains of an undead. While most creatures refuse to eat the undead due to their inability to

    <description>A fleshfiend is a powerful warrior that is most often found in the service of other devils. Although not true devils themselves, fleshfiends are treated like lesser devils on the infernal hierarchy, and they only serve greater devils and archdevils.

Evil Made Manifest. Fleshfiends originated in the Nine Hells many centuries ago, when powerful devils created a dark ritual to corrupt intruding humanoids, turning them into devilish fiends with no semblance of their mortal form remaining. The fleshfiends roam the Nine Hells, a gruesome reminder of the danger of remaining in that realm for too long.

Chained Ones. When fleshfiends are created, they are the fusion of 3 different humanoids, with the most powerful among them becoming the fleshfiend, and the others becoming chained ones. Chained ones appear to be smaller versions of the fleshfiend, with similarly leathery wings and sharp claws. The chained ones are independent thinkers, though they must obey the commands of the fleshfiend, which are always given through telepathy.

    <description>The title of bloodletter is given to fleshlings that have gained some level of mastery over hemomancy, becoming more intelligent and powerful in the process of their learning. A bloodletter acts as a war leader, commanding troops and sending them to battles. Although they aren't at the very top of the hierarchy, they are close to it and are highly respected by the lower members of a tribe.

Fiendish Blessing. Asmodeus bestows special blessings upon a bloodletter, gifts that recognize their prowess in battle and in the arcane arts. Thusly, a bloodletter has far greater regenerative abilities and a more impressive constitution than their counterparts.

Fleshlings:
The dreaded fleshlings dwell in clans within vast deserts and wastelands, always warring with one another for supremacy in the eyes of their god; Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells. Using their natural aptitude in hemomancy, these savage humanoids seek to expand their clans and rule alone over their barren landscapes. Each tribe has no interest in working together with other clans, instead opting to go to war with all that they can find.
	Most fleshlings have pink, flesh colored skin, which is how they earned their name. Their features are completely monstrous, with serrated teeth, multiple pairs of eyes, sharp claws, and fleshy 'fins' on their back. They wear clothing made of hides and strong leathers, useful materials for protecting their skin against the harsh sun of the desert.

Infernal Master. Fleshlings are the spawn of Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, and they revere him as their god. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them towards even greater wars and bloodshed. These creatures erect dark temples devoted to their lord, and they tirelessly follow his every order.

Warring Tribes. Fleshlings have no ties with other clans of their race, and they rarely keep allies for longer than a few weeks. They are just as quick to war with other tribes as they are to war with other races, so their clans stay relatively small as they remain in a constant state of war.
	Within a tribe, fleshlings live in a hierarchy based on a fleshling's power and their proficiency with blood magic. As fleshlings become more proficient with their clans magic, they rise among the ranks and may eventually become a clan leader.

    <description>The dreaded fleshlings dwell in clans within vast deserts and wastelands, always warring with one another for supremacy in the eyes of their god; Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells. Using their natural aptitude in hemomancy, these savage humanoids seek to expand their clans and rule alone over their barren landscapes. Each tribe has no interest in working together with other clans, instead opting to go to war with all that they can find.
	Most fleshlings have pink, flesh colored skin, which is how they earned their name. Their features are completely monstrous, with serrated teeth, multiple pairs of eyes, sharp claws, and fleshy 'fins' on their back. They wear clothing made of hides and strong leathers, useful materials for protecting their skin against the harsh sun of the desert.

Infernal Master. Fleshlings are the spawn of Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, and they revere him as their god. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them towards even greater wars and bloodshed. These creatures erect dark temples devoted to their lord, and they tirelessly follow his every order.

Warring Tribes. Fleshlings have no ties with other clans of their race, and they rarely keep allies for longer than a few weeks. They are just as quick to war with other tribes as they are to war with other races, so their clans stay relatively small as they remain in a constant state of war.
	Within a tribe, fleshlings live in a hierarchy based on a fleshling's power and their proficiency with blood magic. As fleshlings become more proficient with their clans magic, they rise among the ranks and may eventually become a clan leader.
