        <name>Primal Path: Path of Blood (HB)</name>
        <text>The Path of Blood is a path taken by only the most ruthless and battle-hungry barbarians. They do not care when they shed their own blood — in fact, they use that energy to empower their rage even farther, using their suffering to inflict wounds upon their foes through magical bonds of blood.
	While at first glance the Path of Blood appears to be powered by the same forces as the Path of the Berserker, the Path of Blood is far more magical in nature. Bloodragers use their blood in a form of hemomancy — a magic that utilizes blood sacrifices.

        <name>Bloodrage (Path of Blood (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting when you select this path at 3rd level, you can choose to ignite your blood with magical power during you rage. At the end of each of your turns while raging, you can choose to take 1d4 + half your barbarian level necrotic damage to release a burst of necrotic energy. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to the necrotic damage you took. The necrotic damage you take ignores resistance or immunity.

        <name>Scent of Death (Path of Blood (HB))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you gain the ability to smell the scent of the injured from up to a mile away, and accurately pinpoint the scent's direction. Once you get within 1000 feet of the source, you can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to determine its exact identity. On a success, you know the exact identity of the creature if you have encountered it before; otherwise you only determine its type and the severity of its injury. Either way on a success, you know the exact distance and direction to the injured creature. On a failed check, you know that you failed the check and can't make another one for 1 hour.

        <name>Sanguine Visions (Path of Blood (HB))</name>
        <text>Starting at 10th level, touching spilled blood allows you to see the circumstances under which the blood was spilled. As an action, you can touch at least a drop of blood that has been spilled within the last 48 hours. For the next 12 seconds, you become blind and deaf to your own senses as your mind experiences the minute that led to that blood being spilled, from the point of view of the one whose blood was spilled.

        <name>Path of Destruction (Path of Blood (HB))</name>
        <text>Beginning at 14th level, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points while you're raging, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and make a single melee weapon attack.
	As part of the same reaction, you may also spend a hit die to heal yourself. If you choose to do so, roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1).
