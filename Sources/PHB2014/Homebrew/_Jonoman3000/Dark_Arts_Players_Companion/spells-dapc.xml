    <text>You animate droplets of your own blood to act under your command. For every three hit points spent in the casting of this spell, you create a droplet of animated blood
	As you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter, you can mentally command the droplets to move as long as they are within 120 feet of you. The droplets have a speed of 30 feet, and a climbing speed of 15 feet.
	As an action on your turn, you can choose to see and hear from the location of one of the blood droplets until the end of your turn, becoming blinded and deafened to your own surroundings. Additionally, you may instead use your action to cause one of the droplets to explode in a burst of necromantic energy, destroying the droplet and damaging surrounding creatures. Each creature within 5 feet of the droplet must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d4 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

Hemomancy:
You must spend a number of hit points during the casting of the spell. Spending hit points in this way causes you to take necrotic damage equal to the amount spent, which cannot be reduced through any means. The number of hit points you can spend is based on the spell's level, and is shown in the table below. You may not use temporary hit points to cast hemomancy spells.

Hemomancy Spell Table:
Spell Level | Minimum Cost | Maximum Cost
1st | 1 | 10
2nd | 4 | 15

5th | 13 | 30
6th | 16 | 35
7th | 19 | 40
8th | 22 | 45
9th | 25 | 50

When you cast a spell with the hemomancy tag, you must spend a number of hit points that is between the minimum and the maximum amount you can spend. For example, if you are casting a spell of 2nd level, you must spend at least 4 hit points to cast it, though you can choose to spend up to 15 hit points in order to increase the power of the spell.

    <text>You create a 15-foot radius sphere of shadow magic centered on a point within range. The area appears to be wreathed in swirling shadows and darkness, and is easily identifiable when it is in an area of bright or dim light. The sphere spreads around corners, and each creature that ends their turn within the area becomes invisible. This invisibility ends for a creature if they attack, cast a spell, or leave the area. Anything they are wearing or carrying is also invisible as long as they are.

An unconscious creature wakes up after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, or if another creature uses its action to shake them awake. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

During the casting of the spell, you can make a Charisma (Deception) check against the target's Wisdom (Insight) check to attempt to conceal the spell's true nature, such as pretending to bandage their wound.
	The curse has no effect until after 1 hour. Thereafter, the curse lasts for a number of days equal to the number of hit points spent, and for that duration the cursed creature can't regain hit points and is poisoned. Every 8 hours the creature is cursed, they take 3d4 necrotic damage as the curse rots away at them.

You must spend a number of hit points during the casting of the spell. Spending hit points in this way causes you to take necrotic damage equal to the amount spent, which cannot be reduced through any means. The number of hit points you can spend is based on the spell's level, and is shown in the table below. You may not use temporary hit points to cast hemomancy spells.

Hemomancy Spell Table:

6th | 16 | 35
7th | 19 | 40
8th | 22 | 45
9th | 25 | 50

When you cast a spell with the hemomancy tag, you must spend a number of hit points that is between the minimum and the maximum amount you can spend. For example, if you are casting a spell of 2nd level, you must spend at least 4 hit points to cast it, though you can choose to spend up to 15 hit points in order to increase the power of the spell.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you bury a humanoid hand into a patch of loose earth at least 5 feet in diameter to conceal it. The area is nearly undisturbed and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
	The hand animates when a medium or smaller creature walks over the area of earth. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the spell could be set to affect aberrations or drow),
or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the spell, such as those who say a certain password.
	When the hand animates, it attempts to grab whatever creature triggered it. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and become restrained as the hand grasps it with an inhumanly strong grip. The creature can use an action on its turn to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success. Once the hand has animated for 1 minute, the spell ends, and the hand returns to normal. If the creature dies while restrained, the hand pulls it underground, burying it.

    <text>You draw out a portion of your blood, infecting it with a vile poison before causing it to streak towards creatures within range. As you cast this spell, you must spend a number of hit points, allowing you to target 1 creature for every 5 hit points spent. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d8 necrotic damage and is also infected for the duration. On a success, the target takes half damage and suffers no additional effect. An infected target is poisoned, can't regain hit points, and whenever they take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, they take an additional 2d8 necrotic damage as they bleed profusely. A creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

    <text>This spell dominates the minds and bodies of humanoids, consuming them in a frenzy of death. As you cast the spell, you must spend a number of hit points. Roll 14d8 and add twice the number of hit points spent to the roll; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Humanoids within 30 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).
	Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is under your control until the spell ends. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this spell.
	On each of your turns, you can issue commands to the creatures under your control, directing them where to move and attack. If a creature doesn't receive orders from you, they attack the closest creature to them. If a creature hasn't made an attack by the end of its turn, the spell ends for them.
	If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, each creature that is still under the spell's effect when the spell ends dies.

	A creature remains a swarm for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

    <text>You cause a creature of your choice to be overtaken by exhaustion. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains a level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature suffers no effect and the spell ends. At the start of each of their turns, the creature must repeat the saving throw. It gains a level of exhaustion on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. The spell ends early if the target's exhaustion level becomes 4 or greater.

    <text>Choose up to 4 creatures within range. Each creature has their shadow forcibly ripped from their body, conjuring a Shadow (Monster Manual pg. 269) in an unoccupied space next to them. As long as the shadow is separate from their body, they do not cast a shadow. A shadow created through this spell reforms with its host when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends, and it disappears if its host dies. If its host dies, a new shadow does not rise from the corpse.
	The shadows seek only to attack the creature they were separated from, and disappear when that creature is killed. Roll initiative for the shadows as a group, which has its own turns. They spend their turns attacking their host, without any thought for strategy or tactics.
	The DM has the creature's statistics.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using certain higher level spell slots, you can target more creatures: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.

    <text>You draw out a portion of your blood, forming it into a rope that you can use to either pull yourself to a location, or pull an object or creature to you. As you cast the spell, you must spend a number of hit points. Then, you immediately send the rope to grab a target that you can see within a range equal to 5 times the number of hit points spent. Once you grab a target, you can either pull yourself to a location within 5 feet of the target, or you can attempt to pull the target to a location within 5 feet of you. In order to pull the target to you, it must weigh less than 100 pounds, and if it is a creature it can make a Strength saving throw to avoid being pulled. If you pull yourself to a target, you move in a straight line towards the target and take opportunity attacks as normal.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of weight you can pull increases by 100 pounds for each slot level above 2nd.

Hemomancy:
You must spend a number of hit points during the casting of the spell. Spending hit points in this way causes you to take necrotic damage equal to the amount spent, which cannot be reduced through any means. The number of hit points you can spend is based on the spell's level, and is shown in the table below. You may not use temporary hit points to cast hemomancy spells.

Hemomancy Spell Table:
Spell Level | Minimum Cost | Maximum Cost
1st | 1 | 10
2nd | 4 | 15
3rd | 7 | 20
4th | 10 | 25
5th | 13 | 30
6th | 16 | 35
7th | 19 | 40
8th | 22 | 45
9th | 25 | 50

When you cast a spell with the hemomancy tag, you must spend a number of hit points that is between the minimum and the maximum amount you can spend. For example, if you are casting a spell of 2nd level, you must spend at least 4 hit points to cast it, though you can choose to spend up to 15 hit points in order to increase the power of the spell.

    <text>You transform your blood into a 10-foot-radius protective dome that forms around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The dome can be damaged, and it has a number of hit points equal to 20 + double the amount of hit points spent in the casting of this spell. Any creature within the dome cannot be targeted by creatures outside the dome, and vice versa. Spells and attacks that would pass or extend through the dome instead hit the dome, dealing it damage, and do not extend farther. As long as the dome lasts you can use your action to spend a number of hit points and add this amount to the dome's current hit points.
	Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it.
	The dome is semi-transparent. It can be seen through, but things seen through the walls appear distorted and blurred with the red color of the dome.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the dome's base hit point value increases by 5 for each slot level above 4th.

You may choose to spend a number of hit points, and you may also gain the hit points needed from corpses within the radius, not including those of constructs, elementals, and undead. Each corpse that had a hit point maximum greater than or equal to 5 in life gives 5 hit points towards the casting, and then cannot be used to cast this spell again.
	As a bonus action on your next turn, you can release the blood. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 4d6 + the number of hit points gained or spent as necrotic damage. On a successful save, they take half as much damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

	While in this form, the target has an AC of 18, its only method of movement is a walking and climbing speed of 20 feet, and it cannot jump or otherwise remove itself from the surface it moves on. This movement is completely noiseless, and allows the target to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down on ceilings. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. It has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and is always hidden in darkness. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains on the surface it was on even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.
	While in the shadowy form, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast spells.

Any creature that starts its turn next to a wall must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 bludgeoning damage and become restrained. The creature can make a Strength saving throw at the start of each of its turns, taking the same damage on a failure or freeing itself on a success.
	The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 10 and 20 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it.
