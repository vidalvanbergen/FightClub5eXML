        <name>Multiclass Berserker</name>
        <text>To multiclass as a Berserker, you must meet the following prerequisites:
 • Strength 13

You gain the following proficiencies
	• Light armor, all vibroweapons</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Rage</name>
        <text>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
   While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

	• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
	• When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a berserker, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Berserker table.
	• You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.

   If you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
   Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your berserker level in the Rages column of the Berserker table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</text>

        <name>Marauder Approach</name>
        <text>Few things are more terrifying than being in the path of a Berserker who has learned the ways of the Force. Those who follow this path unlock something deep within them, a well of untamed power from the depths of their fury. When a marauder unleashes their rage, they channel their brute strength into primal might, and uses it to devastate his foes in a hail of fire, blades, and blood. Due to the uncontrolled nature of their powers, marauders have a dangerous predilection for the strength and raw power offered by the dark side, and many fall into it's clutches. Even those who do not are always temped by the voices of fury barely contained within.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Marauder Approach: Forcecasting</name>
        <text>When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you have derived powers from your primal connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.
Force Powers Known:
   You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

Force Points:
   You have a number of force points equal to your berserker level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

Max Power Level:
   Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

Forcecasting Ability:
   Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier

Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier</text>
      </feature>
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Marauder Approach: Furious Force</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, you can cast force powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from force powers you cast. If a force power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of the targets.

Casting force powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage.

If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.
Area Reading: As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent.

        <text>During your training you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

Tech Powers Known:
You learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer class table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

Tech Points:
You have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer class table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

Max Power Level:
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer class table.

You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

Techcasting Ability:
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Tech save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +your Intelligence modifier

Tech attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +your Intelligence modifier

Techcasting Focus:
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or your tool proficiencies granted by this class as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.

        <text>When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

Force Powers Known
   You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

Force Points
   You have a number of force points equal to your fighter level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

Max Power Level
   Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

Forcecasting Ability
   Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice).

You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.

Saving Throws
Some of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Important Note:
*Fight Club 5 only uses standard Fifth Edition Skills, so we have mapped the skills in Star Wars 5e that are different this way.

	• History = Lore
	• Arcana = Technology
	• Religion = Piloting

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background

	• (a) a martial lightweapon or vibroweapon and a light or medium shield or (b) two martial lightweaponss or vibroweapons
	• (a) combat suit and light shield or (b) light battle armor
	• (a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack

Variant - Starting Wealth:
In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:

        <name>Forcecasting</name>
        <text>In your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the guardian class table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your guardian level x 2, as shown in the Force Points column of the guardian class table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the guardian class table.

You may only cast force powers at 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier

Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier</text>

Focus save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)

        <text>When you choose this Order at 3rd level, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

Force Powers Known
   You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Aing-Tii Order Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

Force Points
   You have a number of force points equal to your monk level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Aing-Tii Order Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

Max Power Level
   Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Aing-Tii Order Forcecasting table.

   You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

Forcecasting Ability
   Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier

Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier</text>

        <text>When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you have derived powers from your emotional connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

Force Powers Known
   You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

Force Points
   You have a number of force points equal to your operative level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

Max Power Level
   Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

Forcecasting Ability
   Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf.

Some of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Grapple Technique save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

Constrict
   You attempt to choke the target into unconscious-ness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.

If you maintain this technique for 1 minute, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this way.

Disarm
   You attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

Hip Toss
   You attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.</text>

Some of your trick shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Trick Shot save DC: = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

Blinding Shot:
   You attempt to blind the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.

Brutal Shot:
   You attempt to knock the target prone. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Hampering Shot:
You attempt to hobble the enemy's movement. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, its movement speed is reduced by half and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.</text>

Side Effects
d20	Side Effects
1	The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1.
2	The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze.
3	The creature's legs become swollen. Their move speed becomes at most half their normal movement speed.
4	The creature becomes one size larger or smaller.
5	The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC.
6	The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
7	The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.
8	The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead.
9	The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage.
10	The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.
11	The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.
12	The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage.
13	The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft.
14	The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare.
15	The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.
16	The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion.
17	The creature believes they are the chosen one.
18	The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved.
19	The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage.
20	The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree.</text>

5	The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC.
6	The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

9	The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage.
10	The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.
11	The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.
12	The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage.
13	The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft.
14	The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare.
15	The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.
16	The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion.
17	The creature believes they are the chosen one.
18	The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved.
19	The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage.
20	The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree.</text>

Side Effects
d20	Side Effects
1	The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1.
2	The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze.
3	The creature's legs become swollen. Their move speed becomes at most half their normal movement speed.
4	The creature becomes one size larger or smaller.
5	The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC.
6	The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
7	The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.
8	The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead.
9	The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage.
10	The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.
11	The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.
12	The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage.
13	The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft.
14	The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare.
15	The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.
16	The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion.
17	The creature believes they are the chosen one.
18	The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved.
19	The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage.
20	The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree.</text>

Side Effects
d20	Side Effects
1	The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1.
2	The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze.
3	The creature's legs become swollen. Their move speed becomes at most half their normal movement speed.
4	The creature becomes one size larger or smaller.
5	The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC.
6	The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
7	The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.
8	The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead.
9	The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage.
10	The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.
11	The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.
12	The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage.
13	The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft.
14	The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare.
15	The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.
16	The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion.
17	The creature believes they are the chosen one.
18	The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved.
19	The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage.
20	The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree.</text>

Side Effects
d20	Side Effects
1	The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1.
2	The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze.
3	The creature's legs become swollen. Their move speed becomes at most half their normal movement speed.
4	The creature becomes one size larger or smaller.
5	The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC.
6	The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
7	The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.
8	The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead.
9	The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage.
10	The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.
11	The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.
12	The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage.
13	The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft.
14	The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare.
15	The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.
16	The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion.
17	The creature believes they are the chosen one.
18	The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved.
19	The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage.

Side Effects
d20	Side Effects
1	The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1.
2	The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze.
3	The creature's legs become swollen. Their move speed becomes at most half their normal movement speed.
4	The creature becomes one size larger or smaller.
5	The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC.
6	The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
7	The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.
8	The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead.
9	The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage.
10	The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.
11	The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.
12	The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage.
13	The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode.

The decoy appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The decoy is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion. For the duration, you can cast tech powers as though you were in the decoy's space. Both your decoy and the target of your tech power must be within your line of sight.

You can use your bonus action to cause the decoy to move up to 30 feet. As your decoy changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the decoy. If your decoy is ever more than 120 feet away from you, it immediately disappears.

Additionally, when both you and your decoy are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the decoy, but is not aware it is an illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.

A creature that uses its action to examine your decoy can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

Max Power Level

Forcecasting Ability

You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability.

	• Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced walls or barriers.
	• Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
	• While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
	• When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

You can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you immediately break the bond with your current spirit.

Generating Your Spirit
   Your spirit might be the ghost of a benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit.
   
   Additionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack and damage rolls.

You and your spirit can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.
