        <name>Academic Superiority</name>
        <text>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to apply your studies in practical ways known as maneuvers. Your maneuvers are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

Maneuvers:
You know two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the scholar class table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.
	Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

Superiority Dice:
You have two superiority dice, which are d6s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar class table. This die changes as you gain scholar levels, as shown in the Academic Superiority column of the scholar class table. A superiority die is expended when you use it.
	You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

Saving Throws:
Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Maneuvers:
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order at the end of the class.</text>

Your medication and treatments are known to be untested and unstable. Immediately after you use a maneuver that causes a creature to regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, you can choose to roll on the Side Effects table to the right. The condition or effect lasts until the creature completes a long rest, or you use this feature again.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Side Effects:
d20 | Side Effects
1 | The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1.
2 | The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze.
3 | The creature's legs become swollen. Their move speed becomes at most half their normal movement speed.
4 | The creature becomes one size larger or smaller.
5 | The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC.
6 | The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
7 | The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.
8 | The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead.
9 | The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage.
10 | The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.
11 | The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.
12 | The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage.
13 | The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft.
14 | The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare.
15 | The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.
16 | The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion.
17 | The creature believes they are the chosen one.
18 | The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved.
19 | The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage.
20 | The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree.</text>

Side Effects
d20	Side Effects
1	The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1.
	2	The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze.
	3	The creature's legs become swollen. Their move speed becomes at most half their normal movement speed.
	4	The creature becomes one size larger or smaller.
	5	The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC.
	6	The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
	7	The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.
	8	The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead.
	9	The creature gains +4 to perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage.
	10	The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.
	11	The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.
	12	The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage.
	13	The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft.
	14	The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare.
	15	The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.
	16	The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion.
	17	The creature believes they are the chosen one.
	18	The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved.
	19	The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage.
	20	The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree.</text>

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you, and it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that an officer givers her gun to the first smuggler she meets. If the condition isn't met before the effect ends, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the effect ends.

        <text>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

Tech Powers Known:
You learn 4 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

Tech Points:
You have a number of tech points equal to half of your scholar level (rounded up), as shown in the Tech Points column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

Max Power level:
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table.
	You may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

Techcasting Ability:
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Tech save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

	Tech attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Techcasting Focus:
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.</text>

        <name>Beast Companion (Zoologist Pursuit)</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to forge a powerful bond with your own personal beast companion.

Choose your beast, which is detailed in the Expanded Content or at Star Wars 5e.com. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of herbs and food to call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your companion.

If your beast dies, or you want to bond with a different creature, you must first break the bond with your current beast companion. You may only have one beast companion at a time.

Your beast gains a variety of benefits while it is bonded to you:

The beast obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast acts on its own.

Your beast's level equals your scholar level, and for each scholar level you gain after 3rd, your beast companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.

Your beast has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.

Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your beast's abilities also improve. Your beast can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your beast can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.

While your beast is the target of your Critical Analysis feature, it gains a bonus to ability checks, armor class, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up).</text>
