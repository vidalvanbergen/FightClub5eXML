      <name>Clone Characteristics</name>
      <text>The basic Republic Clone is bred for obedience and military discipline.

Though often viewed as the "Flesh and blood" equivalent of Battle Droids, most Clones possess a limited capacity for individuality. They were bred for no other purpose than combat, but nevertheless they developed as individuals under the guidance of their Jedi officers. The Jedi's unique abilities and leadership prowess earned them the admiration and respect of the Clones who served under them, and as such allowed Clones to develop a more individual mindset.

Republic Clones are genetic replicas of the Human Species. Specifically, they are based off of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, and as a result they are almost indistinguishable from one another.

Homeworld: The vast majority of Republic Clones are created on Kamino by the Kaminoans.

Languages: Republic Clones all learn Basic.

Example Names: When a Republic Clone is created, they are assigned a two letter and four digit identification tag, although those that survive multiple deployments tend to take up a moniker to better identify themselves.

Adventurers: All Republic Clones received basic training in core military skills, such as weapons handling, marksmanship, drill, and other essentials. As such, the vast majority of Republic Clones become Soldiers, with a rare few becoming Scouts and Technicians.

      <name>Echoes of The Original </name>
      <text>Your mind isn't completely your own or, at least, it wasn't always yours. As you are a clone of another living being typically the life experiences of the original host have been suppressed or wiped. Do to the brain wash program of order 66, you experience echoes from another life.

Intrusive Echoes. Immediately after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, your minds memories emerge and overtake your perceptions and experiences. You might see people around you as someone other than who they are, or you become disoriented by a double-experience of the world around you.

These echoes grant you knowledge, talents, or even languages you can't always explain, but they also intrude on your perceptions and beliefs unexpectedly. They will last for 1d12 rounds in combat or hours of provoked out of combat.
	Roll on or choose an option from the Echoes table to determine the nature of this Gift.

Additionally, you gain the traits that follow.

Echo Table:
d6 | Echo
1 | My mind is with that of another clone elsewhere, perhaps on another world.
2 | I have lived many times before, my mind compiling experiences each time a clone from the same host dies creating an amalgam of thoughts and personality.
3 | My consciousness is an exact replica of the original being I believe I am he/she.
4 | I was physically and mentally merged with two separate body and minds. As such I am a unique combination. (Imperial or Sith experimentation)
5 | I share my body with an intangible, otherworldly mind, a non corporeal being.
6 | Time fractures around me, and I sometimes collide with my originals past or future.

Roll on the Intrusive Echoes table to determine the effect of these vivid memories and perceptions. Once one of effects occur, these intrusive echoes can't manifest again until you finish a short or long rest.

Intrusive Echoes Table:
d6 | Effect
1 | You are charmed by a creature you can see (of the DM's choice) for 1 minute or until the creature damages you.
2 | You are frightened by a creature you can see (of the DM's choice) for 1 minute, or until the creature damages you.
3 | You perceive another time or place around you until the end of your next turn. During this time, you are blinded to your actual surroundings.
4 | You perceive a different time or place overlapping your surroundings. Your speed is halved until the end of your next turn.
5 | Memories and sensations overwhelm you. You are incapacitated until the start of your next turn.
6 | Your memory is one of triumph. You can reroll the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that you just made. You must use the new roll.</text>
