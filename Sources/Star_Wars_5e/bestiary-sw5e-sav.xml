    <description>Manufactured by Atgar SpaceDefense Corporation, the 1.4 FD P-Tower is a light laser cannon employed as a fixed emplacement anti-vehicle weapon. It is designed to target a variety of enemy vehicles, including repulsortanks and landspeeders, although it has difficulty targeting fast-moving vehicles. The unit is quick to produce and inexpensive.

The main bulk of the weapon is a 2.8 meter high energy dish that has sixteen micropower routers spaced evenly along the outer edge, and eight power conversion cells along the interior of the dish. Targeting sensors are placed on the upper edge of the dish, and a single light laser cannon emanates from the center of the dish. To re the weapon, energy is fed directly into each micropower router which holds the charge until the ring computer registers that the Energy Conversion Point had been achieved. The power conversion cells around the dish glows once the weapon is primed to fire. At that point, the ring computer channels the energy from the routers into the main power converter located at the center of the dish, ring the weapon. The energy beam moves through the discharge barrel, into the galven circuitry and through the focusing lens to produce a low-power beam that is effective against repulsorcraft, landspeeders, and airspeeders.

The 1.4 FD P-Tower utilizes an Atgar C-6 battery, which only retains enough power for eight shots before needing to be replaced. The battery is easy to replace when handled by a skilled technician. When hooked up to a power generator, the weapon has unlimited fire capability. The weapon also suffers from a low fire rate, and requires ten seconds to build up an adequate charge.

The visible dish was also a tempting target for opponents, although the weapon itself is protected by light armor plating.

    <description>The 74-Z speeder bike is a model of speeder bike manufactured by the Aratech Repulsor Company. It is commonly used for reconnaissance missions as well as rapid transportation in combat zones.

They were capable of reaching speeds up to and beyond five hundred kilometers per hour, and had a flight ceiling of twenty-five meters. 74-Zs were the military variant of the civilian 74-Y. They were controlled by handlebars located towards the front of the vehicle, and foot pedals slung underneath adjusted speed and altitude.

The highly maneuverable vehicles were equipped with sensor and communications devices located between the handlebars, including a comlink and a comlink-jamming device. The speeder was equipped with terrain-following sensors that linked up with the HUD in the driver's helmet. They were armed with a forward rotating blaster cannon for combat.

They were also equipped with a very powerful boost that could propel them over vast distances in a shorter amount of time. In addition, the 74-Z was stripped down to just its fundamental components, namely the engine and steering vane, in order to increase its overall speed, and as such a single, scaled-down, forward-facing blaster cannon was fixed on the undercarriage.

    <description>The Armored Assault Tank, also known as the AAT battle tank or the AAT-1 Hover Tank, was a tank vehicle used by the Trade Federation[4] and later donated to the Confederacy of Independent Systems where it served as one of its backbone infantry defenses and backbone vehicles during the Clone Wars. Many of the AATs used by the Confederacy were painted in Confederate colors, such as blue, however there were still tanks used by the CIS in the previous tan used by the Trade Federation. The tanks were also donated to Death Watch during their alliance with the Confederacy.

      <text>Admiral Gilder is able to analyze a target, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on his turn, he can analyze a target he can see within 120 feet of him. For the next minute, or until he analyzes another target, he gain the following benefits:</text>
      <text/>
      <text>When he analyzes a hostile creature, attack and damage rolls made with vibroweapons wielded in onehand or blaster weapons against that target may use his Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.</text>
      <text/>
      <text>When he analyzes a friendly creature, the target may use its reaction and end your Critical Analysis to add 5 to 1 attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Discovery</name>
      <text>Admiral Gilder's studies have helped him discover new practices he can apply to his skills. He knows the following scholar discoveries from the SW5e Player's Handbook:</text>

    <description>Massive, winged cetaceans, the aiwha were native to both the oceans and skies of the planet Kamino, capable of both swimming and flying using their wingtips to propel them through either substance. Their long, beak-like mouths featured a baleen used for filtering krill from seawater. The non-sentient species, one of a wide variety of aquatic life on Kamino, was also known as the "air whale", and were a peaceful and majestic species. Aiwha gave out bleating cries when dying.

History. When the climate of Kamino changed drastically, leading to planet-wide flooding when the ice caps melted, the native Kaminoans adapted both themselves and some of their fellow creatures to their new environment. The aiwhas were among those who were adapted using the Kaminoans' advanced cloning technologies, and became biological curiosities used as mounts to traverse Kamino's endless ocean. The Kaminoans used aiwhas as mounts, although aiwhariders traveled beneath the waters during the lashing tempests of the severe electrical storms which raged for much of the planet's year.

    <description>Anoobas were aggressive pack predators native to Tatooine. Opportunistic hunters as well as scavengers, these wolflike canines would attack virtually anything smaller than themselves (such as scurriers) and would band together in packs to bring down rontos, eopies, and similar creatures.

Strong, horny beaks on their jaws assisted in the breaking of thick skeletons, while long, tufted tails helped to counterbalance the body and dissipate heat. Anoobas could vary in weight from 20 to 45 kilograms —males being larger than females—and often banded into packs of ten to twelve. These units were dominated by an alpha male and alpha female, and it was not uncommon to see entire packs waiting alongside podrace courses for an easy meal.

Like the winged urusai, accounts tell of anoobas being so engorged on meals that they are unable to move. This may be due in part to the fact that anooba mothers fed their young, born three to four at a time, through regurgitation.

Domestication. Anoobas were also known to be, like the massiff, domesticated by Tatooine's Tusken Raiders as pets and guard animals.

Off-World. Packs of escaped, adaptable anoobas imported from Tatooine roamed Coruscant alleys looking for prey. As a result, nocturnal foot traffic in certain areas was highly risky. Anoobas on Coruscant were known to howl at the planet's moons. Anoobas were sometimes caught in packs and used as gladiatorial fighting animals, for which they were given a shock collar to control their behavior.

    <description>The All Terrain Armored Transport is an imposing, heavily armored, quadrupedal combat walker that stands 22.5 meters tall and can move at 60 kph. In addition to it's armaments, it also served as transport for combat personnel. The vehicle's cockpit and sensor array are located in the "head" of the walker, which also carries spotlights and the main armaments: dual Piperii-Cerlurn R-90C medium blasters located on the sides or "temples," and a pair of heavier Taim &amp; Bak MS-1 heavy blaster cannons fitted on the "chin." The main body houses a troop compartment capable of ferrying numerous soldiers, along with a vehicle bay at the walker's rear that holds five 74-Z speeder bikes. The main, troop hatch is located in the middle of the walker's side, two smaller escape hatches are located both to the main hatch's immediate left and right, and the auxiliary hatch is located in the walker's underside.

    <description>The All Terrain Recon Transport (AT-RT), is a one-man bipedal walker used for reconnaissance and patrolling made by Kuat Drive Yards as part of their All Terrain series. It is equipped with a single seat for a pilot, as well as a repeating blaster cannon and mortar launcher, and is 3.2 meters tall and 2.9 meters long.

Also known as the Republic scout walker, the AT-RT was used mainly during the Clone Wars by Advanced Recon Force troopers. It was the precursor to both the All Terrain Defense Pod and the All Terrain Scout Transport. During the Galactic Civil War, these walkers were adopted by both the Galactic Empire, who used Scout troopers to man the vehicles, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who upgraded them to compete with the advancements of the Empire.

The AT-RT's were usually used for a variety of missions including ground support, police support, civil defense, and post-battle cleanup efforts. They occasionally took up position on the front lines of ground battles when difficult terrain prevented the use of larger vehicles.

    <description>The All Terrain Scout Transport (or AT-ST), also known as the chicken walker for its two-legged design, is a bipedal walker used by the Galactic Republic during the late Clone Wars and, later and more extensively, by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.

AT-STs are commonly used to screen the flanks of larger assault walkers for major ground operations. The Empire used them for swift reconnaissance and troop support. As such, they are essential for cleaning up minor resistance along the path of a planned invasion route, and can quickly eliminate small threats that evade an AT-AT's barrage. The walker is commonly used on anti-personnel hunting missions, and is piloted by two AT-ST drivers.

Despite its speed and agility, an AT-ST walker's offensive and defensive power are significantly compromised. Offensively, its weapons systems are only good against lightly armored targets at close range. Defensively, its lighter armor can repel attacks from small-arms fire, but not laser cannons, missiles, or other heavy ordnance. Its armor does not cover its entire frame, lest the walker lose its agility. Striking the walker's unprotected gyros underneath the command module can destabilize the walker and cause it to fall. Additionally, deep trenches or cable lines leveled at the height of the AT-ST's ankles and knees can cause it to trip and topple the vehicle.

The modular design of the AT-ST allows for ease in customizing the walker with armaments and tools for specific mission parameters such as mortar launchers attached to the command pod.

    <description>The All Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE), is an all terrain assault walker developed for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. The walker is used for transporting platoons of troopers and attacking enemy installations. The AT-TE's cramped rear compartment contains computer hologram communication devices and space for troopers to stand during transportation. On the back end of the machine is a large door for quick deployment of troopers. Some versions of the walker were able to scale vertical cliffs. The typical arsenal includes a top-mounted mass-driver cannon, along with six other laser cannons placed strategically around the outside of the vehicle.

    <description>An autoturret is a blaster turret emplacement used to defend an area. Known for their killing power and effectiveness, they are employed by many factions throughout galactic history.

Autoturrets were used widely during the Jedi Civil War, with the Sith Empire deploying them to restrict access to the Undercity of Taris and to defend their military bases. Often, they were installed at the entrances to hidden bases, onboard capital ships, or near personal valuables.

In the later stages of the Clone Wars, portable autoturrets were used by both the Grand Army of the Republiic and the Separatist Droid Army for covering fire or to reinforce the defense of field command posts. These autoturrets became the standard equipment of clone and droid snipers, who were entrusted with their deployment.

    <description>Sentry guns come in a wide variety of di􀃠erent sizes, yields, and types. These weapons can typically be found near high-value areas such as detention cells, command centers, and laboratories. For best results, they are placed in areas such as corners, above security doors, or other positions that a􀃠ord them a wide eld of re. Sentry guns are usually linked to the central security system, but can be operated manually by remote. Once activated, these turrets may use active sensors and preprogrammed criteria to identify threats and re upon any hostiles they encounter. Sentry guns are also used on starships and may automatically engage nearby hostiles and are linked to the ship's central security system. Some sentry guns include targeting sensors that seek out energy signatures from enemy weapons, with built-in computers to determine which targets pose the most immediate threat.

    <description>The B'omarr Order, which consisted of the B'omarr Monks, was a mysterious religious order that moved to the planet Tatooine around 700 BBY. The B'omarr believed that cutting themselves off from all physical sensation would further their studies, and allow them to ponder the galaxy and achieve enlightenment. When a monk became enlightened, his brain was removed through a special procedure, and was placed in a nutrient-filled jar. The brains were held in very high regard by the lower, embodied monks, who saw to their every need, though the brains rarely did anything other than think and wonder. When they did need to travel around their monastery on Tatooine, the brains were transferred into specially modified BT-16 perimeter droids.

    <description>B1 battle droids, also referred to as standard battle droids, are the most widely-used battle droids manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata and Baktoid Armor Workshop and were the successor to the OOM-series battle droids. The B1 battle droid sees extensive service as the mainlines soldiers due to their cheap, mass produced nature. The B1-X model serves as an officer unit.

History. Early versions of the model required the use of a Central Control Computer, but despite these weaknesses they saw extensive service as the mainlines soldier of the Trade Federation's mechanized droid army. Despite their limitations and despite battle droids being outlawed under the Empire, B1 battle droids continued to see use through Separatist holdouts and the black market during the Imperial Era.

    <description>Banthas are a species of large, hairy mammals with sharp, spiraling horns. They inhabit the desert planet Tatooine, though they are bred on many worlds throughout the galaxy. They are social herd animals, and are often domesticated, and used prominently, by Tusken Raiders as mounts and companionship. Although the Tusken Raiders never kill Banthas for their food or hide, they are utilized by many other species for products such as Bantha steak, butter and clothes or furniture.

Biology and Appearance. Banthas are quadrupedal mammals that average in height 2 to 2.5 meters. An adult's average weight is 4,000 kilograms, and they have extensive shaggy fur, which is brown or black in color. Both females and males of the species have a pair of spiraling horns that extrude from their skull and grow at a knob a year. Banthas possess a wide mouth, bright, inquisitive eyes, and a large tail which drags on the ground as they walk. They have wide, flat feet with four digits.

Pop Culture. "Bantha fodder" (or "Bantha poodoo" in Huttese) is a phrase used as the equivalent of "worthless"; a person or thing deemed to have no value beyond something for a bantha to graze on, because of bantha food's unpleasant smell. "Not give two bantha ticks (about something) meant to not care in the slightest (about something or someone), "Son of a bantha" was an insult, and "A wild bantha chase" meant a futile errand.

    <description>The Battle Hydra is a type of large reptilian dragon-like Sithspawn that was created by the Sith Lord Exar Kun. They are known to have two heads that sit atop long, fluid necks. The heads hold a pair of yellow slitted eyes. There were some varieties of these beasts that have more than two heads.

Behavior. When left to their own devices, these beasts are mindless and shy creatures-a sharp contrast to their fearsome appearance. Battle hydras are known to be solitary animals that hunt alone. They spend most time aloft where they ride thermal currents in search of prey or threats. When prey is spotted, the battle hydra dives through the air, snapping with multiple jaws as well as their poisoned stinger. Once prey succumbs to either the attack or poison, the beast takes the corpse back to its lair where it is torn apart and devoured.

These animals are, however, susceptible to influence or commands from Force-sensitive dark side users. Many of battle hydras have been used as personal shocktroopers for these dark-lords. Battle hydras are known to be particularly attracted to sites that are strong in the dark side of the Force. It is believed that perhaps these beasts draw some form of nourishment from these locations.

    <description>The BB-series astromech droid was a model of astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton and active during the era of the cold war, featuring a spherical body that allowed the droid to roll in any direction, with a head usually atop the body but not meant to be permanently physically attached to it (which would inhibit the droid's ability to roll around). Like earlier astromechs, the BB unit could fit into the droid socket of a starfighter.

    <description>Personality &amp; Traits. Bendu was a wise and enigmatic being which resembled a giant rocky monolith with two eyes, a flat nose, and a long beard. He was a powerful entity who could control nature, including the krykna spiders of Atollon. Bendu could also sense the presence of other Force-wielders from a distance. He was a wise and patient teacher who believed that other Force-sensitive beings needed to learn to overcome their fears and imbalances through personal trials.

Powers &amp; Abilities An immensely powerful being who possessed incredible connections to the Force and could perceive the emotions of others, he also had the power to appear and disappear at will.

The exact nature of the Bendu remains a mystery, but whether he is an exceptionally potent wielder of the Force or a literal avatar of its many mysteries, the possibility of other beings like him existing should not be overlooked. A Bogan who represents the cruel, the cold and the hateful dark side, and an Ashla standing for the compassionate, the warm, the serene light side.

    <description>Black Sun held a massive amount of reach and influence, extending its tendrils of corruption deep in the various galactic governments of each era. It was infamous for its involvement in piracy and smuggling. But smuggling was just the tip of the iceberg of the galaxy-wide organization. It was involved in every known type of illegal activity; its information networks surpassed even the accuracy and scope of Imperial Intelligence. The resources available to Black Sun rivaled those belonging to a large planetary army, including foot soldiers.

Below the leader of Black Sun were nine Vigos (Old Tionese for "nephew"). Each Vigo ruled over his or her own territory and sector.

    <description>Blurrgs were a two-legged non-sentient species that were used as beasts of burden on a number of worlds located across the galaxy, including Endor, Ryloth, and Zygerria. Stoic and strong, they are used for everything from agricultural labor to war; the Twi'lek Resistance on Ryloth rode blurrgs in battle during the Battle of Ryloth, where they were used at the final offensive against Separatist forces in Lessu, charging at droid troops with the Grand Army of the Republic's Lightning Squadron.

The blurrg's huge mouth could chew through almost anything edible, which made it perfect for clearing savanna grass, weeds, and saplings. Blurrgs were strong, fast , but stupid—so much so that they walked right into small trees, knocking them down. The egglaying creatures usually produced 5 or 6 babies at a time. In their early years babies stayed very close to their mothers for protection from Boar-wolves. Blurrgs communicated through a series of roars. They are also vicious when driven to a fury, and are reputedly noisy when agitated.

Mounts. Rothana Heavy Engineering sold blurrgs as mounts to Imperial forces. They cost 12000 credits for six or 20000 credits for a herd of 12.

    <description>Bogwings are a reptavian species found on the planets of Naboo and Dagobah. During the Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire, bogwings were also seen in the swamps of the ruins of Taris.

Biology. Bogwings are known to be able to carry nine times their own weight and are very territorial. There are two races of bogwings: the greater bogwing and the lesser bogwing. They both feed on small creatures dwelling in the canopy, but the greater bogwing feeds in the upper levels, while the lesser bogwing feeds in the lower levels where it avoids larger predators such as the jubba bird.

Naboo. During Gulliball games played by Gungans, bogwings were released into the sky to signal halftime.

      <text>The bor gullet can establish a psychic link with any creature that it successfully grapples with its tentacles. Until the psychic link ends, the bor gullet can perceive everything the target senses. The target is aware that its mind is linked, and the bor gullet can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so with a successful DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the bor gullet are more than 1 mile apart, with no consequences to the target. The bor gullet can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.</text>

The bor gullet can also make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target contests this attempt with a Wisdom (Insight) check. If the bor gullet succeeds, the mind believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target.</text>

    <description>Bor gullets are a non-sentient, tentacled species found in the galaxy. They have the unique ability to read minds, with the unfortunate side-effect of causing insanity. As a result, they were often used as a form of torture. Notably, Saw Gerrera's Partisans owned a bor gullet, and Harra the Hutt had collected a bor gullet in her menagerie on the planet Vodran.

If it wins the contest, the brain worm burrows into the target's brain and takes control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the brain worm has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The brain worm retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Geonosian, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including force powers, tech powers, and languages. If the host body takes 20 points of cold damage in a single round, the brain worm must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw using its own Constitution score, not the host's. On a failure, the brain worm leaves the body, slithering out to a space within 5 feet of the host. After exiting the host, it is paralyzed until the start of its next turn. If the host body dies, the brain worm must leave it. The brain worm is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a master heal force power. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the brain worm can voluntarily leave the body, slithering out to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it.</text>

    <description>Brain worms are worm-like parasites from Geonosis that have the capability of controlling minds. They hatch from yellow eggs, and are known to have been used by the Geonosian Queen Karina the Great during the Clone Wars on her Geonosian minions. The worms would sometimes enter the host via the nose, and were able to control dead Geonosians.

Brain worms react negatively to cold temperatures.

    <description>The C1 series astromech droid, was a model of C-series astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton. They were used during the Clone Wars and the reign of the Galactic Empire, though by then they were considered antiques and had passed their manufacturer's expiry date a few decades prior. They had three mechanical arms to manipulate objects with, and featured an electrical arc welder.

    <description>A cantina, also known as a saloon, bar, or pub is a place where spacers, smugglers, and other denizens of the nearby area come to drink and play board and card games, such as pazaak or sabacc. Cantinas are located on almost every major planet and are often a center of criminal activity such as smuggling and spice trading.

Many cantinas provide live entertainment in the form of musicians, dancers, or fighters. Gambling is also popular in these locales. The main attractions, however, are the beverages served by mixologists or automixers, and the opportunity to meet friends or business associates (illicit or otherwise).

Cantinas are generally poorly lit and crowded. They are dangerous centers of criminal activity, and it is not uncommon for patrons to be maimed or killed within the walls, without so much as a flinch from the staff or the other patrons. Sometimes, however, things can get out of hand.

    <trait>
      <name>Villainous Hit Points</name>
      <text>Cyborg Khagan has multiple pools of hit points, each of which is tracked separately. Damage and healing only applies to the currently active hit point pool. When a pool is depleted of all hit points, it becomes inactive. Only one pool can be active at any time. If a hit point pool is depleted, the Cyborg Khagan immediately saves against all ongoing conditions and effects. Any abilities which can reset do so. If all pools of hit points are inactive, Cyborg Khagan is killed. If Cyborg Khagan takes a long rest, it fully heals the currently active pool and fully heals one depleted pool.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Villainous Exhaustion</name>
      <text>Cyborg Khagan rolls initiative with advantage. Cyborg Khagan starts with a number of villainous actions equal to one less than it's villainous multiplier. If a hit point pool is depleted, Cyborg Khagan also loses one villainous action. Cyborg Khagan may use a villainous action after any other creature takes a turn. If Cyborg Khagan does so, it regains its reaction. A villainous action is a complete turn. They have an action, bonus action and may move up to their full speed. The villainous actions refresh at the start of Cyborg Khagan's turn and any remaining actions from the previous turn are lost.</text>

    <description>Kaleesh were reptilian humanoids from the planet Kalee. They had scaly skin, tusks, and long nostrils, though few outsiders ever saw a Kaleesh face that wasn't obscured behind a traditional mask. Kaleesh culture was deeply spiritual and warlike. War was seen as an essential part of life, and wars between tribes were common.

BROTHERS OF THE KOLKPRAVIS

The Kolkpravis were a large united band of Kaleesh tribal warriors from the eastern hemisphere of the planet Kalee. The organization of the kolkpravis was naturally tribal, as well as the names. The beginning rank of the kolkpravis was a warrior, who made up a kamen. Kamen was lead by a blackarm. Roughly 100 kamen made up a horde, which was lead by a tarkhan. Around 100 to 200 hordes made up a brigade which was lead by baatars.

From several brigades came a khanate' which was lead by one of the eight khans of the Izvoshra. The Supreme Commander of the kolkpravis was the khagan, a title held first by Qymaen jai Sheelal, the infamous Lord Grievous.

    <description>While most Jedi would lose their solid form and become one with the Force upon their death, some had learned a technique to retain their own identities separate from the Force for a time. Those individuals could linger in the physical world in the form of "Force Spirits," nonphysical entities that exhibited most traits and abilities they had in life. According to the knowledge contained in Asli Krimsan's holocron, that feat could be achieved by sublimating one's organic cells into a state of pure energy.

In its "normal" state, a Force Spirit could only interact with other noncorporeal entities. In order to be heard or seen by the living, the Spirit had to manifest itself. There were different types of manifestation. On a basic level, a Force ghost could appear as a floating, milky gray mass of energy that lacked distinctive features. But it could also manifest itself as the exact image of the dead being during their lifetime, only transparent and emitting a bluish glow. While it could appear to anyone it wished, a spirit could not choose to become audible or visible to only some beings and not the others, since the ability to perceive the manifestation depended on the beholder's strength in the Force. While many Force ghosts could appear as a vision of their former selves unmarked by injury or disease, others still bore the marks of what killed them.

Normally, force spirits could neither harm nor be harmed by physical entities, due to their spiritual nature. For the same reason, they could pass through solid matter effortlessly and were never hampered in their movements. While some spirits would simulate the walk of the living beings, subject to gravity, others would hover and drift above ground level. However, in some cases, a spirit could acquire temporary solidity by drawing on a living creature's link with the Force, which allowed it to actually touch the material world for a time. A manifested spirit could wield Force powers, although not all of them. It also had the ability to travel instantaneously to any point in the galaxy by force of will, as long as the spirit was familiar with that place.

    <description>Death troopers were an elite variant of stormtroopers designed for stealth, espionage and lethality. Operating under Imperial Intelligence, they served as protective details and bodyguards for significant Imperial officers as well as special-assignment commandos. Death troopers were trained in unarmed combat, heavy weapons, demolitions, and marksmanship. They were experts at covering their tracks, leaving little to no evidence of their missions.

Stormtrooper candidates who excelled at their training were reassigned to the advanced death trooper camp on Scarif. They were required to exceed traditional stormtrooper standards, including height and weight, and had to meet certain ideological standards. The candidates were also subjected to a battery of physical tests and classified surgical enhancements as well as more rigorous training than standard stormtroopers.

They wore black suits of armor that was much more advanced than standard stormtrooper armor. Their helmet had vocal scramblers, micro-motion sensors, targeting systems, and heads-up displays with data on enemy and friendly positions on the battlefield to give them total situational awareness. Their armor was also covered by a spray polymer called reflec, which warped electromagnetic signals commonly found in sensor arrays, making them well suited for stealth operations. Death troopers were equipped with a variety of weapons depending on their specialities including the SE-14r light repeating blasters, E-11Ds, DLT-19D heavy blaster rifles, C-25 fragmentation grenades and Sonic Imploders.

    <description>Destroyer droids, also known as Droidekas or rollies, are a type of heavy battle droid originally crafted by Colicoids. It has a reputation for deadliness due to its resilience and firepower, as well as the fear it can instill in even the most powerful Jedi. They are also used for executions. Destroyer droids are equipped with dual built-in blaster cannons and a built-in deflector shield generator. Due to their ponderous nature, destroyer droids have a ball-form that they can transform into, granting them great speed.

    <description>Dewbacks were large, four-legged, omnivorous, cold-blooded reptiles native to the Dune Sea of Tatooine. As such, they were well-adapted to the harsh desert climate. This and the fact that they could be easily domesticated made them commonly employed as beasts of burden by both the inhabitants of the desert planet and the off-worlders wandering its dunes.

Behavior. While they had a reputation for being solitary animals, wild dewbacks were also known to roam the seemingly endless deserts of Tatooine in single-file packs of two to five, searching for food and moisture during the day. To retain warmth and conserve energy, the dewbacks huddled together at night. The dew that accumulated on their backs during the night was both a source of moisture in the morning and the origin of the species's name.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Adult dewbacks stood at 1.3 to 2.1 meters in height and could reach lengths of 2 to 3 meters. Though most of them were green, dewbacks with red, brown, gray and most rarely blue scales were known to exist. It was common for these scales to have a mottled or camouflage pattern to them. The special melanins contained within a dewback's hide, which cut down on the glare from the twin suns of Tatoo I and Tatoo II, preserved vital fluids and gave it the ability to go days without water and endure the extreme heat.

Mounts. Dewbacks were sold by Rothana Heavy Engineering to be used as mounts by Imperial troops. They were bundled in a herd of six animals and cost 16000 credits.

    <description>Manufactured by Golan Arms, the DF.9 is a fixed emplacement anti-infantry weapon. It incorporates a single DF.9 laser cannon mounted atop a four-meter tall cylindrical housing composed of heavily-armored durasteel, with proton-shielding that is resistant to close-quarters blaster fire. The tower features a front access panel, and an upper observation hatch.

The turreted laser cannon employs precision targeting computers and has an optimal range of three kilometers, although the laser cannon is capable of hitting targets at a distance of sixteen kilometers at the cost of decreased accuracy. The DF.9 is capable of firing a shot every three seconds, with the impact of the energy beam scattering explosive energy and producing a secondary blast of radiation with an eight-meter radius impact point that can effectively destroy entire squads of soldiers. Skilled gunners can use the DF.9's accuracy to effectively disable army support systems and light vehicles, and it is devastating to foot soldiers and a threat to vehicles such as the All Terrain Scout Transport.

The DF.9 is best used in conjunction with other similar units and anti-vehicle lasers to defend military bases, spaceports and other strategic installations. It can be installed on multiple terrain types. The nature of the DF.9's fixed emplacement means that the unit is not able to be moved easily.

    <description>Dianoga were large cephalopods, capable of growing up to ten meters in length, though most specimens grew to approximately five or six meters. They had a single eyestalk protruding from their mollusk-like bodies, and seven suckered tentacles surrounding a fanged maw containing a sharp serrated probe.

Their bodies would become transparent when unfed, and, conversely, were known to change to reflect the color of the food they had eaten. This was achieved by diverting small portions of digested food into a series of ducts underneath the creature's skin, which would appear to affect the color of the dianoga's flesh.

Over many millennia, dianoga migrated from Vodran by stowing away aboard garbage ships in their microscopic larval forms, and could be commonly found in trash compactors, garbage pits, and sewers across the galaxy, living off any present organic matter. They were primarily scavengers, and only posed a threat to living creatures when starving or threatened. Because of their penchant for living in and feeding on organic waste, dianoga were sometimes referred to as garbage squids, sewage squids, or trash monsters.

Smaller dianoga were known to crawl out of toilets. Despite this, they could prove useful, since they served to rid waste of biological material, leaving behind salvageable minerals and metals. Only when a dianoga grew too large was it usually considered a threat, especially in urban areas. However, the presence of a single dianoga was often cause for alarm, since the creatures were self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, and could quickly multiply to pose a larger problem.

    <description>Living in the murky waters of swamp-covered planets such as Dagobah and Nal Hutta, the dragonsnakes were large serpentlike beasts with sharp fangs. Although voracious, they were incapable of digesting metal. They hid under the muddy water, waiting for their next meal to come close enough. After snatching its prey, a dragonsnake would then dive back under the water.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Dragonsnakes were well armored with razor fins, and had rows of sharp fangs in their mouths. They used their wide tails to propel them through their watery habitat; their long arms were mostly used for digging or grasping. In mass, they could be up to 50,000 kilograms. The dragonsnake was a patient predator, usually lying in wait under the water until its prey wandered too close to the water's edge. Lashing out with fins and fangs, the dragonsnake would drag its victim underwater, coiled in its body, until it drowned.

Only a few fellow Dagobah creatures posed a threat to dragonsnakes as their scales were durable enough to withstand most melee and vibroweapons and even small arms fire. Dragonsnakes were known to fight the monstrous swamp slugs of Dagobah. Even if devoured by the giant beasts, dragonsnakes could gnaw through the swamp slug's stomach and burst out of its belly. Dragonsnakes rarely mated more often than once every ten standard years, with females laying one to six eggs. These were buried and abandoned, usually resulting in consumption by predators. Hatchlings achieved full size within months and were adults.

A breed of dragonsnake that resided on Nal Hutta differed greatly in its physiology, notably lacking arms and long external ears. Their body was covered in bioluminescent nodules, giving them a similar appearance to the Colo claw fish of Naboo.

History. At some point during the pan-galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars, the Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos attempted to track down Ziro the Hutt on Nal Hutta. During the mission, Kenobi was attacked by a local dragonsnake. The creature was killed when the Jedi Master thrust his ignited lightsaber in the dragonsnake's head.

In 3 ABY, the aspiring Jedi Luke Skywalker accidentally landed in the middle of watery peat bog on Dagobah. A hungry dragonsnake that hid there snatched Skywalker's astromech droid R2-D2, mistaking him for a living organism. Upon realizing that its prey was inedible, the dragonsnake forcefully spat out the droid, who survived the encounter unscathed.

    <description>The DSD1 dwarf spider droid, also known as the burrowing spider droid because it was first used to destroy opposition in narrow mine shafts, is a battle droid manufactured by the Commerce Guild to support the cause of the Separatists, and also used to punish customers who decline to pay their taxes to the Commerce Guild.

Characteristics. The DSD1 is similar in function to a typical combat vehicle. Its main weapon is a long central blaster cannon mounted on its dome that is capable of firing either rapid anti-personnel rounds, or slower high-intensity blasts that can destroy light vehicles. The droid's small frame and four all-terrain legs make it suitable for warfare in dangerous mines, and the adjustable legs lets it attain better elevation for the blaster cannon. Its legs are able to walk straight up and down walls and narrow cliffsides. However, because of the fixed laser cannon, it can not turn around to track enemies, thus making it inferior to speedy targets. Also, the length of this cannon sometimes hinders it in confined areas.

Behavior. The droid communicates in a beeping language similar to Binary. It seems to have basic emotions, such as frustration. They do not do anything that they predict will harm themselves.

After the Clone Wars. Though most Separatist war vehicles were deactivated after the end of the Clone Wars, the dwarf spider droids were recommissioned through Imperial command and used by the Galactic Empire to enforce the submission of former Separatist worlds, fighting against the remnants of the very government that once used them, with the Stormtrooper Corps using the droids as their mechanical attack dogs. They would remain utilized throughout the Empire's reign, and it was not uncommon to see these droids alongside stormtroopers at Imperial checkpoints.

    <description>A DUM-series pit droid, manufactured by Serv-O-Droid, Inc., are used for labor, repair and light construction. In the center of their head is a large, round photoreceptor equipped with multi-spectrum scanners capable of detecting microscopic damage. Pit droids stand 1.19 meters tall but can compress themselves into a compact, box-shaped package. A tap on their photorecepter signals them to return to their upright position, and vice-versa. Their most remarkable feature is their immense strength, able to carry objects many times their own size or weight.

    <description>Energy spiders or spice spiders are arachnids that inhabit the spice mines of Kessel. They live in complete darkness inside the mine's caves spinning webs made of glitterstim, a rare kind of spice. When fed ryll, the energy spiders produce glitteryll and grow to large sizes. A number of the creatures have been smuggled onto Ryloth, which is one of the few other worlds capable of supporting them.

Behavior. The spiders shoot webbing from their mouths to capture prey, impale them and then quickly suck the life energy from them. The spiders are known to feed on bogeys, as they are sources of pure energy that caused the glitterstim to react and produce light, alerting the spiders to their presence. The spiders also disliked bright light, since they lived in pitch black caves. Energy spiders were, however, drawn to the light produced by the glitterstim-bogey interaction, and there are even cases of mistaking other lighting sources for this interaction. They are one of the many threats faced by the spice miners, especially those who wander too deep into the caves where the spiders lived. Often, the administrators and superiors on Kessel will send disruptive prisoners to work in these deep tunnels, ensuring an often permanent solution to a prisoner problem. As energy spiders feed on energy, blaster bolts are ineffective against them and are merely absorbed. Curiously, ion weapons, since they affect energy and its distribution, are highly effective (but not lethal) against them.

    <description>The exogorth, colloquially known as the space slug, is a gigantic species of toothed gastropod.

Biology. They are silicon-based lifeforms that survive in the vacuum of space by making their homes in the caverns and craters of asteroids. The average adult space slug grows to about 10 meters in length. Space slugs reproduce asexually by fission. Once an adult slug reaches a about 10 meters in length, a chemical trigger causes it to split apart into two identical but smaller slugs. Occasionally, this mechanism is overridden, and the slug grows to monstrous sizes that rival capital ships in sheer bulk, with some weighing over a million kilograms.

Travel. A space slug travels through the asteroid fields they inhabit by pushing off the surface of one asteroid and floating through space to land on another. They also use stellar winds to help propel themselves through space. Through highly evolved sense of spatial awareness, they are capable of calculating the trajectory and distance of perilous moving bodies around them. This sense of spatial acuity also aids them in hunting food.

Feeding. They feed on the minerals of asteroids, various stellar energy fields, mynocks (another silicon-based lifeform), ships, and other unfortunate creatures that unknowingly pass into its mouth. They are able to anchor themselves into a cave in an asteroid with tendrils, which also draws nutrition directly from the asteroid itself. Although their primary diet, similar to Mynocks, is passive radiation, they tend to chomp on rocks and metal as well. On occasion, a naturally occurring chemical trigger causes the space slug to kill whatever is near them. Colossal slugs are known to take sizable bites out of capital ships that pass too close to the slug's current dwelling, and even swallow smaller vessels whole. At these sizes, the mynocks they eat will often become internal parasites, rather than nourishment, living inside the cave-like esophagus of the slugs that ate them. Some slugs have entire ecosystems of other life living within their digestive tracts.

Variations. Giant space slugs are larger than average ones. It remains unclear if they were a separate species from the common space slug, or just individuals larger than normally reported.

Crimson slugs are native to the asteroids of Tapani sector and distinguished by a red stripe down either side of the body.

Cularin space slugs are found in the Cularin system and are comparatively easy to train. Some theorize that they are descended from a domesticated form of space slug. Other theories hold that these exogorths are descended from natives to the world which formed the Cularin system asteroid belt (Oblis) before its destruction, and that these creatures survived and adapted to the void of space. They may have been related to—or the same creature as—the space worms which hollowed out the moon Eskaron.

    <description>The exogorth, colloquially known as the space slug, is a gigantic species of toothed gastropod.

Biology. They are silicon-based lifeforms that survive in the vacuum of space by making their homes in the caverns and craters of asteroids. The average adult space slug grows to about 10 meters in length. Space slugs reproduce asexually by fission. Once an adult slug reaches a about 10 meters in length, a chemical trigger causes it to split apart into two identical but smaller slugs. Occasionally, this mechanism is overridden, and the slug grows to monstrous sizes that rival capital ships in sheer bulk, with some weighing over a million kilograms.

Travel. A space slug travels through the asteroid fields they inhabit by pushing off the surface of one asteroid and floating through space to land on another. They also use stellar winds to help propel themselves through space. Through highly evolved sense of spatial awareness, they are capable of calculating the trajectory and distance of perilous moving bodies around them. This sense of spatial acuity also aids them in hunting food.

Feeding. They feed on the minerals of asteroids, various stellar energy fields, mynocks (another silicon-based lifeform), ships, and other unfortunate creatures that unknowingly pass into its mouth. They are able to anchor themselves into a cave in an asteroid with tendrils, which also draws nutrition directly from the asteroid itself. Although their primary diet, similar to Mynocks, is passive radiation, they tend to chomp on rocks and metal as well. On occasion, a naturally occurring chemical trigger causes the space slug to kill whatever is near them. Colossal slugs are known to take sizable bites out of capital ships that pass too close to the slug's current dwelling, and even swallow smaller vessels whole. At these sizes, the mynocks they eat will often become internal parasites, rather than nourishment, living inside the cave-like esophagus of the slugs that ate them. Some slugs have entire ecosystems of other life living within their digestive tracts.

    <description>Large non-sentient amphibians native to Naboo and Onderon, biologists surmise that both the fambaas and the falumpasets of Onderon were originally brought there by Naboo merchants, but there is little fossil evidence to back up that hypothesis. Their only known predators are sando aqua monsters breaching the surface of the swamp.

Biology. Fambaas obtain food by knocking over trees to get at leaves and berries. They also forage for underwater plants, breathing underwater and swimming with ease. Fambaas reach sizes of up to 9 meters. Females lay large numbers of sticky, gelatinous eggs, which they deposit in puddles and underwater. The young hatch with moist skin and gills, and upon maturity, the gills disappear and their skin hardens.

Herds. In the wild, fambaas travel in herds of up to twelve, but form breeding herds of hundreds of family units that are so large they are traditionally put to pasture in sacred swampy areas. There are also special fambaa stables contained inside the underwater hydrostatic bubble-enclosed cities for the domesticated breeds kept by Gungans.

Domestication. The fambaa have been domesticated by Gungans for millennia as beasts of burden and cavalry/artillery draft beasts, sometimes carrying portable deflector shield generators or large booma cannons.

    <description>Apex predators, Fexian skullborers inhabit the trees of the mostly unexplored purple moon Fex in the Sha Qarot system of the Deep Core, and are semi-sentient or sentient.

Feeding. The species feeds by drilling holes into the skulls of their prey via their long snouts and feeding off the victims' brains. The skullborers drop down from trees and latch onto their prey to initiate feeding.

Appearance. The skullborers are small and light in weight. The creatures have six spindly limbs, each ending in clawed fingers, that radiate from a central body having a neck holding a large skull, ringed with eight eyes evenly spaced across it. The skull has a large snout with an outer layer of skin and an inner, translucent feeding tube. Between the two layers of the snout is a ring of bone covered by a layer of crystalline teeth with a hardness similar to diamond. The teeth ring is connected to a muscular system at the junction of the snout and skull that allows the teeth to rotate, allowing the skullborers to cut through a variety of tough substances to feed, including heavy armor and polycarbonate. The skullborers have rigid and sharp spines on their back in four rows of four that contain toxins to poison those who touch the spines. Despite having light-weight, thin bones, the skullborers' skeleton is very strong.

Camouflage. They species also possesses an active, full-body camouflage that hides them from the naked eye. However, if a skullborer falls unconscious or dies their camouflage dissipates, revealing skin that radiates color at the touch.

    <description>Flesh Raiders are a species of mutated soldiers who originally served the Infinite Empire. Originally lower-caste members of the Rakata species, they were mutated and bred by the Infinite Empire by the thousands as soldiers. By the time of the Cold War, some Flesh Raiders survived on the planet Tython.

Biology &amp; Appearance. The Flesh Raiders are extremely primitive and violent. Bulky bipedal humanoids, Flesh Raiders have razor-sharp teeth, which they used to strip the bones of both sentient and non-sentient prey. Eight small olfactory slits line their upper lip and two stumpy eye stalks protrude from the sides of their box-shaped heads.

History. The origin of the Flesh Raiders is lost to history and they do not appear to keep records. From what little study of the creatures the Jedi Order was able to perform, the Flesh Raiders appear to have evolved from a more civilized society that devolved into their primitive and cannibalistic forms after the other colonists of Tython disappeared. Another theory is that the aforementioned society was attacked by the Sith and subjected to bizarre experiments which reduced them to maddened hostiles.

Society &amp; Culture. Having no established cities or formal government, the Flesh Raiders are tribal and erect temporary shelters on the Tythos Ridge. Flesh Raiders practice a form of spiritual worship: shamans have been seen inside their small settlements. Preferring naked earth, the Flesh Raiders scour the land they chose to occupy, burning away grass and trees and littering the earth with the bones of their prey. The raiders use signal fires to communicate over great distances.

    <description>Flutterplumes were feathered carrion-eaters native to the planet of Ord Mantell, but also had a sizable population on Alderaan. The enormous scavenger bird was noted for its impressive hook-like beak and four sets of curled talons that it used to tear apart and consume rotting carcasses. Its beautiful feathers were also valued as good luck charms. An abundant supply of fresh battlefield kills attracted flocks of these carrion eaters and there were stories of wounded men unable to defend themselves being eaten by the hungry winged predators. Flutterplumes hunted in flocks of three or four, gliding on the thermal currents that blew across the planet

Each creature there must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) sonic damage and be flung up to 60 feet in a direction away from the line. If a thrown target collides with immovable object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) kinetic damage for every 10 feet it was thrown before impact. If the target would collide with another creature instead, that other creature must succeed on a DC19 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</text>

    <description>When the Force is strongly out of balance in a particular region, a Force Storm may form. Most Force Storms consisted of significant and violent weather patterns, while some were occasionally accompanied by volcanic or seismic activities. Force Storms could be caused by powerful presences in either the light or dark sides of the Force, the arrival of many Force-sensitives on the planet, or the death of many Force-sensitives all at once. The eye of a force storm may be temporarily neutralized, greatly diminishing the effects of the storm for a short while. However, only the resolution of the imbalance in the Force can truly stop a Force Storm once started.

    <description>Gamorreans were a sentient species of green-skinned porcine humanoids that hailed from the Outer Rim planet of Gamorr.

Biology &amp; Appearance. A species of tall, strong bipeds, the Gamorreans have porcine traits, like an upturned, large-nostriled cartilaginous snout, jowls, and upturned tusks. Their hulking bodies are covered in green, thick and hairless skin. They have ve digits on every extremity, each sporting a hard nail. The digits of their hands include an opposable thumb, which allows the Gamorreans to easily grasp and handle objects. The species has two sexes: the males, referred to as boars, and the females, called sows.

Society &amp; Culture. Gamorreans have a clan-based society. Each clan is ruled by a female leader, the Clan Matron, and a male leader, the Warlord, although the Gamorrean society is, at heart, a matriarchy. Indeed, a Warlord holds his position by way of marriage to a Matron rather than force, although Matrons make their selections based on the boars' combat skills. Gamorreans see war as glorious, and violent clashes between clans are rife.

Because of their low intelligence, Gamorreans tend to be both stubborn and loyal; philosophically, they believe that any problem can be solved by hitting it with brute force. They have a language of their own that sounds like mere grunts and squeals to outsiders. Although they can understand other languages, such as Galactic Basic, they nd most of them too difficult to pronounce.

Technologically speaking, the Gamorreans are primitive, and they favor melee weapons like vibroaxes and vibrolances over blasters. They did not discover space travel on their own. Moreover, Gamorrean boars fail to maintain personal hygiene, rarely changing their clothes or wiping the streaming mucus from under their snouts.

Across the Galaxy. Offworld Gamorreans are a common sight, be they mercenaries or enforcers working for crime lords. They also colonized the planet Pzob in the K749 system and are the majority sentient species on Lanthrym in the Elrood sector.

    <description>Gamorreans were a sentient species of green-skinned porcine humanoids that hailed from the Outer Rim planet of Gamorr.

Biology &amp; Appearance. A species of tall, strong bipeds, the Gamorreans have porcine traits, like an upturned, large-nostriled cartilaginous snout, jowls, and upturned tusks. Their hulking bodies are covered in green, thick and hairless skin. They have ve digits on every extremity, each sporting a hard nail. The digits of their hands include an opposable thumb, which allows the Gamorreans to easily grasp and handle objects. The species has two sexes: the males, referred to as boars, and the females, called sows.

Society &amp; Culture. Gamorreans have a clan-based society. Each clan is ruled by a female leader, the Clan Matron, and a male leader, the Warlord, although the Gamorrean society is, at heart, a matriarchy. Indeed, a Warlord holds his position by way of marriage to a Matron rather than force, although Matrons make their selections based on the boars' combat skills. Gamorreans see war as glorious, and violent clashes between clans are rife.

Because of their low intelligence, Gamorreans tend to be both stubborn and loyal; philosophically, they believe that any problem can be solved by hitting it with brute force. They have a language of their own that sounds like mere grunts and squeals to outsiders. Although they can understand other languages, such as Galactic Basic, they nd most of them too difficult to pronounce.

Technologically speaking, the Gamorreans are primitive, and they favor melee weapons like vibroaxes and vibrolances over blasters. They did not discover space travel on their own. Moreover, Gamorrean boars fail to maintain personal hygiene, rarely changing their clothes or wiping the streaming mucus from under their snouts.

Across the Galaxy. Offworld Gamorreans are a common sight, be they mercenaries or enforcers working for crime lords. They also colonized the planet Pzob in the K749 system and are the majority sentient species on Lanthrym in the Elrood sector.

    <description>A non-sentient, predatory, serpentine species native to the jungle swamps of the planet Rodia.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Ghests possess cartilaginous skeletons, a pair of bulbous, featureless eyes and a maw full of razor-sharp teeth. Their head is located at the end of a long, slender body, which is, on average, six meters in length. They possess slick skin, a tail, and four relatively thin limbs: two forelimbs and two larger hindlimbs, all ending in four thick, clawed digits. Where the forelimbs attach to the body beneath the head, the skin is particularly wrinkled.

The species reproduces sexually, and females can even extract and use sperm from dead male members of the species. Once fertilized, a female lays hundreds of eggs which will hatch into juveniles, which appear as tiny versions of their parents.

They are capable of extended hibernation.

Behavior. Ghests hunt large species of herbivore and can walk on their hind limbs while on land, but hunt and mate while submerged in water. Ghests swim slowly when hunting, keeping all but their eyes and forehead submerged below the surface. It is not unknown for ghests to attack small Rodian settlements, devouring all residents within a few hours. Ghests have no natural predators on Rodia.

Rodian Culture. Ghests hold an important place in Rodian myth and legend. Ancient Rodians believed that ghests, or swamp demons, captured the spirits of the dead; thus, sightings of the species were considered bad omens. Killing a ghest is sometimes believed to remove a curse, such as a drought or famine, so groups of male Rodians sometimes band together to ritually hunt down a ghest and kill it.

    <description>Gizka are small reptiles that can be found all across the galaxy.

History. Whatever their native world, their extraordinary reproduction rate led to a fair amount of gizka on many worlds, even including uncharted planets such as Lehon, finding their way from the wreckage of crashed starships. It has been alternatively postulated that they came from that planet originally, spreading along with the Infinite Empire. Their exponential population growth led to them being considered pests on almost as many worlds as they inhabited, as they commonly eat electrical wiring.

Culture. They are the source for the delicacy gizka steak. Some species of sentient carnivores, like Trandoshans, seemed to think that gizka were one of those kinds of animals that "everything tastes like."

    <description>Power droids are boxy droids with two or four legs that serve as mobile batteries, capable of powering a variety of machinery and vehicles. They are, effectively, power generators with legs and simple artificial intelligence so that they can understand rudimentary commands. They are most commonly found on underdeveloped worlds that do not have an expansive power grid, or in mobile (often military) operations.

They often make a low honking noise that sounds like the word "gonk," resulting in the nickname gonk droid or simply gonk. This form of droidspeak was referred to as "Gonkian."

Models. Notable power droid models included the EG-4 and EG-6 power droids produced by Veril Line Systems; the S9-series heavy power droid, a larger and more powerful version of the EG-6; the PLNK "plunk" power droid; and the popular GNK power droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton.

    <description>Gorax were a species of seldom-seen giant humanoids native to the mountains of Endor. They sometimes attacked the villages of the Ewoks, who were among the sentient inhabitants of the moon.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Adult Gorax were usually over six meters tall. Some specimens were recorded that were up to 30 meters in height. A Gorax's ocher skin is covered in thick, matted dark fur, except on the face, hands and feet. Its head features two forwardfacing eyes with bushy brows, a mouth full of sharp fangs, and slit nostrils. Its limbs terminate in four fingers, including an opposable thumb. All of these digits end in sharp nails. However, some variants are known to have three-fingered hands, and feet with two large toes. Their large ponted ears offered them a highly sensitive hearing.

Gorax have immense strength; they are capable of uprooting a large tree effortlessly with both hands.

Behavior. Gorax live in mountainous areas and rarely show themselves. Although they mostly behave like savage animals, they display a capacity to use objects as crude tools—for example, using an uprooted tree as a blunt weapon. Moreover, some wear crude pieces of clothing, like a sash made of furs and skulls, or a belted loincloth.

    <description>Gundarks are a fearsome anthropoid from Vanqor known as one of the most vicious, strong, and aggressive species in the galaxy.

Biology. These non-sentient creatures stand between 1 and 2.5 meters tall, with four powerful arms and large ears as wide as their head. Both their hands and feet end with opposable digits. Gundarks are covered in short brown or gray hair, but are birthed live with black coats of fur, and are able to fight almost as soon as they leave the womb. A gundark's hair lightens as it grows older and its large, bat-like ears began to enlarge until, at puberty, they reach the width of its head, hence the expression "strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark." These creatures are born with only two of its four adult arms, with the second pair emerging during adolescence.

Behavior. Though not quite as intelligent as sentient creatures, gundarks are advanced enough to use simple tools such as rocks and clubs. (In spite of this, the expression "gundark brain" is used as an intelligence insult.) They live in organized family units inside hollowed-out trees or caves. Several gundark families often live together as a tribe, working for their common survival. Gundark society is matriarchal, with the oldest and most cunning female ruling the tribe. Males build the tribal homes and defended them ferociously from all intruders, attacking anything that enters the vicinity of the nest. Female gundarks are usually hunter-gatherers, acquiring the food needed by the tribe and training the young gundarks who aren't old enough to go out on their own.

Gladiators. In gladiatorial arenas, a gundark is one of the most dangerous and feared opponents. Their short temper and thirst for blood means they will attack without provocation, even against opponents such as rancors or trompa.

Variants. There are several subspecies of gundark, including the Burskan gundark of Burska and an unidentified green subspecies with four equal sized arms, a tail ending in a pincher-like pair of claws, two toed feet, and a more reptilian appearance. Another sub-species was the Brachian Beastlord which is found on the moon Lamus. It is particularly vicious compared to main-line gundarks, and has a poisonous bite.

Some other species of carnivores are called gundarks, not because of physical resemblance but because of similarly vicious temperaments. These species include the long-necked gundark of Kharzet III and the aquatic gundark of Yavin 4.

    <description>Gutkurrs are a species of predatory insectoid carnivores native to the planet Ryloth.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Gutkurrs have both reptilian and insectoid characteristics. Their two-legged gait is very similar to that of a reptilian species, whereas their hard-shelled, spined carapace and sharp-mandible heads appear very insect-like. They ere approximately two meters high, and their tough hide and carapace are able to withstand several blaster shots. They are also carnivorous and very aggressive. They display little intelligence. They make a noise that sounds between a roar and a hiss.

Clone Wars. During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems deployed gutkurrs to attack Galactic Republic clone troopers during the Battle of Ryloth. Gutkurrs were resistant to blaster bolts and were said to be the second-most dangerous predator on Ryloth, the first being lyleks.

Distribution. Gutkurrs were found on the planet Ryloth and on the planet Onderon.

    <description>Hawk-bats are reptavian creatures with a curved beak and leathery wings that can be found on urbanized worlds like Coruscant and Taris.

Biology &amp; Appearance. The wingspan of a hawk-bat averages 1.5 meters. The wings consist of a thin membrane stretched over a series of wing-bones. The membrane itself is studded with spiky growths. The hooked beak of a hawk-bat contains tiny teeth that can tear prey to shreds, which they find with a combination of accurate eyesight and echolocation.

Young hawk-bats hatch from eggs, lack feathers, have green skin, and are fully independent. Upon reaching maturity, the hawk-bat sheds its green skin for a purplish-gray skin.

Behavior. Flocks of hawk-bats hunt and attack their prey as one. Though they favor granite slugs and shadowmoth larvae, hawk-bats will feed on anything that moves. Even large enemies can be taken down by a large flock of hawk-bats.

If one hawk-bat is disturbed, all of its companions attack the aggravator at once. They usually travel in large flocks through the pipes and lower levels of Coruscant. Every few months, they migrate despite lack of seasons within the lower levels. Hawk-bats hate the cold and usually stay away from it. Many live on power cables or in heated vents, hanging upside down from warm pipes below buildings.

    <description>Hive rats were enormous, nearly hairless, rapacious rodents who inhabited the sewers and lowest levels of Coruscant. The mutant rat species was often believed to be the result of ecosystem damage and exposure to sewage, pollution, and reactor radiation.

    <description>The hrumphs were powerful, thick-necked herbivores native to the Gungan swamps of the Mid Rim planet Naboo.

Hrumphs received their name from the loud, deep, guttural sounds they produced. They had four long horns for defense and for the protection of their two long, sensitive ears.

    <description>Hssiss, or dark side dragons, are a lizard species with the ability to influence Force-sensitive beings around them.

Biology &amp; Appearance. In appearance, Hssiss look like nothing more than particularly vicious reptiles, about three meters in length, with a green, scaly hide. In addition to those three meters, they have a meter long tail, covered in rows of spikes which stretch up past their backs and onto their necks. When in the lakes on Ambria, they hunt in pairs, grasping their prey with their strong jaws and sinking dozens of teeth into the unfortunate animal's body, while the other Hssiss sinks its jagged claws into it.

Abilities. Hssiss have a potent, venomous bite filled or powered by the Dark Side. Hssiss also have the ability to conceal themselves and become invisible, possibly doing so through the Force.

Origins. Hssiss originated as savage reptilian predators on Ambria, and were one of the few creatures to survive the planet's destruction. They lived in and near Lake Natth, where Jedi Master Thon had imprisoned the dark side energies that had plagued the planet for millennia. The dark spirits then began to possess the creatures, turning them into something much fouler—it is said that these "dark side dragons" aided those who used the dark side of the Force. Eventually, Great Bogga began to use them as body guards and pitted them against those who had failed him. When he realized how effective and vicious they were, he had them transported off-world and sold in bulk. Soon, Hssiss could be found all over the galaxy, especially on worlds where the dark side was strong, including Korriban, Mimban and Vjun.

    <description>Hutts are a large slug-like sentient species native to the planet Nal Hutta. They are well known as galactic gangsters whose Grand Hutt Council controlls the Hutt Clan crime syndicate.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Hutts have large mouths, stubby arms, and three lungs. They are tough and muscular with thick leathery skin, which is wrinkled and slimy. Their tails are supported by a skeletal spine. Despite their legendary adult size, Hutts start out as tiny Huttlets less than half a meter in height.

Their homeworld of Nal Hutta has a hot atmosphere and is frequently streaked by greasy rains, creating a fetid sauna in which Hutts are most comfortable. Hutts can live for centuries—Jabba was 604 when he was killed—and can grow to enormous sizes. Some Hutts suffer from a genetic defect that causes their skin to be bereft of pigment and prone to cracking.

Culture. Most Hutts are crime lords who live opulent lives overseeing criminal underworld activities like smuggling, slavery, gambling and bounty hunting in Hutt Space. They are typically obese, with the muscular Nar Shaddaa kingpin Grakkus being an exception.

The Hutt Clan is divided into families known as kajidics: Jabba's family was the Desilijic kajidic. Hutts bandage and bury their dead.

Classical architectural Hutt style can be seen on the planet Mataou. It is characterized by terraced buildings with sloping gates, and white and red colors.

Clothing is optional for Hutts, and some use live Sha'rellian toops as hairpieces. Hutts like to eat gorgs, slime pods and Klatooine paddy frogs, and are known to smoke hookah pipes.

Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu was a Hutt who ascended to godhood. To celebrate the deity's ascension, the celebration of Boonta Eve was created.

    <description>The Hyena-class bomber, also known simply as the Hyena droid bomber, Hyena Droid or Hyena bomber, was a droid bomber used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems as a heavy ordnance craft during the Clone Wars. The Hyena bomber also was used as a fighter, but only when needed.

The Hyena-class bomber is similar in design to the Vulture-class fighter, but has a broader fuselage and two "head" units. Unlike the Vulture Droid, the Hyena bomber's wings separate in the middle while in "walker" mode. The Hyena-class bomber is capable of carrying four proton bombs, six proton torpedoes and six concussion missiles inside the bomb bay beneath the hull. The Hyena bomber also carried two light laser cannons.

    <description>ID9 seeker droids, also called Parrot Droids or Mimic Droids, are a model of seeker droids that resemble the much larger Viper probe droids. The body of ID9 seekers consistsd in a half-hemisphere dome with a red photoreceptor. Attached to that dome are five articulated, tentacle-like limbs that end in pincers. The ID9s are outfitted with electro-shock prods that allow them to harm organic lifeforms and incapacitate mechanical beings. They are capable of imitating the sounds of other droid models, and have two locomotions modes: hovering and crawling.

    <description>After the InterGalactic Banking Clan secured Grievous's services as an enforcer, they refused to hire his Kaleesh, and thus the cyborg general demanded a cadre of "more intelligent battle droids" to serve him. The construction of the MagnaGuards was then commissioned for Grievous's service.

Constructed by Holowan Mechanicals, MagnaGuards were roughly two meters tall, with a humanoid body shape, but possessed a far-superior mechanical anatomy. This allowed for superhuman acrobatics, speed, and combat ability. Their internal systems were furnished with advanced combat learning programs, which, compared to most of the droids utilized by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, allowed the MagnaGuards to adapt to a highly diverse variety of tasks. These tasks ranged from melee and ranged combat to starfighter control. MagnaGuards were also capable of speech and were programmed to taunt their opponents in a low growling Basic.

The MagnaGuard's weapon of choice was the lightsaber-resistant electrostaff, and wore cloaks and head wraps similar to the garments of Grievous's old Izvoshra elite during the general's time as a Kaleesh warlord.

Grievous personally trained his bodyguards in the seven classic styles of lightsaber combat so that they could effectively engage and then kill Jedi. Grievous would not allow any repairs to be made to the droids, believing that their numerous scrapes and battle scars made them more intimidating to enemies.

    <description>The IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tank, also known simply as the hailfire droid or wheel droid, is a model of droid tank manufactured by Haor Chall Engineering that was used by the InterGalactic Banking Clan and Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars as well as the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War.

Able to roll rapidly into action, the IG-227 Hailfireclass droid tank is an armored missile platform easily identified by its treaded, hoop-like drive wheels 8.5 meters in diameter capable of moving it at intimidating speeds. Their light armor plating, brown and silver in color, made them fast at the cost of making them vulnerable to infantry attacks. Their red photoreceptor "eye" could lock on to both land and air targets at impressive distances, greatly improving the range of their missiles.

Hailfire droids are equipped with two racks of missile launcher pods on either side of their heads, each carrying 15 guided missile warheads that leave behind a trail of black exhaust when fired. These projectiles are especially effective against stationary or slowmoving targets on terrain where blaster weapons are unusable due to a lack of clear lines of sight. The missiles are most effective at ranges less than a kilometer and follow deliberately swerving, evasive trajectories. When the missiles are depleted, a hailfire droid is forced to rely upon its twin chin-mounted blasters.

    <description>The Emperor's Royal Guard, also known as the Imperial Royal Guard, the Imperial Guard or the Red Guard, is an elite unit whose members serve as personal bodyguards to the Galactic Emperor. Fully clad in crimson robes and face-concealing helmets, the Emperor's guards are a silent, imposing, and deadly force armed with force pikes. In addition to strict requirements of size, strength, intelligence, and loyalty, only the most skilled soldiers in the Imperial Military qualify for duty in the Royal Guard. The Imperial Royal Guard is also occasionally assigned to provide protection to members of the Imperial Ruling Council and even Lord Vader himself.

    <description>The Imperial Senate Guard is an elite unit of soldiers in the Galactic Empire. Stemming from the original Senate Guard of the Galactic Republic, the Imperial Senate Guard inherited the duty to protect senators and to accompany them as they traveled the galaxy. However, their true purpose is to ensure that the Imperial Senate remains loyal to Emperor Palpatine, the architect of the New Order. The Imperial Senate Guard's armor is blue-colored, and they are trained solely in melee combat, being equipped with cortosis sta􀃠s and personal energy shields that are powerful enough to deflect lightsaber attacks.

    <description>The Emperor's Shadow Guard is an organization of elite, Force-sensitive soldiers. Many suspect that they are former Jedi that have been captured, tortured, and brainwashed by Palpatine. They have been trained by Darth Vader. They were silent and enigmatic warriors that received orders directly from Emperor Palpatine himself and are often sent to eliminate suspected Jedi and other Force users. The Shadow Guards command a great level of respect within the Empire's ranks and often lead quartets of Imperial Stormtroopers into battle against the Emperor's most hated foes. Shadow Guard members are often guarded by their own detail made up of Imperial Navy Commandos or stormtroopers, or in certain cases, members of the standard Royal Guard,

    <description>THE INQUISITORIUS

Also known as the Order of Inquisitors, The Inquisitorious was an organization of Force-sensitive agents who worked for the Galactic Empire. Members of the Inquisitorius were known as Imperial Inquisitors, Inquisitors, Red Blades, Mystics by Imperial officers, and sometimes even Jedi hunters. They were tasked with hunting down the remaining Jedi who had survived Order 66 at the end of the Clone Wars.

INQUISITORS

The Inquisitors were all former Jedi that had turned to the dark side in someway or another, with the Grand Inquisitor having served as a Jedi Temple Guard and the Tenth Brother being the former Jedi Master Prosset Dibs. The Emperor's apprentice Darth Vader soon discovered the program and was put in charge of them. Vader trained the Inquisitors in the ways of the dark side of the Force. As part of their training, a number of Inquisitors had parts of their body severed by Vader's lightsaber so that they would not forget the lesson of loss and to learn to abandon the tendency to fight defensively as former Jedi and adopt more offensive moves.

Inquisitors also commanded Purge Troopers, which were elite death squads of clones. Due to the nature of their mission, Inquisitors had the power to commandeer any required Imperial Military forces, and all officers were to obey their orders. Any officer who came into contact with Force-sensitive beings was to immediately contact an Inquisitor to investigate the situation. Also, some Imperial officers disliked the interference of Inquisitors with some dismissing them as "mystics." When the Inquisitors became part of the Inquisitorius, they left behind their former names and took up new names, with Brother or Sister denoting their sexes.

    <description>THE INQUISITORIUS

Also known as the Order of Inquisitors, The Inquisitorious was an organization of Force-sensitive agents who worked for the Galactic Empire. Members of the Inquisitorius were known as Imperial Inquisitors, Inquisitors, Red Blades, Mystics by Imperial officers, and sometimes even Jedi hunters. They were tasked with hunting down the remaining Jedi who had survived Order 66 at the end of the Clone Wars.

INQUISITORS

The Inquisitors were all former Jedi that had turned to the dark side in someway or another, with the Grand Inquisitor having served as a Jedi Temple Guard and the Tenth Brother being the former Jedi Master Prosset Dibs. The Emperor's apprentice Darth Vader soon discovered the program and was put in charge of them. Vader trained the Inquisitors in the ways of the dark side of the Force. As part of their training, a number of Inquisitors had parts of their body severed by Vader's lightsaber so that they would not forget the lesson of loss and to learn to abandon the tendency to fight defensively as former Jedi and adopt more offensive moves.

Inquisitors also commanded Purge Troopers, which were elite death squads of clones. Due to the nature of their mission, Inquisitors had the power to commandeer any required Imperial Military forces, and all officers were to obey their orders. Any officer who came into contact with Force-sensitive beings was to immediately contact an Inquisitor to investigate the situation. Also, some Imperial officers disliked the interference of Inquisitors with some dismissing them as "mystics." When the Inquisitors became part of the Inquisitorius, they left behind their former names and took up new names, with Brother or Sister denoting their sexes.

They had long ears which they used for hearing, heat dissipation, and communication. These ears relayed the creatures' attitude. When alarmed, they would put both ears up; when curious, they would put one ear up and leave the other down; when all was well, they would simply leave both ears down.

    <description>Jawas were a sentient species of meter-tall humanoids native to the desert world of Tatooine. Jawas are thought by some to be giant rodents or devolved humans. Jawas had a musky, animal odor akin to a fraternity of wet rats.

Jawas were a communal species who spent most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts in search of any scrap metal, droid, or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement, where the dry climate of Tatooine preserved almost all debris. They had a reputation for swindling and for selling hastily refurbished equipment and faulty droids.

Each clan family had distinct territories for living and scavenging. Each clan was led by a Clan-Chief, who was male. However the overall operation of the Jawa clan was overseen by a female Shaman. A female Jawa became a shaman by either possessing some kind of Force ability with which to perform magic, overcoming an illness accompanied by a hallucinatory vision or was chosen and trained as the successor to the current Shaman.

    <description>JK-13 SECURITY DROID

The JK-13 security droid, unofficially known as the "Jedi Killer," is a JK-series security droid manufactured on the planet Ord Cestus.

Appearance &amp; Weaponry. The JK-13 is approximately chest-high and is divided into sections, giving it an insect-like appearance in its attack mode-so much so that the cave spiders, who used to rule Cestus, thought of them a natural enemy Its primary weapon is a set of stun tentacles extending from virtually every point on its body: these tentacles can be used to cut an opponent or deliver a disabling charge. Its primary defense is a deflector shield generator-like technology that allows it to absorb weapons fire before it even comes into contact with the droid itself.

Like all Cestus Cybernetics droids of its period, the JK-13 is unusually ornate and flexible, with a golden finish and enormous articulation of its tentacles, which can become a fine strand or thicker rope or cable as needed.

Bio Droid. The JK-13s are bio-droids: they use a living circuit design incorporating organics into the core processor, which is actually a life-support unit for a creature known as a dashta eel. Because the eels are Force-sensitive, they grant the droid some measure of precognitive abilities. This, in turn, grant it great combat ability. However, Dashta eels cannot kill another sentient being without going insane, meaning that the droids can never be deployed as general purpose combat units.

Availability. They sell faster than they can be produced, and cost 80,000 credits. They are assembled by Clandes Industrial in the city of Clandes.

    <description>Jubba birds are found on the planet Dagobah. They have purple and brown colored skin, with a yellow beak, two wings, a lengthy tail and a pair of spindly legs. Known for their soothing songs, they live in the planet's swamplands, where they use mud scooped from Dragonsnake Bog to make heavy nests that weigh down the trees they are built in.

    <description>Junk Droid, or Monster Droid, is the term used to describe any droid that is created by piecing together component parts of many other droids.

Though anyone with the know-how can cobble together a junk droid, they are most notably created by the various Jawa tribes on Tatooine. Because they mainly sell their wares to moisture farmers and small town businesses, Jawas know what peoples' needs are, and are able to create custom droids to meet the individual needs of any customer. Some junk droids are even made by themselves.

Because of their often mashed-together programming, they are considered dangerous by most civilized people, for they could go on a rampage, confuse orders, or even start building more of their own kind when having enough junk to do so.

Though no two junk droids are exactly the same, they are generally constructed in four classes:

• The Mechano-droid was a heavy labor unit
• The Tracto-droid was a mobile scanning/radar unit
• The Quad-pod droid was a cargo carrier
• The Rollarc droid was a multipurpose unit suited to variable tasks

Junk droids are sometimes sought after by eccentric collectors looking to find the most functional droid comprised the most incorporated parts that is the most pleasing to the eye.

    <description>K'lor'slugs are dangerous vermiforms native to the swamps of Noe'ha'on. They were also found on Korriban and Taris.

Biology &amp; Appearance. K'lor'slugs are large wormlike creatures that possess a serpentine body propelled by many dangerously-edged legs. The mouth is a gaping circular maw filled with concentric rings of teeth.

Behavior. K'lor'slugs are carnivorous hunters on their homeworld, possessing keen olfactory and visual senses in addition to a deadly venom. For reproduction, the creatures lay more than 300 eggs in a single birthing period. When hatched, the young k'lor'slug is immediately ravenous for food. In addition to their aggressiveness, these creatures are considered pests aboard starships. They are known to invade the darkest spots on unsanitary space vehicles and breed. When dealing with more than 300 eggs hatching, an infestation aboard a space vehicle could become harder to control—and more potentially fatal—the longer it is tolerated.

Cultural Impact. Because of their notoriety as an aggressive and deadly species, they are used as a holomonster playing piece in the popular strategy game, dejarik.

    <description>A katarn is a predatory quadruped reptomammal native to the planet Kashyyyk.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Katarns have slender bodies with rodent-like tails, and narrow faces leading back to a cartilaginous ridge protecting their neck and shoulders. Their paws have opposable digits, and their lower limbs are covered with sharp spurs, both of which allow them to climb and hang from the branches of the giant wroshyr trees and feed on tree-burrowers.

Wookiee Culture. Katarns are creatures of great importance in the Wookiees' culture. The Wookiees, who call the katarn the "Old Prince", hunt them in their hrrtayyk ceremony. Wookiees say the katarns were born by a wound to Kashyyyk that fell from the sky ages ago and made a home for the katarn. The katarns then hunted the Wookiees, thus unlocking the Wookiees' "inner fire". To thank the katarn, the Wookiees hunt them. They believe that someday it will be the katarn's turn to hunt the Wookiees again.

Some katarns are domesticated as the war-mounts of Wookiee dragon troopers.

Behavior. Katarns are ferocious and merciless predators thatd track their prey for long periods before choosing an opportune moment to strike. They have been described as "silent, shadowy, and deadly."

    <description>Kath hounds are about the size of a large dog, fur-covered, and each limb ends in four hoofed digits. They are generally not very hostile, unless provoked. At one point, the kath hounds started attacking the citizens of Dantooine and were blamed for numerous crimes, including the theft of a protocol droid. Kath hounds are also a popular pet for the crime lords of Nar Shaddaa, including Visquis and Vogga the Hutt. Domesticated kath hounds, called salkies, are also popular pets on Coruscant.

    <description>The Knobby white spider was a large landspeedersized arachnid-like organism native to the swamp world of Dagobah.

In addition to the very large ones, there are also some smaller, knee-heigh spiderlings.

Appearance. It had a large, lumpy body with a bloated, bulbous head, eight gnarled legs and one large stinger used to capture and sedate its prey.

Biology. One of the most bizarre organisms on Dagobah, the knobby white spider was in fact a mobile root that was part of the gnarltree's life cycle. Composed primarily of calcified wood, it would break free of its parent tree to roam the swamps and devour animals. After gathering enough nutrients, the spider would find a clear spot to anchor its legs, and if it survived that period, it would eventually transform into roots that allow the spider to grow into a towering tree. During this period it was vulnerable to bogwings and jubba birds.

    <description>KALEESH

Kaleesh were reptilian humanoids from the planet Kalee. They had scaly skin, tusks, and long nostrils, though few outsiders ever saw a Kaleesh face that wasn't obscured behind a traditional mask. Kaleesh culture was deeply spiritual and warlike. War was seen as an essential part of life, and wars between tribes were common.

BROTHERS OF THE KOLKPRAVIS

The Kolkpravis were a large united band of Kaleesh tribal warriors from the eastern hemisphere of the planet Kalee. The organization of the kolkpravis was naturally tribal, as well as the names. The beginning rank of the kolkpravis was a warrior, who made up a kamen. Kamen was lead by a blackarm. Roughly 100 kamen made up a horde, which was lead by a tarkhan. Around 100 to 200 hordes made up a brigade which was lead by baatars.

From several brigades came a khanate' which was lead by one of the eight khans of the Izvoshra. The Supreme Commander of the kolkpravis was the khagan, a title held first by Qymaen jai Sheelal, the infamous Lord Grievous.

    <description>KALEESH

Kaleesh were reptilian humanoids from the planet Kalee. They had scaly skin, tusks, and long nostrils, though few outsiders ever saw a Kaleesh face that wasn't obscured behind a traditional mask. Kaleesh culture was deeply spiritual and warlike. War was seen as an essential part of life, and wars between tribes were common.

BROTHERS OF THE KOLKPRAVIS

The Kolkpravis were a large united band of Kaleesh tribal warriors from the eastern hemisphere of the planet Kalee. The organization of the kolkpravis was naturally tribal, as well as the names. The beginning rank of the kolkpravis was a warrior, who made up a kamen. Kamen was lead by a blackarm. Roughly 100 kamen made up a horde, which was lead by a tarkhan. Around 100 to 200 hordes made up a brigade which was lead by baatars.

From several brigades came a khanate' which was lead by one of the eight khans of the Izvoshra. The Supreme Commander of the kolkpravis was the khagan, a title held first by Qymaen jai Sheelal, the infamous Lord Grievous.

    <description>KRAYT DRAGONS

Krayt dragons were large, carnivorous reptiles that hailed from Tatooine, a desert planet in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. They came in two subspecies and, despite their fierceness, were hunted for the precious pearls found in their bodies.

CANYON KRAYT DRAGONS

The canyon krayt was a common species of krayt dragon that lived in the rocky caves and canyons of Tatooine's desert ranges. More often than not, the term "krayt dragon" referred to this lifeform. Patterns of horns and spikes appears to have varied from individual to individual. At least one canyon krayt was noted to have a two-pronged tail.

GREATER KRAYT DRAGONS

The greater krayt was a rarer, larger species of krayt dragon, known for its tremendous size and continual growth over time. Creatures of near legendary status, greater krayt dragons had ten legs, measured at least 100 meters from snout to tail tip and had the ability to move through or on Tatooine's desert sand. Greater krayt dragons attacked with their massive jaws or whip-like spike-tail, using their claws only to move through the sand.

    <description>KX-series security droids, also referred to as enforcer droids, are a model of security droid manufactured by Arakyd Industries that was in service to the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.

Enforcer droids come equipped with a built-in comm package, recharge port, and a computer interface arm that allows them to connect with standard communication frequencies for areas they are assigned to. The droids were designed with exaggerated human proportions but with the mobility of a human athlete. They were able to operate a variety or tools and equipment and can carry gear without becoming exhausted.

While the Imperial Senate had prohibited the creation of battle droids, Arakyd was able to use a loophole in the law by marketing the KX-series as "security droids." They were programmed without the standard restriction against harming organic sentient lifeforms.

The KX-series droids were programmed to speak and interact with people, but were not as pro cient at it as protocol droids were. They could handle a wide range of tasks, including escorting dignitaries, protecting important people and defending Imperial installations. The droids were also programmed to recognize and defer to Imperial Military officers ranked Lieutenant or higher.

    <description>TRANDOSHANS

Trandoshans, also called T'doshok, were large, bipedal reptilian sentient humanoids from the planet Trandosha, and were renowned as great hunters who relished the thrill of the hunt. Trandoshans are known to embark on a hunting related rite of passage.

Notable Trandoshans. A Trandoshan known as Garnac ran a hunting guild based out of a floating fortress that hovered above an island-designated Island Four-on the moon Wasskah. Garnac's scouts traveled to different worlds to collect other sentient beings to dump on Island Four, where the prisoners would be hunted for sport.

Bossk, a famous Trandoshan bounty hunter, worked alongside fellow hunters Aurra Sing and Castas to mentor the orphaned Boba Fett. Bossk owned and operated a modified YV-666 light freighter named the Hound's Tooth. Bossk was renowned and feared for his effectiveness at killing Wookiees. He was ruthless and efficient, but upheld the Bounty Hunter Code and was known to keep his promises to the letter of the law.

    <description>The LR1K sonic cannon, also known as the Geonosian sonic cannon or the Geonosian defense platform, is a high-powered artillery emplacement weapon produced by the Gordarl Weaponsmiths on Geonosis prior to and during the Clone Wars.

The LR1K cannon uses sonic blaster technology that employs internal oscillators to produce a devastating sonic blast. The high impact concussive sonic energy is stabilized by a containment sphere within the cannon. The LR1K requires one or two gunners to operate, although the cannon's advanced, highly-precise targeting computers are capable of doing most of the work. A critical hit with this weapon will instantly kill any average clone.

    <description>Lyleks are a species of large insectoid predators native to the equatorial forests of the planet Ryloth. With their spiked pincers and powerful mandibles with a pair of tentacles near it, the lyleks are the only Rylothian lifeform more dangerous than the predatory gutkurrs. Their ridged, spiked carapaces can deflect blaster bolts. Although the Lyleks live in hordes, the bigger individuals often dismember the smaller individuals of their kind. These hordes are led by a Lylek queen, and their elaborate underground nests can cover up to 15 square kilometers. They communicate by hissing, clicking and chittering. Their carapaces are tough enough to repel even heavy blaster fire, though a precisely aimed shot to the head can put one down.

    <description>Maalraas or Nighthunters are a non-sentient species of predatory quadrupeds. Nighthunters hunted in packs, using long claws and powerful fanged jaws to disable their victims.

Characteristics. Using the Force to cloak themselves, making themselves nearly indistinguishable from the darkest shadows, only extremely well-trained Jedi or Sith cah recognize their silhouettes. Their Hides and bones are heavily resistant to lightsabers as well as intense heat. Maalraas have huge fangs that protrude from their round heads and are possibly the ancestors of nighthunters.

Behavior. Maalraas hunted in packs primarily preyed upon cannoks, although if there were too many of them the cannoks could drive the predator away or even kill it. Maalraas were in turn preyed upon by the zakkeg.

Domestication. Easy to train from infancy or from older ages, Nighthunters are utilised as Loyal guard beasts and are exported from their unrecorded home world by crime syndicates as well as other wealthy individuals willing to trade on the black market.

Spread. While plentiful at the time of the old republic era, by the time of the Clone Wars, they were thought to be extinct, but at least one still survived on Parein II 4. A population exists on the forest moon of Dxun in the Onderon system and possibly Onderon itself.

    <description>TRACKER DROIDS

Tracker Droids are a general term used to describe simple droids that are capable of being permanently linked to via the tech power tracker droid interface. Tracker droids are not all dedicated tracking or probe droids as the name might suggest, but these are the most common types of droids to become linked with in most cultures throughout the galaxy, explaining this commonly used shorthand.

COMBAT TRAINING REMOTE

Combat remotes (or "seeker droids" or "training remotes") are fast-moving and unpredictable. Commonly used by marksmen to improve aim and reaction time, they are equipped with non-lethal blasters to prevent injuries, and are usually shot at with light-only blasts.

    <description>The massiff was a species of dangerous hunters found on desert planets including Tatooine and Geonosis. Massiffs were domesticated for sentry and guard tasks, and were used by the Tusken Raiders of Tatooine.

Biology &amp; Appearance. A massiff is a squat quadruped with a row of spines along their humped backs. Native to desert environments, massiffs are snarling hunters with powerful and dangerous bites. The creature's spines afford it an extra level of defense, and its large eyes allow it to see well at night. An average massiff stood at roughly one meter high, and the species is found on a variety of worlds, typically in desert habitats such as Tatooine, Geonosis, and Florrum.

It is easy to tell the age of a massiff, for they grow a new pair of antlers every standard year.

Domestication. Many massiffs are domesticated and trained for sentry and guard duty. Tusken Raiders, Weequay pirates, and even clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic utilize massiffs as guard beasts. During the Clone Wars, ARF troopers trained massiffs as trackers. On occasion, massiffs were used in arena fighting.

Geonosis. The Geonosians and massiffs have a somewhat symbiotic relationship; in exchange for shelter, the creatures rid the hives of pests. On Geonosis, possession of a massiff is a sign of authority and aristocracy.

    <description>MISTRYL SHADOW GUARDS

The Mistryl Shadow Guards were an elite group of allfemale Human mercenaries, sent from their home planet of Emberlene to earn money in support of the devastated communities of their world.

Emberlene. Using its might and wealth to conquer its neighbors, Emberlene subjugated dozens of worlds in their sector, plundering their wealth, and destroyed anything of value couldn't be taken.

The Destruction. The remaining planets in the sector pooled their resources and hired a mercenary army to fight for them. The mercenaries struck hard and fast, devastating Emberlene's forces and reducing the planet's infrastructure to rubble. Ensuing firestorms and air strikes against populated areas effectively ended the Emberlene threat, reducing its people to abject poverty.

The Lie. In the years after their destruction and partial reconstruction, the Eleven Elders decided to create a lie from this disaster. From a young age, the citizens of Emberlene were taught that many years ago, while the Galactic Empire was still young and early resistance had not been crushed, Emperor Palpatine ordered the destruction of Emberlene as an example to all who thought they could escape the rule of the Empire. This lie was created to instill a sense of loyalty and pride in the people of Emberlene, as well as a false sense of duty amongst the Mistryl.

Organization. The Shadow Guard typically operated in small teams led by a commander known as the Team Prime. On the other hand, Mistryl sometimes traveled as master-and-apprentice pairs, and individual warriors could be contracted out long-term as bodyguards.

True to their mythos that Emberlene had been ravaged by Imperial forces, the Mistryl claimed that they never worked for the New Order, although when that loathing got in the way of a job, they often forgot this animosity, either through convenience or necessity.

Equipment &amp; Methods. While the Guard were deadly at any time, the Shadow Guard were especially adept at close-quarters combat. They were well trained in martial arts, and also had a large amount of weapons training as well. They were trained to use hold-out blasters and vibroblades, and were also educated in the use of more exotic weapons such as hand claws, shock whips, and zenji needles.

The Mistryl were legendary for their stealth and ability to remain unnoticed at all times. They had access to a huge database of profiles of galactic citizens. When needed, a guard could quickly use one of these and assume that person's identity in order to either get close to a target or get away from an area.

    <description>Ordinarily found only in the hilly regions of a littleknown planet at the edge of the Kathol Sector, mole serpents dwell almost entirely underground, burrowing through the soil in search of surface prey. With its keen ability to sense vibrations underground, the mole serpent locates unwary targets and tunnels toward them undetected until it lurches up out of the ground to strike. Mole serpents range from 30-50 feet long, with chitinous plating and short, hornlike projections. By alternately contorting and relaxing its muscles, the mole serpent can create an undulating motion, driving the projections into the surrounding ground and pushing the beast forward. In its native soil, it can travel at speeds of 15 feet per round. One known serpent is known to have made its way to the deserts of Tatooine, and in Tatooine's soft sand, it can move as fast as 30 feet per round. The mole serpent cannot burrow through rock. The movement, of a mole serpent does not create a passable tunnel, but the ground is decidedly softer behind it.

The creatures are the natural predators of the Tirginni beasts. The mole serpent attacks by surfacing, then biting and attempting to swallow smaller creatures.

ATTACK STRATEGY

Because of its unusual attack vector, targets are often surprised. Detecting the approach of a mole serpent requires a Perception check against its Stealth check.

If its swallow attempt succeeds. the mole serpent remains on the surface, searching for another nearby target. If it finds one, it attacks again from the surface on the next round. Otherwise, it burrows back underground to avoid counter attacks.

If the mole serpent fails to swallow its intended prey, it retreats below the ground again and waits for its target to lower its guard. After a failed attack, the mole serpent will not attack again for 1d4+2 rounds. 1f the GM judges that potential targets have sufficiently relaxed (if, for instance, they have begun pursuing unrelated tasks), he may ask for new Perception checks, possibly creating new surprise rounds.

    <description>Kowakian monkey-lizards are a bipedal reptilian species native to a jungle-like Outer Rim planet called Kowak. Although have had no established culture, Kowakian monkey-lizards were quite intelligent, and despite their silly, cruel nature, they are considered sentient by many sentientologists in the galaxy, although there was much debate over that designation. They are often kept as pets due to their mischievous nature.

    <description>Kowakian monkey-lizards are a bipedal reptilian species native to a jungle-like Outer Rim planet called Kowak. Although have had no established culture, Kowakian monkey-lizards were quite intelligent, and despite their silly, cruel nature, they are considered sentient by many sentientologists in the galaxy, although there was much debate over that designation. They are often kept as pets due to their mischievous nature.

    <description>A moof has hoofed feet, a thick hide, and secrets milk. There are individuals who milk moofs, which inspired the term "moof-milker," an insult to a person's intelligence. After recovering the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo used the insult in reference to whoever added a compressor to the ship's hyperdrive; in this case, it was Unkar Plutt, the previous owner of the ship.

    <description>Motts were a species of non-sentient, horn-nosed herbivores found on the planet of Naboo. They fed off swamp vegetation.

Motts were a species of stubby-legged quadrupeds that measured 1.10 meters at the shoulder. They had skin, sharp claws, small horns on their snouts. They had a high reproduction rate, with 15 young per litter. They were herbivores that fed on swamp vegetation.

Despite being herbivores, some motts could display aggressive behavior. They used their horns for defense, mating disputes, and for rooting in the mud for food

Motts evolved on the planet of Naboo, in the Mid Rim region of the galaxy. Their flesh was consumed by sentients.

    <description>Mucous salamanders, or pinkish salamanders, are amphibians native to the bogs of Yavin 4. They possess the distinct ability to diffuse their molecular structures underwater, which allows them to swim faster and pass through hunters' nets. When a mucous salamander enters dry areas, it can change its molecular structure into hardened scales for protection from predators, particularly the angler.

    <description>Mynocks are a species of silicon-based bat-like parasites that chew on the power cables and energy conductors of starships, and can drain a ship's entire power supply. They reproduce by splitting in two and growing new creatures from each half. Mynocks are capable of surviving in the atmospheres of planets and the vacuum of space, though only a few varieties lived on planets. They are also known to inhabit asteroid fields and the gullets of exogorths, where they share in its meals.

    <description>The narglatch is a stealthy, feline, apex predator which can be found in diverse environments, such as the Gungan swamps of Naboo or the frozen tundras of its native Orto Plutonia. Escaped narglatches are a threat on Coruscant. The narglatch are considered to be sacred by the indigenous Talz, who use them as mounts and a source of food.

Biology &amp; Appearance. The narglatch male had additional fleshy spikes, while females were smoother. They both had non-retractable claws and a fan-like tail that acted as a rudder during high-speed chases and turns. The narglatch also had densely padded feet that made for silent footfalls.

A pregnant narglatch always gave birth to twins, one of each gender. Since young narglatch could hunt immediately upon birth, mothers abandoned them.

Behavior. Cubs hunted together until maturity, making themselves less vulnerable to such Naboo creatures, as saw-toothed granks, veermoks, and even more mature male narglatch. As they approached maturity, the cubs separated.

A solitary hunter, narglatch silently stalked and quickly killed its prey, usually kaadu or jimvu. Narglatch generally avoided deep water, although they were capable swimmers should the need arise. One of the few creatures they actively avoided were zalaacas.

    <description>GALACTIC NAVY

As the branch of the galactic military that deals with space operations, the galactic navy has been composed of many sub-units and organizations, and has utilized a vast array of starships to achieve its objectives throughout the years.

Republic Navy. The Republic Navy, also referred to as the Republic fleet, Republic starfleet or the Galactic Republic fleet, was the military naval force of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. The Navy served to transport the clone army across the galaxy while also engaging in ship-to-ship combat with the

Confederacy navy. Following the end of the war and the formation of the Galactic Empire, the Republic Navy transitioned into the Imperial Navy.

Imperial Navy. The Imperial Navy, also known as the Imperial Starfleet or the Imperial fleet, was the naval branch of the Galactic Empire's military. It was created in the wake of the Clone Wars, when Chancellor Sheev Palpatine transformed the Galactic Republic he led into an authoritarian Empire. Consisting mainly of Star Destroyers and TIE fighters, the Imperial Navy was tasked with maintaining order in the galaxy.

First Order Navy. The First Order Navy, also referred to as the First Order fleet, was the naval branch of the First Order military. It superseded the Imperial Navy of the former Galactic Empire, it would be paramount to the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions by the Imperial successor state, the First Order.

    <description>Nerfs were a species of furry, non-sentient animals raised for their milk, meat, and hide. They could be found on a variety of planets across the galaxy, from Alderaan to Lothal. Despite their usefulness, nerfs were often regarded as disgusting because of their strong body odor.

    <description>Nexu are predatory felines native to the planet Cholganna. They are also found on Zhanox.

Biology &amp; Appearance. There are other breeds of nexu on Cholganna's other continents, but only the forest nexu has an additional set of eyes able to view in infrared wavelength, which aid in their hunting of bark rats and tree-climbing octopi. Nexu are 4.5 meters long and generally 1 meter tall.

The nexu has claws which can slice a Human in half. They have quills along their back, and a long tail that allows the nexu to swing from tree branch to tree branch. The tail also splits into two equal sections for a better grip on the tree branch they are swinging from. They have extremely sharp instincts and reflexes, although they are known to tire easily, and often use swift movements to finish an enemy quickly, biting down and thrashing their head about to break their victim's neck. Cubs are born pure white.

Useage. Nexu are often exported and trained as security beasts or used in arena combat.

    <description>The NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer of the Confederacy of Independent Systems is a droid tank manufactured by the Techno Union and mainly utilized by Corporate Alliance. The impressive armament of the tank includes ion cannons and heavy repeating blasters, although this weapons package could be swapped out with alternative packages that included shock ri􀃖es or concussion missile launchers. The tank moves by way of its huge central tread, and it is augmented on either of its sides by forward-mounted outrigger wheels on a pontoon tread, which gives additional stability. Infantry soldiers are also able to ride on top of these tanks. The NR-N99 Persuader-class tank droid is able to move up to 60 km/hr, but this droid tank lacks the agility of walking droid tanks. It is also able to plow through battle􀃕elds and ram barricades. The droid is able to function through a variety of terrain, and the droid is also able to move on top of water.

The NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer is well-armored, possesses heat exchange panels and communications antennae, and the unit has armor-shielded photoreceptors. It was designed to be be able to function with its computer brain, but the vehicle could also be controlled by a pilot droid.

    <description>Nunas, also known as swamp turkeys are diminutive bipeds that live in the swamps of Naboo. These birds cannot fly and are known for their stupidity, but are also adaptable and easy to care for. Nunas have spread across the galaxy, prized for their meat and eggs. They are omnivores, feeding mostly on plants and, on rare occasions, fish. An average nuna can feed a family of four. Nunas are also used as a ball in nunaball. When nunas become angry or intimidated, they can inflate their body to a larger size.

    <description>GALACTIC NAVY

As the branch of the galactic military that deals with space operations, the galactic navy has been composed of many sub-units and organizations, and has utilized a vast array of starships to achieve its objectives throughout the years.

Republic Navy. The Republic Navy, also referred to as the Republic fleet, Republic starfleet or the Galactic Republic fleet, was the military naval force of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. The Navy served to transport the clone army across the galaxy while also engaging in ship-to-ship combat with the

Confederacy navy. Following the end of the war and the formation of the Galactic Empire, the Republic Navy transitioned into the Imperial Navy.

Imperial Navy. The Imperial Navy, also known as the Imperial Starfleet or the Imperial fleet, was the naval branch of the Galactic Empire's military. It was created in the wake of the Clone Wars, when Chancellor Sheev Palpatine transformed the Galactic Republic he led into an authoritarian Empire. Consisting mainly of Star Destroyers and TIE fighters, the Imperial Navy was tasked with maintaining order in the galaxy.

First Order Navy. The First Order Navy, also referred to as the First Order fleet, was the naval branch of the First Order military. It superseded the Imperial Navy of the former Galactic Empire, it would be paramount to the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions by the Imperial successor state, the First Order.

Once attached to a target, the orbalisk begins to reproduce through fragmentation. Whenever the host completes a long rest, they must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. For each saving throw the host fails, the size of their Hit Dice is reduced: from d12 to d10, from d10 to d8, from d8 to d6, from d6 to d4, or from d4 to d2. If the host fails a saving throw while their Hit Die is a d2, they die as the orbalisks consume them.</text>

    <description>Orbalisks are parasitic creatures native to Dxun. They lay inactive in caves or other dark places, until they find a suitable host creature on whose skin they can attach themselves to in order to feed. Orbalisks, once attached to a host, rapidly multiply, eventually enveloping and suffocating their victim. However, the holocron of Freedon Nadd contains the knowledge to make armament to prevent the orbalisks from covering the face, hands, and feet of the host, allowing them to keep this armor hidden.
		Perhaps by nature or as a result of residing on Dxun (which was itself a great focus of dark side power), orbalisks are able to feed on the Force-sensitivity of dark side wielders. It is said that the orbalisk armor's durability was such that lightsabers have a hard time penetrating it, making a wearer effectively immune to lightsaber attacks. The only weaknesses to this armor are the exposed joints at the neck and wrists, but these gaps are so small a lightsaber can only barely slice through. However, orbalisk armor is unable to protect the wearer from electricity. Orbalisks cause the wearer to feel pain, fueling the wearers dark side power; if they are removed or killed, they release a highly potent toxin into the host's body.

For each saving throw the host fails, the size of their Hit Dice is reduced: from d12 to d10, from d10 to d8, from d8 to d6, from d6 to d4, or from d4 to d2.

    <description>Orbalisks are parasitic creatures native to Dxun. They lay inactive in caves or other dark places, until they find a suitable host creature on whose skin they can attach themselves to in order to feed. Orbalisks, once attached to a host, rapidly multiply, eventually enveloping and suffocating their victim. However, the holocron of Freedon Nadd contains the knowledge to make armament to prevent the orbalisks from covering the face, hands, and feet of the host, allowing them to keep this armor hidden.

      Perhaps by nature or as a result of residing on Dxun (which was itself a great focus of dark side power), orbalisks are able to feed on the Force-sensitivity of dark side wielders. It is said that the orbalisk armor's durability was such that lightsabers have a hard time penetrating it, making a wearer effectively immune to lightsaber attacks. The only weaknesses to this armor are the exposed joints at the neck and wrists, but these gaps are so small a lightsaber can only barely slice through. However, orbalisk armor is unable to protect the wearer from electricity. Orbalisks cause the wearer to feel pain, fueling the wearers dark side power; if they are removed or killed, they release a highly potent toxin into the host's body.

    <description>Pelko bugs are small creatures that are covered in millions of microscopic barbs that deliver a paralytic, blistering toxin which can penetrate armor. They live only beneath sands of the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban, and are attracted to Force-sensitives. They stalk and swarm their prey in the darkness. The bug's attunement to the Force allows them to determine if a creature is suitable prey. The barbs are used in training sabers at the Sith Academy because of the toxin's effects, which mimick the effects of losing a limb to a lightsaber.

    <description>Pistoeka sabotage droids, better known simply as buzz droids, were a type of insect-like automatons that were deployed in swarms during battlefleet actions by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. They could wreak havoc upon squadrons of starfighters that happened to fly through a formation of such deployed droids. Approximately one-quarter of a meter in diameter and well-armed for their role, they were typically delivered by discord missiles from droid trifighters and Vulture droid starfighters.

    <description>Porgs are a species of non-sentient birds. They are stocky in nature, with two short wings, flat, beak-less faces, and two webbed feet. Porgs are sexually dimorphic; males are slightly larger than females, and males also have orange plumage around the eyes. Porgs of both sexes are covered in dense feathers, with white coloration on the body and face, and gray to brown on the wings and back. They are much lighter than they looked, thanks to a thick outer layer of waterproof feathers with a fluffy underlayer for warmth. They can fly short distances but not far enough to leave their native island. They can also run quite swiftly on the ground and are good at maneuvering into small spaces. The birds have stereoscopic vision, colored with brown irises and black pupils. Porgs favor cold environments.

    <description>PROBE DROIDS

Probe droids (AKA probots or recon droids) are droids specifically designed to perform reconnaissance, reporting anything of significance as defined by specific preprogrammed protocols. Some models are equipped with a selfdestruct mechanism in order to prevent those whom it had been sent to observe from studying them and determining their source, as well as a small blaster-type weapon for defense.

SITH PROBE DROID

Sith probe droids were designed as passive spy units, and were plated with energy-absorbing stealth armor that baffled most sensor scans. However, weaponry could be mounted on the Sith Probe Droids in many configurations: the most common being a miniaturized grenade launcher. Armaments adopted by the Sith included blaster cannons, stun blasters, and dart launchers loaded with poison needles.

    <description>The Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix is a droid personality matrix that was created centuries before the rise of the Galactic Empire. The matrix is considered incredibly dangerous when placed into its designed droid body: a protocol droid. The matrix, when inserted into a protocol droid, turns it into an assassin droid that specializes in torture.

It was quarantined on Quarantine World III in Kallidahin Space for centuries before it was stolen by the rogue archaeologist Doctor Aphra during the Galactic Civil War.

    <description>The 3PO-series protocol droid is a Human-cyborg relations protocol droid produced by Cybot Galactica. They are equipped with a TranLang III communication module, and as a result are fluent in over 6 million forms of communication. The model series has very similar aesthetic design in its casing to other Cybot Galactica droid model series such as the TC-series, 3PXseries, and 5YQ-series protocol droids.

    <description>The LOM-series protocol droid was manufactured by Industrial Automaton and were designed with insectile features to emulate the species they were created to serve: the sentient Gand. The LOM-series had a flaw that allowed the personality software of a droid to be corrupted. Many LOM-series droids became enforcers in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. The most notable, 4-LOM, became a bounty hunter, sometimes seen with the Gand, Zuckuss.

Aside from the insectile face, the LOM protocol droid was very similar to the 3PO-series—indeed, Industrial Automaton made crafty deals with companies such as SyntheTech, to use many components initially used by Cybot Galactica. Thus, the LOM-series possessed an AA-1 VerboBrain and a TranLang III communications module programmed with millions of languages; it even had a similar body frame and plating design. Such blatant use of its trademark hardware caused Cybot Galactica to file a number of lawsuits against its rival company. Though their LOM units sold well in limited release, Industrial Automaton's future plans to monopolize the protocol droid market were dashed.

    <description>Rakghouls are a living plague—the manifestation of a highly communicable disease capable of swiftly transforming its victims into twisted, degenerate monsters with predatory instincts. The rakghoul virus can infect hundreds of known species and is most often delivered through a rakghoul's bite; a person attacked by a rakghoul and "lucky" enough to survive typically becomes a rakghoul him- or herself. Some victims resist the virus for days, succumbing to rakghoul instincts while retaining their original bodies.

    <description>Rathtars were large, carnivorous cephalopods that were native to the planet Twon Ketee. Regarded as one of the most dangerous beasts in the galaxy, rathtars were known for hunting in packs, and their subspecies, the dwarf rathtar were involved in an incident known as the Trillia Massacre.

Biology. Although the study of rathtars was rare due to the danger posed by the beasts, it was believed that they shared common ancestry with other tentacled species such as the sarlaccs, the blixii, and the vixus of Umbara. Rathtars reproduced by fission, leading to rapidly increasing numbers if the species' population was not controlled.

Hunting. Rathtars appeared physiologically primitive, endowed with only rudimentary senses and possessing small brains. Despite the appearance of a mindless eating machine, rathtars proved effective at working together, and displayed affinity for pack hunting. Individual rathtars appeared to become smarter when in proximity to others of its species, and rathtar packs utilized howls, at a frequency beyond humanoid hearing, to communicate among one another. They also vocalized deafening roars when attacking and devouring prey, and let out horrifying shrieks of fury when in pain. If in danger from a rathtar, one's best hope was to hide, as the creatures were largely blind.

Feeding. Lacking a true skeleton, a rathtar had an enormous, round, slug-like body covered in light-reactive sensing orbs. They possessed multiple long, tentacle-like appendages; their principle feeding tentacles whipped out to capture and devour prey, which typically consisted of anything they perceived as non-rathtar. The creatures were ravenous and persistent eaters, capable of consuming virtually anything that they could fit into their robust, radial mouths, which were funnel-shaped and lined with rows of razor sharp teeth. Their throat distended outward into a hollow tongue, useful for swallowing struggling prey. The bilious creatures typically tore their meals apart piece by piece.

Movement. Capable of locomotion, rathtars curled their ambulatory tentacles inward to form a ball and roll themselves forward in a whirl of whipping tentacles. They moved deceptively fast for their size, and had adhesive pads on their pointed tentacle tips—known as a club—which helped them attach to surfaces.

Tentacles and Tougness. Their tentacles had enormous strength, and were of a muscular hydrostat form. Their fleshy bodies were covered in a hard, rubbery exterior, giving the rathtars a heavy resistance to blaster bolts, smallarms fire, and even biting attacks.

    <description>A riot represents most of the population of a small town or a third of a city, gathering large masses. The sheer numbers make riots almost impossible to contain, requiring consequential resources or important fortifications to impede their progress. An organization that could gather such numbers would certainly have a regional, and perhaps planet-wide, influence.

    <description>Ronto are large, quadruped mammals that are commonly used as beasts of burden by the Jawas of Tatooine. They are known for their loyalty and strength, being able to carry hundreds of kilograms of weight. Like the native dewbacks of Tatooine, ronto are easy to train and become quite fond of their masters, whose faces they associate with food. They are large enough to frighten off Tusken Raiders, though they are easily spooked by machines, such as speeder bikes.

A creature takes 6d8 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlpool until the power ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlpool, the creature is pulled 5 feet deeper inside it, unless the creature is at the bottom. A restrained creature moves with the whirlpool and is submerged when the effect ends, unless the creature has some means to stay afloat. A restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 21 Strength or Dexterity check. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlpool and is hurled 3d6x10 feet away from it in a random direction. The whirlpool ends at the beginning of the monster's turn unless the monster used the Whirlpool legendary action to maintain the whirlpool. The monster creates a whirlpool in the water at a point within 30 feet that it can see. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-deep cylinder centered on that point. On subsequent turns, the monster can use the Whirlpool legendary action to maintain and move the whirlpool up to 30 feet in any direction along the surface of the water. The whirlpool sucks up any medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.</text>

    <description>Sando aqua monsters are enormous, muscular predators that could be found in the oceans and lakes of Naboo.

Biology and Appearance. Despite measuring between 160 and 200 meters in length, the sando aqua monsters manage to hide in their native oceanic depths. Sandos have heavily muscled bodies that look almost feline, with strong limbs ending in finned claws that propell them through the depths.

Their huge mouths allow them to swallow most other creatures of the Abyss in a single gulp. Using their razor-sharp teeth, they are also the only predators capable of biting through the hard shells of the opee sea killers.

Being mammalian, females nursed their young for about a year. Females bore only one pup per birth.

Their life-spans typically reach one hundred standard years.

Behavior. The sando aqua monsters were carnivores. In order to maintain their gigantic bodies, those voracious creatures needed to feed constantly, and they often devoured entire schools of fish. There have even been reports of sando monsters surfacing in swamp lakes and attacking falumpaset and fambaa herds, and unsubstantiated reports of them sunning themselves on sandbars.

      <text>The sarlacc makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the sarlacc, and it takes 35 (10d6) psychic damage at the start of each of the sarlacc's turns. A creature reduced to zero hit points this way stops taking the psychic damage and becomes stable. If the sarlacc takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the sarlacc must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the sarlacc. If the sarlacc dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

      <text>The sarlacc releases pheromones in a 300 foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature is charmed by the sarlacc for 1 minute. While charmed this way, the target tries to get as close to the sarlacc as possible, using its actions to Dash until it is within 5 feet of the sarlacc. A charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature has advantage on saving throws against the sarlacc's Pheromones for 24 hours.</text>

    <description>The sarlacc is a large, immobile, omnivorous invertebrate with long tentacles that rim its mouth. There is some debate among xenobiologists as to whether the creature is a plant or animal, though most find the creature far too dangerous to merit an extended study of the question.

Biology. They reproduce by spores, known as "sarlacci," that travel through space until they find another suitable planet to inhabit. After implanting itself into the ground, the sarlacci grow downward like a plant, forming a pit. The mouth and tentacles are the most visible parts of the sarlacc. The rest of the sarlacc's massive anatomical features are buried up to one hundred meters deep in the ground. This guarantees protection of the sarlacc's vital organs and makes it invulnerable to most forms of serious damage. The sarlacc's mouth is the only part of the body visible, usually. Most of its body is covered in rigid plates. It has eight appendages beneath the ground used for stability or for reburial if the sarlacc becomes partially exposed. The body of the sarlacc ends in three roots used for moisture absorption.These appendiges and roots are also used to sense the vibrations from nearby creatures. The sarlacc lacks eyes and ears, instead relying on the sensors in its roots to "see" its prey.

Feeding. The teeth of the sarlacc surround its beaklike tongue and plant-like tentacles in tiers. Its teeth are also slightly slanted inward ensuring its prey remains trapped. Despite their size, the sarlacc does not need to eat much or often. While its lightning-fast tentacles are used to snatch up its prey, they are not its primary means of capturing a meal. The sarlacc discharges odors and scents that lure herbivores and scavengers close enough for it to use its tentacles.

Digestion. After being swallowed by the tongue, the victim makes its way into the sarlacc's stomach to be digested, being kept alive and slowly digested for a millennium. A strong network of vessels inside the stomach punctures the victim's skin and muscles before injecting neurotoxins into them, preventing the victims from escaping and ensuring that they remain immersed in the acidic fluids in the stomach, and attached to the walls of the stomach. The vessels also provide victims with nutrients to keep them alive while they are digested in agony.

A number of smaller, secondary stomachs are used to store victims for later consumption at times when the sarlacc needs larger amounts of nutrients, such as when it needs to grow, breed, or strengthen its tentacles and beak for catching stronger, larger prey. The secondary stomachs also function as a space to store victims when the main stomach runs out of room. The acidic fluids in the stomachs are composed of weak chemicals that take much longer to digest prey than acids in the stomach of other creatures. The pain endured by its victims in this process was reputed to be unimaginable. It is theorized that sarlaccs may be telepathic and may gain consciousness from the creatures they eat by assimilating their thoughts and memories during digestion.

Notable Examples. One of the known specimens of the species resides in the Great Pit of Carkoon, beneath the sands of the Dune Sea on the remote planet of Tatooine. Most sarlacci preferred damp environments, but they could live nearly anywhere including the desert sands of Tatooine.

The largest known sarlacc in galactic history resides on the planet Felucia within the Ancient Abyss. It possessed massive tendrils and teeth that spread out over an area of the Abyss that was kilometers across.

    <description>The scrange was a large tusk-tailed, reptilian apex predator of Dagobah, attacking its prey with a great ferocity. Scranges were beaked and had many bioluminescent patches on their body, arranged in a ridge along its spine. When prey got close, attracted by the lights, the scrange would lift out of the mud on its six crustacean-like hind legs to make a quick attack or it would use its four tail tusks to impale its prey.

    <description>The SD-K4 assassin droid, also known as the assassin probe, is a model of assassin droid manufactured by the Techno Union. Used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, it was also referred to as the Separatist assassin probe and Separatist assassin droid.

The SD-K4 assassin droid is designed to assassinate targets with high efficiency. Spider-like droids programmed for quiet killing, assassin probes move quietly on eight razored legs. They are equipped with multiple red photoreceptors for scanning their surroundings. If cornered or destroyed, an SD-K4 can release dozens of smaller probe killers from pores on its head to finish any job the assassin probe started.

    <description>Shaaks are a species of non-sentient herbivores that graze on the grasslands of Naboo. Gentle and nonthreatening, shaaks are slow movers. They have four legs, brown leathery skin, and their bodies are plump with blubber. Shaaks are unable to swim, due to their size, and so avoid the swamps of Naboo. If infected with the waterborne Blue Shadow Virus, shaaks will die instantly, while members of most other species have 48 hours to live before the virus becomes fatal.

    <description>Shyracks are cave-dwelling terrors that are fiercely territorial and attack any intruder with aggression and fervor. While typically cave bound, every sixty-three years the shyracks of Korriban spill from their cave habitats for an entire summer. These periods saw them fill the sky where they blotted out the sun and moon where they rained their bluish droppings onto everything below. Prior to the return of the Sith Empire, biologists from across the galaxy arrived on the planet in order to witness every sixty-third summer where they observed the purpling of the red Korriban terrain. While ungainly and slow-moving with no eyes, shyracks are potentially dangerous pests, especially when they converge as a swarm on an intruder. They are native to the Shyrack cave of Korriban and are natural rivals to the feared Tuk'ata.

    <description>Vicious, medium-sized, hematophagous flying reptomammals, skettos dwelled in the caverns of Tatooine. Only emerging when light conditions were at their lowest, these four-winged beasts possessed excellent twilight vision to assist in the consumption of airborne insects. Skettos fell into the reptomammal class, being warm-blooded and giving live birth to a single offspring at a time.

The most horrifying part of a sketto's life was its tendency to swarm with others of its kind to suck the blood of large, sleeping mammals. Their large, frightening teeth helped to puncture the toughest of hides, and legend had it that a sketto swarm could suck a sleeping dewback dry overnight. Despite being a reptomammal, they bled green blood.

    <description>A smuggler, also known by the euphemism free trader, is someone who engaged in the clandestine shipment of goods or people to prevent taxation or some other impediment. The goods shipped are often highly illegal or banned in some sectors. Weapon smugglers are referred to as gun runners.

By far the most commonly smuggled substances are varieties of spice. Although most kinds of spice are psychoactive drugs, and most forms were illegal under the Empire, the government's main concern is not to stem the flow of spice, but to collect taxes from its shipment and distribution through legitimate channels. Weapons were another commonly smuggled commodity within the Empire, whose bureaucracy strictly controlled weapons availability in order to prevent criminals and insurgents, in particular the Rebel Alliance, from becoming significant threats. Other cargo for smugglers include chak-root, stolen merchandise, and even clear water. In extreme situations, smugglers delivered standard resources or food.

    <description>The Spotlight sloth, or Dagobah swamp sloth, is a large furry mammal covered in a waterproof greenish-brown fur. They are so named because of the blue bioluminescent patches beneath the leathery skin on their hairless chests. These "spotlight" patches, when revealed, are used to induce plants and fungi to unfold and/or burst. The sloth then uses its small paws to quickly stuff food into its toothless mouth.

The sloths are preyed upon by Dagobah's knobby white spiders. One stab of the spider's venomous stinger can knock out an unlucky sloth.

    <description>Starweirds are incorporeal, humanoid, Force-using creatures found only in the vacuum of space.

Biology and Appearance. They are tall and extremely gaunt, wearing ephemeral rags that hang from their arms. Starweirds have long, wild white hair that floats around their heads, ignoring gravity. The creatures have pale skin and their faces are desiccated. Many witnesses state that the creature's face somewhat resembles their own. Starweirds each have a large, toothy mouth and eyes that glow. Their arms are bony and end in hands with three large, sharp, black talons. The species' incorporeal nature makes it possible for the creatures to resist conventional attacks and pass through solid objects, although force fields still stop the creatures. They are also fully affected by the use of the Force.

Starweirds hover or fly silently instead of walking. While fairly intelligent, the creatures do not communicate and had no known language. They have no known ecological role, and after dying, a starweird leaves no traces of itself.

Behavior. Starweirds may appear to spacers repairing their damaged starship in deep space, or manifest aboard a ship traveling in hyperspace. Upon being spotted, starweirds become enraged and released a loud, piercing telepathic shriek. The creatures are noted for having a particular hatred for Force-sensitives, who they will mindlessly concentrate on killing even if there are other creatures present. Some Jedi hypothesize that they are physical manifestations of the dark side of the Force. However, there is little evidence to supported the theory.

    <description>Steelpeckers are a non-sentient species of carrion bird native to the planet Jakku. They have beaks and talons that are tipped with iron; they feed mainly on metal, to which they are drawn by its magnetic signature. To digest the metal they consume, Steelpeckers store vanadium, osmiridium, and corundum in their gizzards. Named for their diet, these birds are useful commodities to scavengers, who collect their carcasses and guano.

    <description>The steep are a species of non-sentient amphibians native to the planet Metellos. They dwell in the sewage-filled seas of the planet, bobbing on the surface of the waters. At night, the carnivorous steeps wander the alleyways of Metellos' settlements, searching for children to eat.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Steeps stand on four spindly legs, each of which ends with a webbed foot, and are capable of walking on land. The carnivorous amphibians are protected by a tough, rubbery hide of ten-centimeter-thick, brownish-white skin. Although their heads are large, their brains are small. A steep's mouth stretches from one side of the head to the other, with two eyes located on purple stalks protruding from the tops of their heads. Similarly, purple-colored growths extend down the backs of the species.

Behavior. Designated as non-sentient, steeps are known for their lack of intelligence and, when fighting an adversary, will continue attacking relentlessly until they themselves have been killed. Steeps are named after their habit of "steeping" themselves in the sewage-filled waters of their homeworld Metellos' seas. The amphibians are frequently seen floating on the surface of the water. Steeps are known to roam down Metellean alleyways at night seeking children for prey.

    <description>Tactical droids are a type of battle droid designed to plan battle strategies. Baktoid Combat Automata manufactured several models of tactical droid, including the T-series tactical droid and a more advanced super tactical droid. Later, L-1 tactical droids would be used during the Galactic Civil War.

SUPER TACTICAL DROID

Super tactical droids are advanced tactical droids that had command capabilities during the Clone Wars, acting as generals of the Separatist Droid Army.

They would often resort to threats and torture as interrogation routes. These droids were created to analyze a battle, calculate a possible battle-winning solution, and a time frame to carry out their plan. Being programmed with Separatist beliefs, they ruled through fear and through the lack of courage and hope in their victims and specifically "freedom from the tyranny of the republic." Although Super Tactical Droids were not directly involved in combat, they were able to effectively use self-defense and an E-5 blaster rifle. Being programmed for success, they are willing to kill for the advancement of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

Building off their predecessors, the T-series tactical droid, they had a much more robotic inflection to their voices, as well a larger, more imposing and more damage-resistant body. These droids were also able to better process and adapt to sudden changes and unexpected complications and have more variables in their calculations. Although better than those before them, flaws in their programming were still prevalent. These included the difficulty to see approaches and plans that differ from their own, and the overconfidence in the Confederacy of Independent Systems and its army.

    <description>An omnivorous species, swamp slugs have thousands of teeth and twenty-four pairs of legs. Their orange or golden eyes, the size of boulders, allow them to see clearly beneath the murky, cloudy waters, while the two rubbery antennae on the top of their heads, which grew to two meters, utilize sonar to pinpoint exact locations of objects, searching by motion. Swamp slugs are omnivores, eating anything organic that they can fit in their mouths of jagged teeth. The teeth, or radula, lining the slug's esophagus pulverize into organic slime any plant or animal matter that it ingests. An hermaphroditic species, the swamp slugs reproduce sexually. Each partner lays hundreds of eggs, most of which are eaten by other animals. They exude a thick, foul-smelling mucus which damages the breathing organs of other species. They are not desirable to eat by other predators and are given a wide berth in the swamps.

    <description>A swoop, or swoop bike, was a type of repulsorlift vehicle designed for speed. In essence, it was a more dangerous version of a speeder bike that both its enthusiasts and its detractors described as an "engine with a seat." Although more powerful than speeder bikes, swoops were crude and lacked finesse. They were hard to control, requiring instinct, strength, and timing. Swoops were capable of traveling at over six hundred kilometers per hour. While some could travel several hundred kilometers above a planet's surface, they generally kept a low altitude.

Swoop races were popular on many planets across the galaxy and were loved for their excitement and outlaw image. Swoops were to speeder bikes what airspeeders were to landspeeders. Swoops were often used by gangs and criminals, and such organizations bore the mantle of swoop gang. After the Galactic Empire outlawed podracing, swoop racing became the favored alternative.

    <description>T-series tactical droids are a model of tactical droid manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata for use during the Clone Wars. They were utilized by the Confederacy of Independent Systems to coordinate their military, acting as advisors and often generals for their superior officers. The droids were deployed across the galaxy in many key battles of the war such as those at Christophsis, Ryloth and the Second Battle of Geonosis.

Ruthlessly intelligent, the T-series mostly steer clear of the war's front lines and instead command their troops from various Separatist headquarters. They exhibit independence larger than that of their B1 battle droid comrades, and although they were loyal to the Separatist cause, they were not afraid to abandon their superiors to guarantee their own survival.

Later on in the Clone Wars, the more advanced super tactical droid was introduced but its predecessor still saw continued use up until at least 19 BBY. Despite the galaxy-wide deactivation of the droid army at the end of the war, the remnants of the T-series could still be found well into the Imperial Era.

    <description>The T3-series utility droid was a Utility droid produced by Duwani Mechanical Products at some point prior to the Great Droid Revolution. They remained popular for years to come and were still the most recent of a long line of physically identical models as of 3956 BBY. Earlier models in the same series included the 3C, IT, and T1 models. Designed to function as a maintenance droid for a variety of mechanical and electronic systems, the T3 was internally more advanced than its predecessors.

The T3 droid was originally designed for repair and general maintenance duties and worked at its optimum level aboard starships. As with other utility droids of the era, the T3 unit had four wheeled legs, of which the front two were attached to the droid's blocky chassis by rotating joints, allowing the droid to slide backwards and forwards to adjust the unit's height. The T3's roughly toroidal head featured a large main photoreceptor and two secondary ones, a broadcast antenna and vocabulator that allowed the droid to communicate in Droidspeak. Without periodic memory wipes, these models developed personality and behavioral traits. It was even known for some units to form gangs, making a living as thieves. Others sold their computer-slicing skills to criminals.

The sophisticated mechanical and computer training software loaded into the T3 utility droid allowed it to function in the capacity of an engineer or even a copilot aboard a starship, making it a favored purchase for traders and smugglers alike. One common modification was the addition of a starfighter interface package, allowing the droid to plug directly into a specialized slot on a starfighter, granting starfighter pilots the same benefit that transport pilots have come to expect from the T3.

Some custom T3 droids also had weapon mounts able to fit a number of readily available blaster pistols mounted in the droid.

    <description>Terentatek are creatures which feed off the blood of Force-sensitives, and inhabit caves and tombs strong with the dark side of the Force.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Terentateks resemble small rancors (approximately one-fourth the size of a fullygrown bull Rancor) with a number of spines growing from their backs and a pair of flaps, or tusk-like projections attached to their mouths. They also have four massive claws on each hand. Their tusks and claws are highly venomous. It is theorized that they were once rancors, subjected to mutations by the Sith, and that when the dark side is weak in the galaxy, they hibernate and remain dormant for many years, only to return when the dark side is strong again. A terentatek's hide is highly resistant - in some cases even immune - to the effects of the Force. They became the most dangerous of the creatures bred by the Sith, and were often dubbed Jedi Killers.

    <description>Trandoshans, also called T'doshok, were large, bipedal reptilian sentient humanoids from the planet Trandosha, and were renowned as great hunters who relished the thrill of the hunt. Trandoshans are known to embark on a hunting related rite of passage.

Notable Trandoshans. A Trandoshan known as Garnac ran a hunting guild based out of a floating fortress that hovered above an island-designated Island Four-on the moon Wasskah. Garnac's scouts traveled to different worlds to collect other sentient beings to dump on Island Four, where the prisoners would be hunted for sport.

Bossk, a famous Trandoshan bounty hunter, worked alongside fellow hunters Aurra Sing and Castas to mentor the orphaned Boba Fett. Bossk owned and operated a modified YV-666 light freighter named the Hound's Tooth. Bossk was renowned and feared for his effectiveness at killing Wookiees. He was ruthless and efficient, but upheld the Bounty Hunter Code and was known to keep his promises to the letter of the law.

    <description>Well-suited for destroying lightly defended buildings, such as Prefab shelters and power cores, mounted troopers' primary role was in attacking hostile combat vehicles such as combat speeders and attack tanks. They accomplished this task by utilizing a flamethrower as their primary weapon. Mounted troopers were usually vulnerable to unmounted troopers and ground vehicles.

Common mounts include Orray form Geonosis, Dewbacks from Tatooine, Kaadu and Tusk-cats from Naboo, Tauntauns from Hoth, Blurrgs from Endor, and Varactyls from Utapau.

    <description>The Force-sensitive tuk'ata, or Sith hounds, have been used for thousands of years to guard the tombs of the Dark Lords of the Sith on Korriban.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Sith hounds are oversized beasts that are bred to be both fearless and relentless. Their distinctive characteristics included sharp horns, long claws and savage teeth. Tuk'ata are unusually intelligent and are even able to communicate with one another through means unknown. It is claimed that originally the species was non-violent and grazing before being corrupted by Sith alchemy experiments that awakened latent parts of their brain which transformed them into unnatural abominations. On occasion, random mutations produce some tuk'ata that are able to live for centuries and grow to immense proportions.

Considering that many Sith hounds were sealed inside the tombs themselves, some believe that they are immortal or draw nourishment from the Force itself, the latter part of which is likely true. It is also possible that they survive by feeding on small vermin or other creatures that infest the tombs as decay and time create new openings in the stone walls.

    <description>Tusken Raiders, or "Sand People," are a species native to Tatooine. Extremely xenophobic &amp;amp; territorial of their native resources, Tuskens often attack the outskirts of smaller settlements. They believe all water is sacred and promised to them, resulting in them raiding moisture farms set up by colonists.

Clan groups consist of 20-30 individuals, and are led by clan leaders, tribal chiefs, and warlords. At the age of 15, a Tusken becomes an adult, and had to slay a krayt dragon and cut out the precious pearl found in its stomach. Tuskens inhabit encampments scattered across an area of the rocky Jundland Wastes known as The Needles, which are guarded by vicious massiffs.

They wield gaderffii sticks in combat, and use Tusken Cyclers to fire on vehicles they spot. Every Tusken warrior creates their own unique gaderffii stick. Males wear rough wrappings and garments that provide protection and allowed ease of movement. Females can be distinguished by their elaborate jeweled masks with eyeslits and torso-covering sand-shrouds. Tusken children wear unisex cowls and simple cloaks. All Sand People wear mouth grilles and eye coverings to retain moisture and keep sand out. They are forbidden to remove their clothing in front of others, except at childbirth, on their wedding night, and at coming-ofage ceremonies.

The Sand People and banthas share a close, almost mystical bond. During warrior initiation rites, a young Tusken is given a bantha matching their own gender and learns to care for it, with the pair becoming extremely close as the youth earns a place in its clan. When Sand People marry, their banthas also mate, and, should its rider die, their bantha usually perishes shortly after. If a bantha dies before its rider, its remains are placed in a large graveyard, which is treated with great respect by Tuskens and other banthas.

    <description>The Vesuvague Tree, also known as the Vesuvague Hanging Tree, is a carnivorous, semi-sentient, redbarked tree from the planet of Ithor. It is one of a number of intelligent plants from the world, a category of which included the Bafforr tree.

The vesuvague tree, though rooted in the earth, is able to detect and move itself towards motion by sensing air vibrations in its leaves and ground vibrations in its roots. In order to catch its prey, it uses its quickly growing vines and roots, capable of extending multiple meters in mere seconds, to seize, strangle, and crush its food. Once a creature is dead, the tree buries its vines and roots inside of its prey, and slowly feeds off of its bodily fluids.

The tree can be trained to respond to simple commands, much like a pet, and can understand words by using its leaves to sense the vibrations and patterns of spoken languages.

    <description>The vornskr, native to the planet Myrkr, are a wild, vicious canine species that have the unusual ability to sense the Force. This ability evolved to help them hunt ysalamiri, but a side effect caused them to think that Force-sensitives were their favorite prey, including Jedi in their appetite. Vornskrs were also used as guards in the Dark Force Temple on Dromund Kaas. The Yuuzhan Vong used the species as a biological template for the voxyn.

Behavior. Vornskrs are primarily nocturnal hunters, and use their whip-like, mildly venomous tails to stun prey before finishing them off with their teeth. They are normally sedate during the day, but hunger or other factors may drive them to hunt during daylight hours.

Lightsaber Form. Before Jedi Master Mace Windu refined it into Vaapad, the Form VII style of lightsaber combat was referred to as the Way of the Vornskr.

    <description>Voxyn are a genetic cross between a fero xyn and a vornskr—both deadly predators—shaped into being by the sentient Yuuzhan Vong species. Designed to hunt and kill the Force-sensitive Jedi of the galaxy, the reptilian hounds are all clones of the voxyn queen.

Biology. The cells of voxyn deteriorate at a rapid rate if they are not exposed to a nutrient from the planet Myrkr, and as such, voxyn in other parts of the galaxy typically do not survive for more than a few months. Voxyn are naturally sterile.

Characteristics. Standing one meter high, mature voxyn measure over four meters in length and are reptilian in appearance, although warm-blooded. A pair of oval yellow eyes with excellent night vision are located on the voxyn's flattish head, which has a broad snout over six inches long filled with fangs, and its lithe body is covered in black or green scales and sports eight clawed legs. The toe pads house a hundred deadly retroviruses, whose medium is the green slime that covers the voxyn's claws.

A series of sensory bristles covered in a powerful neurotoxin run down the creature's spine, ending in a whip-like tail that has a white, poisonous barb on it. The poison causes swelling and makes most creatures' flesh red for one to six days. The tail's barb can also be used to deliver a neural shock.

Voxyn also have long, forked tongues and are able to shoot out of its mouth a jet of brown, acid-like saliva that burns anything it touches. The creatures can also emit a sonic blast from their snouts, sending a compression wave that can temporarily disable a person's hearing, make them feel nauseous, and shatter eardrums. Voxyn's purple blood, when exposed to air, becomes a neurotoxin that smells like smoke and ammonia.

Voxyn are fast and agile on their feet, able to jump to great heights, and can swim in and under water.

Voxyn possess the ability to sense Force-sensitives through the Force. Jedi can sometimes feel voxyn as well, registering the creatures as a hungry or feral presence. However, voxyn can hide their presence from Forcesensitives.

    <description>Vulptices are a non-sentient species of omnivorous and gregarious canids from the mineral world Crait. They are distinguished by their coats made up of white crystalline bristles. Vulptices have excellent low-light vision and keen senses. They are omnivorous, feeding on tubers and small burrowing mammals they dig out from under Crait's salt crust. According to Doctor Paqin Mesoli, who wrote field notes on the vulptices for the Nupayuni Mining Consortium, these creatures might also be sensitive to magnetic fields.

    <description>The Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I, also known as the Vulture-class droid starfighter, or more simply as the vulture droid, is an unmanned model of droid starfighter manufactured by Haor Chall Engineering and utilized by the Trade Federation and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Constructed in the cathedral factories of Xi Char, their creation through precision manufacturing is considered an act of religious worship.

Like the ground forces made up of battle droids, vulture droids are sometimes remote controlled by a control ship. However, later generations of the fighter are able to operate with limited independence due to the installation of artificial intelligence. They are also known to be able to communicate with each other by chattering. While not in flight, vulture droids can transform into walking mode to patrol the surface or provide support during battles, and are specifically designed to fill both space and ground-based roles.

The vulture droid carries four blaster cannons and two energy torpedo launchers, and can reach 1200 kilo-meters per hour in a planet's atmosphere. In walker-mode, the Vulture-class could only use its two torpedo launchers as its cannons were situated on the legs and pointed downwards. While in this mode, the droid starfighter can also latch onto surfaces in zero gravity, allowing it to launch directly from the external hull of a capital ship. Vultures are also capable of being programmed to self-destruct if their link with their host control ship is severed.

Vulture droid starfighters are usually named by a sixdigit designation number, consisting of DFS- and a three-digit alpha-numeric combination, as illustrated by the fighters DFS-1VR and DFS-4CT.

    <description>Warrick Raden is a bully and an errand boy in Darga the Hutt's organization. For the most part, Raden is content to throw his weight around, but he is far too paranoid to draw too much attention to himself. A surprise visit by a group of strangers new to Cato Neimoidia is enough to spook Raden, causing him to suspect the worst. Like most other Devaronian males, he's spent a good amount of time exploring the galaxy, but some close run-ins with the authorities have made him extremely wary of dealing with authority figures.

    <description>Native to Tatooine, the womp rat is a breed of rodent, and considered hairy, monstrous pests. They moved on four legs tipped with three-clawed paws, and had long tails and ears. Typically not much bigger than two meters, they possessed big, sharp fangs used to seize prey, and had large, yellow eyes.

Womp rats were not timid creatures, hunting in packs and using their fangs to seize prey. When alone, a single womp rat was known to devour the garbage left by moisture farmers. When traveling in packs of up to 20 individuals, Womp Rats were known to overwhelm larger prey items, such as Dewbacks and Banthas. When they bite, their teeth set in and the animals will not release their hold, even if they are killed.

There were three species of womp rats: ones that lived in Beggar's Canyon, ones that lived in the Jundland Wastes, and swamp womp rats. The Jundland Wastes womp rat appeared shortly after Imperials arrived on Tatooine, and some have speculated it was a mutated form of the Beggar's Canyon womp rat, affected by chemicals from Imperial waste dumps. Some of its mutations include a larger size, slower reproduction rate, and lower numbers than Beggar's Canyon womp rat. Their ears are also elongated and winglike. Another variety, the swamp womp rat, was found on a few fringe worlds as well as on Cularin.

    <description>Native to Tatooine, the womp rat is a breed of rodent, and considered hairy, monstrous pests. They moved on four legs tipped with three-clawed paws, and had long tails and ears. Typically not much bigger than two meters, they possess big, sharp fangs used to seize prey, and had large, yellow eyes.

Womp rats are not timid creatures, hunting in packs and using their fangs to seize prey. When alone, a single womp rat is known to devour the garbage left by moisture farmers. When traveling in packs of up to 20 individuals, Womp Rats are known to overwhelm larger prey items, such as Dewbacks and Banthas. When they bite, their teeth set in and the animals will not release their hold, even if they are killed.

There were three species of womp rats: ones that lived in Beggar's Canyon, ones that lived in the Jundland Wastes, and swamp womp rats. The Jundland Wastes womp rat appeared shortly after Imperials arrived on Tatooine, and some have speculated it was a mutated form of the Beggar's Canyon womp rat, affected by chemicals from Imperial waste dumps. Some of its mutations include a larger size, slower reproduction rate, and lower numbers than Beggar's Canyon womp rat. Their ears are also elongated and winglike.

    <description>Wookiees are a tall species of furry humanoids from the planet Kashyyyk, who grow to a height of nearly three meters. They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably comes in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grow long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye color ranges from blue to brown. Wookiees are big eaters, with the average adult requiring 3,500-6,000 calories a day of food.

Wookiees have extendable claws which they use for climbing; using them for anything else violates the Wookiee honor code. Despite their fearsome appearance and volatile temperament, Wookiees are regarded as intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. When angered, Wookiees are known to descend into a berserker rage. Wookiees have a long lifespan, appearing not to age over a span of fifty years.

History. The softening and repeal of anti-slavery laws under the Empire ultimately led to classifying the Wookiees as non-sentient. The Empire enslaved the Wookiees not because they were a meaningful threat to the Empire but because their massive, robust physiology allowed them to work long and hard in extreme conditions. As a result, many Wookiees were forced into slavery building much of the Imperial war machine, sent to be worked to death in the dangerous spice mines of the planet Kessel, or on construction sites such as the Death Star. Numerous Wookiees were bred for use in medical experimentation, and some were used as playthings, hunted for sport, or forced into gladiatorial combat. Some of these wookiees turned towards darker pursuits after their rough treatment, such as the infamous bounty hunter Black Krrsantan.

Part of the muscle of the Iron Ring delegation, the Wookiee slaver is a big, brutish warrior who fought as a mercenary for the Separatists in the Clone Wars. His bowcaster is the only evidence that he embraces any aspect of his past, and his ability to drop foes quickly has made him an invaluable addition to the slaver ring.

    <description>Worrts are a non-sentient species that hail from the desert of the planet Tatooine, although they can also be found on Nal Hutta and Phaeda.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Worrts are squat and spiky creatures whose appearance bears similarities to that of chubas. They have brown, warty skin and measure 1.5 meters in height. They are quadrupeds with dexterous forelimbs. A worrt's head features a pair of sensitive cranial palps; two bulbous eyes, yellow in hue; two nostrils; and a large mouth containing a long tongue and strong teeth laced with a venom potent enough to kill a bantha. Worrts lay large amounts of soft eggs, which are harvested for food and used as ingredients in drinks such as Jabba Juice.

Behavior. Worrts feed mostly on insects and rodents. When hungry, a worrt settles into the sand, becoming indistinguishable from a rocky outcropping, and waits for prey to pass. When its victim comes close enough, the worrt throws its tongue out of its mouth and wraps it around the prey. The worrt's tongue then snaps back, throwing the food down its throat.

    <description>Worrts are a non-sentient species that hail from the desert of the planet Tatooine, although they can also be found on Nal Hutta and Phaeda.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Worrts are squat and spiky creatures whose appearance bears similarities to that of chubas. They have brown, warty skin and measure 1.5 meters in height. They are quadrupeds with dexterous forelimbs. A worrt's head features a pair of sensitive cranial palps; two bulbous eyes, yellow in hue; two nostrils; and a large mouth containing a long tongue and strong teeth laced with a venom potent enough to kill a bantha. Worrts lay large amounts of soft eggs, which are harvested for food and used as ingredients in drinks such as Jabba Juice.

Behavior. Worrts feed mostly on insects and rodents. When hungry, a worrt settles into the sand, becoming indistinguishable from a rocky outcropping, and waits for prey to pass. When its victim comes close enough, the worrt throws its tongue out of its mouth and wraps it around the prey. The worrt's tongue then snaps back, throwing the food down its throat.

    <description>Wraids are large reptilian creatures found on many desert planets around the galaxy, including Tatooine, Korriban, and Tython.

Biology &amp; Appearance. Wraids are pinkish-red in color and have very powerful front legs, enabling them to move quickly when agitated by means of long, bounding strides. They have large claws at the end of their feet and sharp teeth, making them dangerous to the unwary. They also have two small back legs.

Behavior. Wraids are often seen in clusters from two to six members. Generally, they will not harm passersby unless provoked, at which point their danger becomes immediately apparent.

Hunting. Because of their ferocious appearance and short temper, they are a popular quarry of lessexperienced big game sport hunters from around the galaxy. When the settlement of Anchorhead was founded, hunting wraids developed into a marketable trade with the opening of hunting lodges and salespeople dealing in wraid skull plates purchased from hunters.

Their skull plates are rumored to have medicinal uses, but the market for them is very specific.

    <description>Also known as webweavers, or Kashyyykian giant weavers, Wyyyschokk are arachnids that live in the lower levels of Kashyyyk's "multilayered deathtrap" ecosystem.

Wyyyschokk hold the distinction of being the most dangerous predator on Kashyyyk, signifying them as one of the most dangerous in the galaxy.

Behavior. They are intelligent enough to coordinate ambushes on unsuspecting creatures, and have the tenacity to track their prey for over a kilometer. When attacking, they immobilize their victims with thick strands of web and copious amounts of poisonous fluid from their upraised mandibles.

Range. While most wyyyschokk live deep in the lower levels of the wroshyr forests, some populations can also be found in the Etyyy region where no kilometer-high forests grow, while others live in the ShadowWeave Caverns in the Kkowir Forest.

    <description>Excavation droids are class V droids built for breaking rock and removing dirt and debris from various sources including mines, construction sites, and demolition zones.

XK-V8 EXCAVATION DROID
After the devastation of the Clone Wars, what was left of the Cato Neimoidian government decided to turn some of the Confederacy's droid production power toward rebuilding their bridge cities. One of the droids manufactured under this initiative is the TaggeCo XK-V8 Excavation Droid, produced in partnership with TaggeCo specifically for use on Cato Neimoidia. The excavation droid has climbing claws and magnetic feet that allow it to work on the top and the underside of the planet's bridge cities.

This spider-like droid resembles a massive arachnid with three-pronged claws at the end of each appendage. The droid's underbelly bristles with tools, such as circular saws and arc welders. Atop the droid sit several large visual sensors, facing forward and glowing a faint blue color.

    <description>Ysalamiri are furry, lizard-like tree-dwellers about 50cm in length, native to the planet Myrkr, and most known for their ability to create a Force-neutral bubble. This ability evolved in response to predation by the Forcesensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances — sometimes by kilometers.

Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble.

Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers. Miriskin was a commodity made from ysalamir skin.
