    <text>The power captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the power ends.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

    <text>As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within your weapon's reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in a thick acidic slime until the start of your next turn. Until the start of your next turn, if the target succeeds in grappling or maintaining a grapple, the slime is pressed into its body, causing it to immediately take 1d8 acid damage. 

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 acid damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for taking grappling or maintaining a grapple increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

    <text>Prerequisite: Force Disarm

You select a melee weapon you wield, or one melee weapon within range that is not worn or carried by a conscious creature, and use the Force to cause it to levitate, acting as an extension of your will for the duration or until you cast this power again. When you use this power, you can cause the weapon to move up to 20 feet and make a melee force attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage dealt by the weapon.

While the weapon is animated, on each of your turns you can use a bonus action to move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. At any time, you can end this force power to return the animated weapon to your hand.

An enemy can attempt to gain control of the weapon by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your force save DC. On a success, the creature gains control of the weapon and the power ends.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon's damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

    <text>This power attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as rancors, kath hounds, or twi'leks. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura's effect.

Antipathy. The power causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

Sympathy. The power causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target. 

If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as unnatural. In addition, a creature affected by the power is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the power persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

    <text>An immobile, Invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of energy springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any powers cast into or out of the area.

When you cast the power, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by unenhanced means. If the creature tries to teleport to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that power to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the power or effect. 

This power can't be dispelled.

The power fails if your location can't accommodate the cloud's size or height. When you cast the power, choose a point under the cloud for lightning to strike. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity save, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a fail and half on a success. While the power persists, you can use your action to call lightning to a point in range again.

If you're outdoors and in a storm, the power gives you control of the storm rather than creating a new one. The lightning damage also increases by 1d10.

A creature restrained by this power must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this power three times, the power ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If the creature is physically broken while frozen in carbonite, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

If you maintain your concentration on this power for the entire possible duration, the creature is frozen in carbonite until the effect is removed.

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and influence with the Force a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to harm itself automatically negates the effect of the power.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a soldier give her speeder to the first vagrant she meets. If the condition isn't met before the power expires, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the power ends. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the power doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the power. If it can't, the power is wasted.	

A creature affected by this power makes another Dexterity saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

A creature targeted by this power must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 acid damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.

This power automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller object. If the target is a Huge or larger object, this power disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. 

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.

You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as you are within 1 mile of it. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a 6th-level force slot, the duration is 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level force slot, the duration is 1 hour. When you use a force slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours.

    <text>Prerequisite: Eruption

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.

When you cast this power and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

This power can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.

Fissures: Fissures open throughout the power's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the power. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the power's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

Structures: The tremor deals 50 kinetic damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the power and at the start of each of your turns until the power ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 kinetic damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.

Each creature that starts its turn in the mesh or that enters it during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the mesh or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the mesh can use its action to make a Strength check against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The mesh is flammable. Any 5-foot cube of electromesh exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

    <text>Prerequisite: Convulsion

You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10 - foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.

If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 kinetic damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the power's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.

    <classes>Engineer (Star Wars 5e)</classes>
    <text>When you cast this power, you create a trap that will later trigger in response to a certain condition. You must attach it either to a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed or turned on (such as a book, door, or computer terminal) to conceal the trap. The trap can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. At the GM's discretion, certain actions may cause the trap to break or be rendered inoperative.

The trap is well disguised, and generally and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the trap when you cast the power, such as entering a certain area or powering on the object. You can further refine the trigger so the trap activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature kind (for example, the trap could be set to go off only droids or gungans). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

You may only have one instance of this trap active at a time. If you cast another trap before the previous one is triggered, the other trap becomes inert.

When you create the trap, choose an explosive trap or a power trap:

Explosive Trap. When triggered, the trap erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the trap. The explosion spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the trap), or half as much damage on a successful one.

Power Trap. You can store a prepared tech power of 3rd level or lower in the trap by casting it as part of creating the trap. The trap must target a single creature or an area. The power being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the trap is triggered, the stored power is cast. If the trap has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the trap. If the power affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the power requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive trap increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a power trap, you can store any power of up to the same level as the slot you use for this power.

    <text>An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence around you and remains for the duration. The barrier moves with you.

Any force power of 3rd level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect you, even if the power is cast using a higher level force slot. Such a power can target you, but the power has no effect on you. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 4th.

Until the power ends or you use an action to dismiss it, you can disguise yourself through use of the Force in many ways. You can appear to be shorter or taller by about a foot and change the appearance of your body and weight, but you cannot change the basic structure of your body. This effect can include your clothes, weapons, and other belongings on your person.

This effect is only visual, so any sort of physical contact will only interact with the real size and shape of you. A creature that uses its action to examine you can identify this effect with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force save DC. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

    <text>You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the power ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

    <text>Choose one creature, object, or force effect within range. Any force power of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each force power of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your forcecasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the power's level. On a success, the power ends.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a force power on the target if the power's level is equal to or less than the level of the force slot you used.

    <text>You select a weapon being worn or carried by a Large or smaller creature within range. The creature must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the creature chooses the ability to use). If the item is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 force damage and the item is pulled directly to you. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

This power's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

    <text>You imbue your weapon with the purifying light of the Force. As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes wreathed in a glowing barrier of force energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes 1d8 force damage, and the power ends.

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

Choose one or more creatures or objects within 60 feet that weigh up to 15 pounds. The object immediately moves 60 feet in a direction of your choice. If the object ends this movement in the air, it immediately falls to the ground. If the object collides with anything during its travel, both the object and the target take 3d8 kinetic damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d8 kinetic damage, or half as much on a successful one.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight increases by 15 pounds and the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

    <text>For the duration, you can detect electronic transmissions. When you cast the power and as your action on each turn until the power ends, you can focus on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose does not possess a commlink, or is not a droid or construct, the creature is unaffected.

If the creature possesses a commlink or other communications device, you receive any transmissions it broadcasts or receives for the duration.

Additionally, if the target is a droid or construct, you can read its "thoughts." You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature; what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), and something that looms large in its mind (such as its current objectives). If it succeeds, the power ends. Either way, the target (or its pilot, if it has one) knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the power ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this power to detect the presence of droids, constructs, or creatures bearing communications devices you can't see. When you cast the power or as your action during the duration, you can search for transmissions within 30 feet of you. The power can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts or transmissions for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.

Each droid or construct in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. If a construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it—s using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

    <text>This power allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this power.

The power disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The power lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this power fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this power to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this power to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

While a target is affected by the power, the target treats the hallucination as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the hallucination. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the hallucination's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A hallucination created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a hallucination created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the hallucination can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the hallucination's area or within 5 feet of the hallucination, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a force power slot of 3rd level or higher, the range increases by 20 feet, the image dimensions increase by 5 feet, and you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd.

    <text>A sphere of shimmering energy springs into being and encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other power effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A disintegrate power targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.

    <text>Prerequisite: Force Immunity

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 15-foot radius around you and remains for the duration. The barrier moves with you.

Any force power of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level force slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the power has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

This power closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

    <text>Prerequisite: Horror

This power assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this power or be affected by it.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d8 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn. This power has no effect on constructs or droids.

D8 | Behavior
1    | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.
2-6	 | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.
7-8	| The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a power slot of 6th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each force slot level above 5th.

At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 lightning damage to the target, and the lightning damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    <text>Prerequisite: Animate Weapon

You snag several objects using the force and whip them into the air around you, controlling them to attack at your command. Choose up to ten unenhanced objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can't control any object larger than Huge. Each object animates and hovers near you, remaining within 100 feet of you for the duration. An animated object behaves as though it is was a construct, with AC, hit points, and attacks determined by its size, and a flying speed of 30 feet.

As a bonus action, you can mentally direct any object controlled by this power. If you control multiple objects, you can command any or all of them at the same time. You decide what action the object will take and where it will move. The objects act at the end of your turn. If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and kinetic damage determined by its size.

Tiny	    20	16	+6 to hit, 1d4 + 3 damage
Small	    25	15	+6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage
Medium	40	13	+5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage
Large	    50	10	+6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage
Huge	    80	10	+8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage

Force Potency: If you cast this power using a force slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>Prerequisite: Coerce Mind

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and influence with the Force up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to harm itself automatically negates the effect of the power.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before the power ends, the activity isn't performed. If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this power, the power ends for that creature. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a 7th-level force slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level force slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level force slot, the duration is a year and a day.

	• The creature has advantage on all saving throws
	• Other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them.

    <text>Prerequisite: Improved Force Immunity

A 10-foot-radius faintly shimmering barrier surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Targeted Effects: Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

Enhanced Areas: The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as force storm, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

Powers: Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

Enhanced Items: The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 vibrosword in the sphere functions as an unenhanced vibrosword.

An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced saberspear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

Enhanced Travel: Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

Tech Override/Sever Force: Powers and enhanced effects such as sever force have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other.

That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or the Use an Object Action.

When the power ends, each target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the power's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

    <text>You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a power.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this power, and a light winks out if it exceeds the power's range.

For the power's duration, or until you use an action to touch the target and dismiss the power, the target appears dead to all outward inspection and to powers used to determine the target's status. The target is blinded and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0. The target has resistance to all damage except psychic damage. If the target is diseased or poisoned when you cast the power, or becomes diseased or poisoned while under the power's effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the power ends. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

The oil is flammable. Any 5 foot square of the oil exposed to fire burns away in one round. Each creature who enters the fire or starts it turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

    <text>You choose one droid or construct you can see within range and attempt to remotely override its controls. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you for the duration.

While the droid is charmed, you have a wireless link with it as long as the two of you are on the same planet. Via your tech focus, you can use this link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as Attack that creature, Move over there, or Fetch that object. If the droid completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. 

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the droid takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. 

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Intelligence saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a 6th-level tech slot, the duration is 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level tech slot, the duration is 1 hour. When you use a tech slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours.

Choose up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by this power for the duration.

An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the power doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the power. If it can't, the power is wasted.

A creature affected by this power makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

    <text>You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the power how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

    <text>You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the power ends.

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 minutes. If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

This power also neutralizes any poisons and cures diseases that affected the creature at the time it died.

This power closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival – its head, for instance – the power automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a power, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the power is wasted.

A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.

A creature takes 3d6 fire and 3d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one sphere is affected only once.

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, you create four projectiles. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th level or higher, you create five projectiles.

    <text>Prerequisite: Plague

For the power's duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the power ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of scourge.

Asleep: The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.

Panicked: The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.

Sickened: The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.

    <text>You choose one droid or construct you can see within range and scramble its ability to differentiate targets. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the construct has the 'Piloted' trait, and has a pilot controlling it that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

    <text>A 10-foot-radius shimmering sphere of power suppression surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Targeted Effects. Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

Enhanced Areas. The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as _explosion_, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.

Powers. Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

Enhanced Items. The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 lightsaber in the sphere functions as an unenhanced lightsaber.

An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced vibrospear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

Enhanced Travel. Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

Tech Override/Diminish Tech. Powers and enhanced effects such as *tech override* have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other.

Any tech power of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the power is cast using a higher level tech slot. Such a power can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the power has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such powers.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks powers of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

    <text>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The secured area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the power.

When you cast this power, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

When commanded (no action required), *security protocols* creates the following effects within the secured area.

Corridors. Fog fills all the secured corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.

Doors. All doors in the secured area are locked, as if sealed by the *lock* power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory object function of the *minor hologram* power) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

Stairs. Electromesh fills all stairs in the secured area from top to bottom, as the *electromesh* power. This mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while *security protocols* lasts.

Other power effect. You can place your choice of one of the following enhanced effects within the secured area of the stronghold.
- Place *mobile lights* in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as *security protocols* lasts.
- Place *implant message* in two locations.
- Place *debilitating gas* in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while *security protocols* lasts.

The whole secured area radiates power. A *dimish tech* cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and secured structure by casting this power there every day for one year.

A tendril of inky darkness reaches out from you, touching a creature you can see within range to drain life from it. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 2d8 necrotic damage, and the power ends. On a failed save, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage, and until the power ends, you can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal 4d8 necrotic damage to the target. The power ends if you use your action to do anything else, if the target is ever outside the power's range, or if the target has total cover from you.

Whenever the power deals damage to a target, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage the target takes.

Force Potency: When you cast this power using a force slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

    <text>A creature you touch isn't inconvenienced by mundane delays. Traffic lights are always green, there's always a waiting elevator, and a taxi is always around the corner. The target can run at full speed through dense crowds and attacks of opportunity provoked by the target's movement are made with disadvantage.

The power also grants advantage to stealth checks, since cover is always available. Additionally, the target has advantage on all ability checks made to drive a vehicle.

If two or more creatures under the effect of the power are attempting to avoid being inconvenienced by each other, the creatures make Charisma checks each time the effects would oppose each other. The higher check of the two's power takes effect.

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures and objects with the Force. When you cast this power, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the power.

Creature: You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this power. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

Object: You move an object that isn't being worn or carried and weighs up to 1,000 lbs up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this power.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

Your tracker droid acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A tracker droid can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

While your tracker droid is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it via your tech focus. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your droid's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the droid has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

You can't maintain an interface between more than one tracker droid and your tech focus at a time. 

Finally, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your tracker can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your tracker droid must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, you can maintain a link with one more tracker droid for every two slot levels above 1st. Multiple tracker droids act on the same initiative. You can only see through one droid's vision at a time, but you can toggle between droids as a bonus action. Each droid must still be within 100 feet of you.

Additionally, when you cast the tracker droid interface tech power, you can modify the tracker droid, and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:

	• You can make the tracker droid invisible.
	• You can stow one object the tracker droid is carrying in a container worn or carried by another creature.
	• You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.
	• You can use demolitions kits, security kits, and slicer's kits at range.
	• You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if your tracker droid succeeds on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check.

    <text>You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 kinetic damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

Force Potency. When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

An affected creature is aware of the power and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

    <text>A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the power ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.

A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the power ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the power ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.

A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your force save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6x10 feet away from it in a random direction.

On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.

Force Potency: If you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, the power deals an extra 2d6 damage for each slot level above 6th.
