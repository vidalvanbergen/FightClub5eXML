You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the operative class table in the Player's Handbook or Star Wars 5e.com .</text>

        <name>Forcecasting (Beguiler Practice)</name>
        <text>When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you have derived powers from your emotional connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

Force Powers Known:
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

Force Points:
You have a number of force points equal to your operative level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

Max Power Level:
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table.
	You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

Forcecasting Ability:
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

	Force save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

	Force attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier</text>

Choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched your display for the duration, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.

If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.

For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your prof-iciency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers on your next turn.

	• Your unarmed strikes use a d4 for damage.
	• You can deal Sneak Attack damage when making an unarmed strike. Additionally, you don't need advantage on your unarmed attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.

	Some of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

	Grapple Technique save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

Constrict:
You attempt to choke the target into unconscious-ness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.
	If you maintain this technique for 1 minute, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this way.

Disarm:
You attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.

Hip Toss:
You attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.</text>

Once per round, when you are the target of a ranged attack, or you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw, and there is cover within 10 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet (no action required). You must end this movement in cover.

        <name>Trick Shooter (Gunslinger Practice)</name>
        <text>Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of trick shots you can use to debilitate enemies and impress allies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a trick shot.

Some of your trick shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Trick Shot save DC: = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

Blinding Shot:
You attempt to blind the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.

Brutal Shot:
You attempt to knock the target prone. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Hampering Shot:
You attempt to hobble the enemy's movement. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, its movement speed is reduced by half and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.</text>
