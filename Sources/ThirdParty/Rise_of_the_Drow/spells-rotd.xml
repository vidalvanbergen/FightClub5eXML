    <text>This spell soothes and quiets undead, bathing them in a soft cerulean light that emanates from the caster, rendering them docile and harmless. Only mindless undead or those with Intelligence score of 2 or less can be affected by this spell. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, becoming incapacitated on a failed save. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened undead, who return to their previous behavior when the spell ends.

At Higher Level:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional target for each slot above 1st.

At the beginning of each of the target's turns, it can attempt a Dexterity saving throw to escape. The mushroom automatically hits with its bite attack against a creature it has grappled.

If this spell is cast on a fungoid creature, such as a funglet or vegepygmy, it can make a bite attack as a bonus action once per round.

This protection extends to physical attacks as well as spells and effects that deal radiant and lightning damage. When the shadow absorbs the maximum amount of hit points possible, it dissipates, leaving you without a shadow until you complete a short rest.

    <text>You touch a creature and stimulate its natural aging processes. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target loses up to 36 (8d8) hit points; if the target would be reduced to 0 hit points, they instead have 1 hit point. For the duration of the spell, the target loses 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute) and it gains no benefit from resting.

The target's appendages (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, rot and fall away after 10 minutes. If you keep the rotted part and hold it to the stump at the spell end, it instantaneously causes the main body of the affected creature to become poisoned for 24 hours.

The spell can also be ended by heal (as a 7th-level spell) or more powerful magic.

Poisoned:
	• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on Attack rolls and Ability Checks.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the grasping fungi until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the fungi takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by the fungi can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

    <text>You touch fungal material and transform it into ironfiber, a magical substance created by druids from normal plant matter. While remaining naturally fibrous in almost every way, ironfiber is as strong, heavy, and as resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on ironfiber. Spells that affect plants do affect ironfiber, although ironfiber does not burn. Using this spell with fiber shape or crafting, you can fashion fibrous items that function as metal items. Thus, fibrous plate armor and fibrous swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts.

    <text>You and all other subjects in range gather together in a circle and meld minds, pooling your collective memories in a matrix that exchanges information at the speed of light. You may make a number of Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma-checks equal to the total number of subjects (minimum 2). You automatically benefit from the help action on these checks and are proficient in any skills a participant is proficient in. You also use the highest Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma modifier of the participants for these checks. There lies danger in this melding of minds—for each check you fail, you take 4d6 psychic damage, as your mind has trouble reconciling the massive influx of information and redistributing it among the participants.

Colliatur are uniquely suited for this type of information sharing—for each colliatur participating in this ritual beyond the first, reduce the psychic damage incurred on a failure by 1d6.

    <text>You absorb your own shadow into your body, causing you to be suffused by the intangible bulk of darkness. Your shadow-enhanced size doubles in all dimensions and increases your size by one category. For example, from Medium to Large.

If there isn't enough room for you to double your size, you instead attain the maximum possible size in the space available. Your dimensions continue to adjust to your surroundings. Note that, since the size increase is based on your shadow suffusing you, it does not actually increase your size and hence, does not hinder your progress through tight spaces. Until the spell ends, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Your weapons also grow to match your seemingly new size. While thus enlarged, your attacks with them deal an extra 1d6 cold damage.

The hallucinating creature suffers disadvantage to all Strength and Dexterity saving throws and skill checks and automatically fails all Wisdom saving throws.

Distracting Shadows:
The target sees movement amongst the shadows, making it harder to focus on any one thing. For one round, the target makes attacks with disadvantage and it cannot concentrate.

Threatening Shadows:
The target sees threats that are not there, which lowers their defenses against threats that are. The next weapon attack against the target is made with advantage.

At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot above 1st. You must make a ranged spell attack for each target.

    <text>You rip your shadow from your body and cast it into the body of a deceased creature in range that has not been dead for more than 5 minutes. The creature is animated by your shadow as a macabre puppet with the deceased being's full set of actions, abilities, feats and spells remaining when the creature died. The animated creature has half your hit points upon casting this spell, which also are the puppet's maximum hit points, and it takes its turn directly after your turn. You must use a reaction in order for the shadow puppet to use a reaction.

Since the animated puppet is powered in equal parts by fading life energy as well as your shadow, shadow raising only works for brief periods of time After a total of 20 minutes, the corpse collapses and your shadow reassembles and returns to you. If the shadow puppet is destroyed, you lose your shadow until you complete a short rest.

    <text>Your magic-infused shadow confines the target in shackles. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, your shadow anchors the target to the spot, reducing its speed to 0.

While held in place by the shackles, the target takes 3d6 cold damage at the start of each of its turns. Shadow shackles have an AC of 18, a damage threshold of 10 and 20 hit points. If the shackles are destroyed, the spell ends and you lose your shadow until you complete a short rest.

    <text>You exhale a cloud of spores in a 15-foot cone. The cloud moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground at the start of each of your turns in the same direction it last moved. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the cloud up to 10 feet and change its direction.

Spores of madness simultaneously replicates the effects of cloudkill and confusion. A creature exposed to the cloud must make both a Constitution and Wisdom saving throw to resist the respective effects of those spells.

    <text>You enter a shadow large enough to contain you and teleport yourself from you current location to any other shadowy spot within range of the spell. If can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating the distance and direction, so long as the destination is also a shadow large enough to contain you.

If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.

Stepping into the shadow is a Disengage, and you may Hide as a bonus action upon arrival.

You can cast this spell as an action on a creature you can touch, granting them the benefits of this spell, but casting the spell in this way causes you to lose your shadow until you complete a short rest.
