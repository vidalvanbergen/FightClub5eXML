        <name>Roguish Archetype: Spellthief</name>
        <text>Some never learn how to cast a spell but instead instinctively learn how to handle them, almost as if they were physical objects. The ancient magehunters of the Vordani tribes perfected this special technique, which later spread all over the continent. A spellthief understands the nature of spells and can reach into a spellcaster's magical pool to take some of it and use it. The most experienced spellthieves can shake off ranged spells with ease and redirect them as if they have cast it themselves.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Spellthief: Sneaky Interrupt</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, your understanding of magic theories equals that of a trained wizard and as such, you know when it's best to strike at them. You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you aren't already proficient in it and gain an advantage on your attack rolls against targets maintaining concentration on a spell.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Spellthief: Steal Spell</name>
        <text>Starting at 9th level, you can siphon a single spell from a spellcaster with a precise strike. As a bonus action, after you hit a creature with a melee weapon, you can force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC is 8 + proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.

On a failed save or when you touch a willing creature, you gain a 1st level spell slot and a prepared 1st level spell chosen by you from the creature's known or prepared 1st level spells.

At 13th level, the spell level you can steal increases to 2nd level spells, and at 17th level to 3rd level spells.

The creature loses a 1st level spell slot, but still knows the spell and can use it normally. For the next 8 hours, you have the spell prepared and can cast it using your spell slots.

If the creature is not a spellcaster you don't gain any benefits from this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

        <text>Starting at 13th level, you can untie the fabric of magic and take it over from your opponent spellcaster, keeping it maintained for your own benefit. As a bonus action, after you hit a creature who is maintaining concentration on a spell with a melee weapon, you can choose not to deal extra damage from your Sneak Attack. Instead, you force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC is 8 + proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier. On a failed save, the maintained spell ends on the creature and you gain the spell's benefits for 1 minute.

Once you successfully use this feature to unhook a spell, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

        <text>Spies are masters of infiltration and stealth, able to get out of seemingly impossible situations with the intelligence they seek. They train their memories to remember even the most minute details at a glance, making them valuable agents to recover information.

Some masters of their trade can even pierce the minds of their marks, allowing them to more effectively infiltrate the ranks of organizations they target.

While the target is in range, you can continue reading its thoughts, as long as your concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell).
