      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Monastic Tradition: Stonefist (UA)</name>
        <text>A small monastery of the Stonefists exists in the Shandar Mountains, which is related to some unspeakable horrors of legend that supposedly lurk on the top of the highest peaks. The monks of the Stonefist practice the fighting techniques of earth elementals by studying and imitating their combat maneuvers. Their daily practice involves hardening their bodies to withstand blows and the rigorous focusing of their strength. Masters of this monastic tradition become almost impervious to non-magical attacks and reach a level of ascendance where they can turn themselves into earth elementals.

        <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Nine Seals (UA)</name>
        <text>Only a handful of devil-bound individuals practice the Way of the Nine Seals in Aglarion or the neighboring regions. This monastic tradition was forged in the flames of Hell, and it is infused with the accuracy and mettle of the fiends who practice it. Devils teach it only to those who pledge eternal servitude in return for the knowledge of the secret combat techniques. A monk of the Nine Seals is hard to fool and even harder to overcome. Masters of the Nine Seals are offered a fate-bound contract by their superiors, allowing them to alter their fate. In return, they are obedient tools of the armies of Hell.
