        <text>Some creatures are born with an innate connection to the Weave and can use their own bodies as a spellcasting focus. These sorcerers often find their abilities well suited to life in the wild frontier or as clandestine agents for powerful organizations.

Any number of factors can bestow this gift upon a creature. Known spellslingers often cite events such as the following for their gifts: surviving a magical cataclysm, a blessing of a powerful fey monarch, an ancestor's bargain with an otherworldly being, or sheer dumb luck.

        <text>You have the unique ability to twist your magic in ways no other sorcerer could. These are called Slings, and many enhance or modify your spells in some way. You gain two Slings now and an additional one at 14th level. (You can find these under class spells in the 'Sling' list.) When you gain metamagic options at 10th and 17th levels, you can choose from either the Metamagic list or Sling list.

You can use only one Sling or Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Wild Magic Remastered</name>
        <text>One of the most common complaints about the Wild Magic sorcerer is that it has an excellent narrative, but much weaker mechanics than its counterparts, and that its relies heavily on having a highly skilled Dungeon Master. That's a lot of pressure for a DM! This remastered version aims to ameliorate these problems in the following ways:

	• Rephrase the Wild Magic Surge feature as a Wild Magic Trigger feature to reduce confusion about when you should roll 1d20 or 1d100.

	•Restructure the Wild Magic Surge and Tides of Chaos features so they don't have to rely so heavily on the Dungeon Master. Now you always have a 5% chance of a spell going wildly out of control, not a 5% chance only at the DM's discretion. After you've used your Tides of Chaos feature, this chance increases to 10%, but the DM can still indicate your magic goes wildly out of control anyways.

	•Increase the power of the Bend Luck feature to be more comparable to the Divine Soul sorcerer's Favoured By The Gods feature and bards' Bardic Inspiration feature.

	•Other minor balance adjustments to further pursue the 'risk vs. reward' narrative and design philosophy.

        <name>Wild Magic Remastered: Wild Magic Trigger</name>
        <text>Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Each time you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20 immediately after. This is called a Wild Magic Trigger roll. If you roll a 1 on the die, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table (1d100) to create a magical effect. If the effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

Wild Magic Surge:
d100 | Effect
01-02 | Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.
03-04 | For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it.
05-06 | A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.
07-08 | You cast fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself.
09-10 | You cast magic missile as a 5th-level spell.

19-20 | You cast grease centered on yourself.
21-22 | Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.
23-24 | Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A remove curse spell can end this effect.
25-26 | An eye appears on your forehead for the next minute. During that time, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
27-28 | For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of 1 action have a casting time of 1 bonus action.
29-30 | You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see.
31-32 | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
33-34 | Maximize the damage of the next damaging spell you cast within the next minute.
35-36 | Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger (minimum 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older.
37-38 | 1d6 flumph controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute.
39-40 | You regain 2d10 hit points.
41-42 | You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts.
43-44 | For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns.
45-46 | You cast levitate on yourself.
47-48 | A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.
49-50 | You can't speak for the next minute. Whenever you try, pink bubbles float out of your mouth.
51-52 | A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to magic missile.
53-54 | You are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 5d6 days.
55-56 | Your hair falls out but grows back within 24 hours.
57-58 | For the next minute, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame.

85-86 | You cast mirror image.
87-88 | You cast fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you.
89-90 | You become invisible for the next minute. During that time, other creatures can't hear you. The invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.
91-92 | If you die within the next minute, you immediately come back to life as if by the reincarnate spell.
93-94 | Your size increases by one size category for the next minute.

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Bestial Spirit</name>
        <text>Power drawn from the great Beastlands or another plane of great beasital power has been passed down your lineage since an ancestor made a deal with a great animal god, or perhaps spent an amount of time within the great library. Either way, a powerful bestial spirit resides within you. Occasionally appearing as cat-like eyes, higher reflexes, excessive hair growth, or sharpened nails and teeth, this spirit brings about a new commune with nature and the animals that reside within.

        <text>You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Bestial Spirit Spells table. Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can't be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

Sorcerer Level | Spells
1st | animal friendship, speak with animals
3rd | animal messenger, beast sense

        <name>Bestial Spirit: Fury of the Pack</name>
        <text>As an action, you can spend up to 10 sorcery points and summon celestial spirits that take the form of beasts or swarms of beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 120 feet. The summoned spirits can have a combined challenge rating equal to or lower than the sorcery points spent. For example, if you spend 5 sorcery points, you could summon one CR 5 beast, or two CR 2 beasts and one CR 1 beast, or some other combination. Any beast or swarm of beasts with a challenge rating lower than 1 costs 1 sorcery point to summon.

A beast or swarm of beasts conjured in this way is considered celestial, appears slightly transparent, and disappears after 1 minute or when it drops to 0 hit points. You can also dismiss any number of creatures summoned in this way as an action. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Rakshasa Bloodline</name>
        <text>Your innate magic comes from the meddling of a devious rakshasa, a manipulative and tiger-like fiend that uses illusions and enchantments to torment its prey. One of the devilish creatures might have claimed you as a prize after scheming against your family, then imbued you with power for its own nefarious ends; maybe somewhere in your ancestry, a rakshasa took on the guise of a family member long enough to taint your line; or perhaps one of your ancestors slew a rakshasa and was cursed to bear children that resemble the infernal monster. However they came to be, the raksha- sa's powers of misdirection and manipulation course through your veins.

The rakshasa bloodline can physically manifest itself in different ways. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Rakshasa Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

Rakshasa Bloodline Quirks:
d6 | Quirks
1 | Your hands are backwards, with palms where the backs of your hands would normally be.
2 | You have tiger-like stripes that stretch across your skin or hair.
3 | You have gleaming, cat-like eyes that reflect light in the dark.
4 | You have a habit of growling when angered and purring when content.
5 | When someone states an obvious fact, you feel compelled to convince them otherwise.
6 | Your ears, hair, nose, or some other facial feature has a different look every day.

You can then immediately use your reaction to spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level (or 1 point for a cantrip) and become immune to that casting of the spell. The highest level of a spell you can become immune to using this feature equals your sorcerer level divided by 3, rounded down.
