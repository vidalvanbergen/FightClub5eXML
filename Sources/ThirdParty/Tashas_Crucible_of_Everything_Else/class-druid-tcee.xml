        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Bough</name>
        <text>There are druids who seek to bond not with beasts, but with the timeless sentinels that blanket the land: the ancient, gnarled trees whose wisdom is beyond compare. These druids—druids of the Bough—learn to shapeshift into the very trees that they revere.

        <name>Circle of the Bough: Bonus Cantrip</name>
        <text>Beginning at 2nd level, when you choose this druid circle, you learn the shillelagh cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different cantrip from the druid spell list. It does not count against the number of druid cantrips you know.

        <name>Circle of the Bough: Treant Form</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can harden your skin into bark and become a treant-like creature.

As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to gain tree-like traits, rather than transforming into a beast form. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

	• You gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class.
	• Your Armor Class is equal to 14 + your Wisdom modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
	• As a reaction when you take bludgeoning, slashing or piercing damage, you can halve the attack's damage against you.
	• Your unarmed strikes are under the effects of a shillelagh spell.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

        <name>Circle of the Bough: Wild Growth</name>
        <text>When you enter your Treant Shape, you can cause rootlets to sprout out of the ground in a 10 foot radius around you. This ground becomes difficult terrain for all creatures but yourself. If you move, the circle moves with you.

Additionally, while in your Treant Shape, you can increase your size to Large as a bonus action. When you transform in this way, your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage.

        <text>When you enter your Treant Shape, you can ground yourself, growing roots that cling to the surface beneath you. While rooted in this way, you have the following traits:

	• You have tremor sense out to a range of 60 feet.
	• You can telepathically converse with trees within 1 mile of you, as if by a speak with plants spell.
	• You cannot be knocked prone or moved against your will.
	• You have advantage on saving throws made to maintain your concentration on spells.

        <name>Circle of the Bough: March of the Treants</name>
        <text>Starting at 14th level, when you're in your Treant Form, you can use an action to temporarily animate nearby trees.

Choose up to two Medium or larger trees you can see within 30 feet of you. They become awakened trees that are friendly to you and your companions. They act on your initiative count, but take their turn immediately after you. The trees return to mundanity after 1 minute or when they are reduced to 0 hit points. The Dungeon Master has the statistics for these creatures. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Dragonfriend</name>
        <text>Dragons are powerful magical beings that shape the environment around them and their lairs. A few brave druids work with these creatures and tend to those environments. Such druids often pick up tips, tricks, and magical traits from their companions. These druids are known as dragonfriends.

It is rare to find a dragonfriend trying to dominate a dragon, or that condescends to be ruled by one. While dragonfriends usually maintain a realistic understanding that dragons' powers are much greater than their own, they maintain peaceful coexistence and peership with dragons. Those who live near evil dragons often make arrangements for tenuous, indefinite alliances.

In the world of Eberron, dragonfriends often work with dragons to study and record the Draconic Prophecy. The first dragonfriends were students of Vvaraak, the ancient green dragon that brought druidic magic to the orcs of the Shadow Marches.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Circle of the Dragonfriend: Dragon Type</name>
        <text>Every dragonfriend has a type of dragon that shapes their magical abilities. This type determines your 6th-level feature and some features of your Draco forms. When you select this subclass at 2nd level, choose one of the following types of dragon: black, blue, brass, bronze, copper, gold, green, red, silver, white, faerie, sapphire, shadow, or turtle.

Dragon Type:
Dragon Type | Damage Type | Draco Breath Weapon | 6th-Level Feature
Black | Acid | Line | Amphibious
Blue | Lightning | Line | Amphibious
Brass | Fire| Line | Amphibious
Bronze | Lightning | Line | Amphibious
Copper | Acid | Line | Amphibious
Gold | Fire | Line | Amphibious
Green | Poison | Cone | Amphibious
Red | Fire | Cone | Amphibious
Silver | Cold | Cone | Amphibious
White | Cold | Cone | Amphibious
Faerie | Radiant | Cone | Invisibility or Psionics (your choice)
Sapphire | Thunder | Cone | Psionics or Tunneling (your choice)
Shadow | Necrotic | Line | Climbing or Stealth (your choice)
Turtle | Fire* | Cone | Amphibious

*The breath weapon of a turtle dragon is a blast of scalding steam that does not set objects on fire. Being in water does not give a creature resistance to this breath weapon's fire damage.

        <text>You gain an additional Wild Shape option, which uses the stat block below. Instead of assuming the shape of a beast, you gain a draconic appearance, with fangs, horns, and shining scales. In this form, you can only speak Draconic, but can use your hands as normal. You retain your normal Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution ability scores, but otherwise follow all standard Wild Shape rules.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Circle of the Dragonfriend: Draconic Gift</name>
        <text>You gain a special gift for exploration, as determined by your Dragon Type. You have this trait both in your Wild Shape and normal forms.

Amphibious (Black, Bronze, Gold, Green):
You breathe both water and air. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and water does not count as difficult terrain for you.

Climbing (Copper, Red):
You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws against effects that would knock you prone.

Fog (Silver):
Fog, mist, rain, snow, and similar substances do not obscure your vision, and you can cast fog cloud without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Tunneling (Blue, Brass, White):
You gain a burrowing speed of 10 feet, and you can choose to leave a tunnel in your wake with a diameter just large enough to fit a creature of your size. This speed cannot be used to burrow through solid rock, ice, metal, wood, or similar substances.

Invisibility (Faerie*):
You can cast invisibility on yourself once each short rest without expending a spell slot.

Psionics (Faerie*, Sapphire*):
You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you, but this does not grant the creature any ability to tele- pathically reply. You must share at least one language with the creature to do this. Additionally, you learn the mage hand cantrip, which counts as a druid cantrip for you and does not count against the number of cantrips you can know. When you cast mage hand using this trait, the hand is invisible.

Stealth (Shadow*):
You gain proficiency in Stealth if you do not already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Stealth. 

* This Dragon Type gives you an option between two Draconic Gifts. You choose one.

        <text>You can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to take a Greater Draco form, which uses the stat block below. Instead of assuming the shape of a beast, you gain a draconic appearance, with fangs, horns, shining scales, and grand wings. In this form, you can only speak Draconic, but can use your hands as normal. You retain your normal Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution ability scores, but otherwise follow all standard Wild Shape rules.

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

    <!-- Circle of the Coven -->
    <autolevel level="2">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Coven</name>
        <text>Druids are known amongst the masses for their secret groups, sacred locales, and sacramental rites. None fit this description more so than the druids that gather together in the spirit of cult sorority, where the whole is exponentially more powerful than the mere sum of its parts which parts often consist of hags and other unseelie fey. These mystical magicians, while not known for infant-snatching like their namesake, do give more attention to the civilized world than the rest of their kind. Their skill with the cauldron, and their ability to take the form of humanoids in addition to beasts, allow them to closely observe and even infiltrate communities of all kinds. While the intentions of these druids are frequently debated amongst those who are familiar with them, their power is not.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Circle of the Coven: Double, Double</name>
        <text>As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to magically polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid. Your statistics are the same in this form, and your equipment magically resizes to fit your new form. You can remain in this form for a number of hours equal to half your druid level rounded down (minimum of 1 hour) and can end it early as an action. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 4 times your druid level, and you revert to your normal form early if you lose all of these temporary hit points. All other standard Wild Shape rules still apply while you are transformed in this way.

While you are transformed using your Wild Shape feature, whether into a beast or humanoid form, you gain a special action. While in your Wild Shape, you can use your action to briefly adopt a ghastly appearance, forcing all creatures within 30 feet that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

If you model your appearance after a specific humanoid, a suspicious creature can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, realizing that you are an imposter on a success.

        <text>You have learned the secret magics of hags, granting you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the minor illusion cantrip, and it doesn't count against the number of druid cantrips you know. You also learn the hex spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Coven Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Druid Level | Spells
3rd | hold person, ray of enfeeblement
5th | bestow curse, counterspell
7th | conjure woodland beings, phantasmal killer
