        <text>To you, the world is a lattice of systems, a complex constructuction of mathematical interactions. Numbers have meaning and power, and the weave of magic that permeates the multiverse is no different.

Some scholars believe that the world's ley lines are arranged in a mathematical pattern which, if understood, can yield great magical power. In the World of Eberron, the Draconic Prophecy is studied by mages, dragons, and scholars of all kinds. In the intricate markings of the Prophecy manifested across the world, could there be some numeric pattern just waiting to be understood?

The number of creatures nearby, the shape of the room, or even the hour of the day might all be factors that shape the searing flames of burning hands or guide the subtle influence of charm person. Numerologists, sometimes known as math magicians, use divination magic to observe the physical world around them, estimating and calculating potential interactions with the weave. The numbers change with every passing moment, however, forcing a numerologist to plan ahead and think as fast as a lightning bolt.

        <name>Numerology: Spell Arithmetic</name>
        <text>You can use a bonus action to divine your surroundings and calculate how to optimize your spells. Roll 5d6, your arithmetic dice. Immediately after doing so, you can reroll any number of the dice, though you must use any new rolls. When you cast a wizard spell during any of your subsequent turns, you can combine and spend your arithmetic dice in any of the following ways to augment the spell.

You can't use an arithmetic die more than once, and any unused dice are lost when you augment a spell in this way, use this feature again, or finish a long rest.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it whenever you finish a long rest.

Empowered Pair:
If two arithmetic dice show the same number (such as two 1s), you can spend those dice to reroll a number of the spell's damage dice equal to the number shown on the arithmetic dice. You must use any new damage die rolls.

Fortunate Sum:
If the value of two arithmetic dice add up to 7 (such as 1 and 6, or 2 and 5), you can spend those dice to increase your spell save DC and spell attack modifier by 1 for this casting of the spell.

Rising Run:
If four arithmetic dice show consecutive numbers (such as 1-2-3-4), you can spend those dice to cast the spell as though with a spell slot one level higher than the one you expend.

        <text>You learn the augury spell. It counts as a wizard spell for you, you always have it prepared, it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day, and you don't need to have it in your spellbook to cast it as a ritual.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Numerology: Geometrist</name>
        <text>You can reshape your spells by altering their formula. When you prepare a wizard spell that creates an area of effect in the shape of a cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere, you can expend a use of your Spell Arithmetic to change one of those shapes into a different one, as shown in the Shape Conversions table. You can apply the changes whenever you cast the spell until you finish your next long rest.

When dividing measurements, round up to the nearest 5 feet. See chapter 10 of the Basic Rules or the Player's Handbook for the rules of areas of effect shapes.

Shape Conversions:
Original Shape | New Shape | New Shape Measurements
Cone | Line | Length = Cone Size x 3, Width = 5 feet
	| Cube | Size = Cone Size ÷ 2
	| Sphere | Radius = Cone Size ÷ 2
Cube | Line | Length = Cube Size x 6, Width = 5 feet
	| Cone | Size = Cone Size x 2
	| Sphere | Radius = Cone Size x 2
Cylinder or Sphere | Line | Length = Radius x 6, Width = 5 feet
	| Cone | Size = Radius x 2
	| Cube | Size = Radius
Line | Cone | Size = Length ÷ 3
	| Cube | Size = Length ÷ 6
	| Sphere | Radius = Length ÷ 6

If you create an area of effect centered on yourself, you can exclude yourself from it. These conversions otherwise don't affect a spell's range, For example, if you cast lightning bolt as a sphere, the sphere still originates from you, and if you cast the shatter spell as a line, the line still originates from a point within range.

Perfect Set:
You can spend five arithmetic dice that all show the same number (such as five 5s) to deal maximum damage with the spell instead of rolling damage dice.

Heightened Run:
You can spend five arithmetic dice that show consecutive numbers (such as 1-2-3-4-5) to choose one of the spell's targets and force it to make its first saving throw against the spell with disadvantage.

        <name>Arcane Tradition: Hellhunter</name>
        <text>Some wizards dedicate their lives to studying negative energies, chthonic planes, and fiends of all types. These mages are known for their acumen in navigating devilish agreements, wresting demon power, and hunting fiends of all kinds. Those who immerse themselves in the mantle of the hellhunter enter into a lifelong pursuit of understanding, harnessing, and utilizing all power that becomes available to them through the wicked realms of existence by any means possible. Tasha herself is a hellhunter who has garnered quite a reputation amongst the fiends of the negative planes, known for outmaneuvering archdevils and strong arming even the most powerful demon princes.

        <name>Hellhunter: Call the Abyss</name>
        <text>As an action, you can spend a spell slot to summon a fiend of your choice in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The maximum Challenge Rating for a fiend summoned in this way is the level of the spell slot used, and you can only have one fiend summoned at a time. Such a fiend is under no obliga- tion to listen to you or follow your commands, and it cannot summon other fiends. If one of these fiends is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears in a cloud of dust and reforms on its native plane in 1d12 days. It returns to where it came from after 1 hour. As an action, you can attempt to dismiss the fiend early. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or else be dismissed to wherever it was summoned from. It has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name.

Roleplaying Devils:
A devil (lawful evil) typically won't attack anything when summoned, at least not at first. It tries to make agreements and will keep its promises, if only on a technicality. Devils represent tyranny and are native to the Nine Hells of Baator.

Roleplaying Demons:
A demon (chaotic evil) typically is hostile to all creatures other than itself. Regardless of its Intelligence, it usually tries to attack anything in sight and will not make promises. Demons represent anarchy and are native to the Abyss.

Roleplaying Yugoloths:
A yugoloth (neutral evil) is typically indifferent to being summoned, but can quickly become hostile or friendly. It will lend its services to the highest bidder and will change its allegiances if it finds a better offer. Yugoloths represent self-interest and are native to Gehenna.

Long Memories:
If you summon the same fiend more than once, be wary. Fiends have long memories and will remember how you've treated them in the past.

        <name>Arcane Tradition: Mimicry</name>
        <text>The mimic. A devious hunter, every rogue's nightmare, and the last thing some creatures see before being swallowed whole. The first mimics were created by powerful mages, and they were intelligent creatures, combining tactical prowess with an all-consuming hunger to create terrifying and powerful devourers. While the secrets of how to create those beings have been lost to time, some mages have passed down a similar tradition that allows even novice wizards to create the monstrosities that many dungeon delvers have become familiar with, commanding these monstrosities as subordinates through sheer power of will.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Mimicry: Transmogrify</name>
        <text>As an action, you can spend a spell slot and touch a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried to turn it into an experimental mimic of the same size. This mimic uses the Arcane Mimic stat block, found below. Some details of this stat block vary based on the spell slot used to create the mimic and the size of the mimic, as described in the Transmogrification and Arcane Mimics tables.

The spell slot used determines the mimic's Strength score and the maximum size of item you can trans- mogrify, according to the Transmogrification table. The mimic's size determines its hit points and the bludgeoning or piercing damage dealt by its attacks, according to the Arcane Mimics table.

The change lasts for 1 hour, until the mimic is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you dismiss the effect as an action. You can only have one mimic created in this way at a time. You can communicate with your mimic telepathically as long as it is within 120 feet of you.

In combat, the mimic takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal or telepathic commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it moves toward the nearest hostile creature and bites it if possible.

Transmogrification:
Spell Slot Used | Maximum Size | Strength
1st | Tiny | 12 (+1)
2nd | Small | 14 (+2)
3rd | Medium | 16 (+3)
4th | Medium | 18 (+4)
5th | Large | 20 (+5)
6th | Large | 22 (+6)
7th | Huge | 24 (+7)
8th | Huge | 26 (+7)
9th | Gargantuan | 28 (+9)

Arcane Mimics:
Mimic Size | Hit Points | Attack Damage
Tiny | 4 times the level of the spell slot used | 1d4 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Small | 6 times the level of the spell slot used | 1d6 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Medium | 8 times the level of the spell slot used | 1d8 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Large | 10 times the level of the spell slot used | 2d8 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Huge | 12 times the level of the spell slot used | 3d8 + the mimic's Strength modifier
Gargantuan | 20 times the level of the spell slot used | 4d8 + the mimic's Strength modifier

Additionally, you can have up to two arcane mimics created at a time. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to magically heal one of your arcane mimics within 120 feet of you. The arcane mimic heals for a number of d8s equal to the level of the spell slot expended.

        <name>Mimicry: Polymorph Proficiency</name>
        <text>Your knowledge of how to change creatures into mundane objects and the basic natural forms of animals is cemented in your mind. You add the polymorph spell to your spellbook if you don't already have it, and you always have it prepared. This does not count against the number of spells you can prepare at once.

When you cast polymorph, you can transform the target creature into an object instead of a beast. This object counts as magical and must be no more than one size larger than the creature. Any attempt to undo the existence of the item without reducing its hit points, such as by the disintegration spell or by using it as a consumed material component for a spell, makes the effect fail and immediately ends the polymorph effect, as if the creature-object had been reduced to 0 hit points.

You can also target a nonmagical object with this spell to turn it into another object or into a beast of the same size with a challenge rating equal to or less than the level of the spell slot used.
