        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Enlightenment</name>
        <text>The Oath of Enlightenment is taken by paladins who seek for learning and growth and to share such knowledge and experience with others. As often as others call them teacher or mentor, they call themselves student and pupil.

These paladins spend much of their time trying to build up others, but they are also dedicated to bettering themselves. As they understand other people, they begin to comprehend their own place in the cosmos on a level rivaled by few. The greatest reach a transcendence that allows them to ignore limitations of the planes, levitating and teleporting as they wish.

Paladins of this oath seek learning as a means to improve their connection to and understanding of their god and the domains of their god's portfolio. Some carry sketch pads and notebooks to record their learnings, while others might bring mats or wear caps to help them focus as they meditate and ponder on recent discoveries.

        <name>Oath of Enlightenment: Tenets of Enlightenment</name>
        <text>The tenets of the Oath of Enlightenment teach a paladin to seek learning whenever they can and to share it just as often.

Knowledge is Power:
The greater your understanding, the greater your influence.

Lifelong Learning:
Enlightenment can only be achieved by persistent curiosity and a humble willingness to learn.

Teach the Untaught:
Nothing worth learning should be kept to yourself; your knowledge and experience ought to be shared with the world, that others might learn as you have.

Seek First to Understand:
Understanding others is more important than being right. Once you understand them, then you can teach them.

Enrich Understanding:
You can use your Channel Divinity as an action to share knowledge and experience with others. As an action, choose one skill, and yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The chosen creature gains proficiency with the chosen skill for 10 minutes.

Guiding Strike:
You can use your Channel Divinity to help teach and direct your allies in their strikes. When you hit with a weapon attack, choose an ally within 10 feet of you. The chosen ally can use its reaction to make one weapon attack with a bonus to the attack roll equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).

        <name>Oath of Enlightenment: Kindling Aura</name>
        <text>Whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you makes an Intelligence check, the creature gains a bonus to the roll equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

Additionally, when an ally within 10 feet of you hits a creature with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to expend a spell slot and cause the attack to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

    <!-- Oath of Unrest -->
    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Unrest</name>
        <text>The Oath of Unrest is taken by those with unfinished business. They are driven by an overwhelming thirst for revenge against those who wronged them, or to complete a final, critical task left unfinished. Some of these paladins might have even met a cruel and undeserved end, but return from beyond the grave to finish its work, much like a revenant. It may have been at the will of a deity, some darker force, or the paladin itself. Regardless, none who swear this oath are left untainted, whether it be by the Shadowfell, a realm of the dead, or the paladin's own ambitions.

This unusual state leaves dark marks on those who experience it. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Oath of Unrest Paladin Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

Oath of Unrest Paladin Quirks:
d6 | Quirk
1 | Your shadow moves in strange ways.
2 | Your eyes appear to be empty sockets.
3 | Your hair is ghostly white.
4 | Your skin is ice-cold to the touch.
5 | You speak only in raspy whispers.
6 | You have a handprint burned into your shoulder.

        <name>Oath of Unrest: Horrifying Grasp</name>
        <text>You can use an action to touch a creature within 5 feet of you and expend points from your Lay on Hands healing pool. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to your paladin spell save DC.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.

You can't use the spell to maintain control of a creature when you cast it in this way, only to create new undead servants.

If you die while in this state, your soul can inhabit the body of an undead servant created by this feature. You replace all of the target's statistics with your own and return to life through it with half of your hit points.

Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
