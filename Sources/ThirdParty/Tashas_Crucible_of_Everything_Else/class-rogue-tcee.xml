        <name>Roguish Archetype: Improviser</name>
        <text>Improvisers strive to never be caught off guard and to be able to think of solutions most wouldn't consider. Able to utilise their environment and mundane objects, these genius rogues can fashion complex traps and helpful tools at a moment's notice. Many dabble in arcane magic to further augment their attacks and contraptions and often attempt to outsmart their enemies, preparing tactics far in advance of any conflict.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Improviser: Improvised Trap</name>
        <text>You gain proficiency with tinkers' tools if you don't already have it. You can use your action to make an Intelligence check using your tinkers' tools to create an improvised trap in an unoccupied 5 by 5 ft. space within 5 feet, using the environment and supplies you have gathered. The trap is hidden, but can be spotted on a successful Perception check with a DC equal to your tinkers' tool check result. You may only have one trap active at a time and can only lay another by dismantling and using parts of the first.

The trap lasts for one hour. If a creature enters the space in that time it must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. On a failed save the creature takes 2d6 piercing, slashing, acid or poison damage (your choice when you set the trap) and you can add your Sneak Attack dice, which deal the same damage type as the trap. Alternatively, you can sacrifice your sneak attack damage to instead cause the target to be restrained until the end of its next turn or to be knocked prone.

Beginning at 9th level, the damage of your traps counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Using the materials gathered from your surroundings, you can craft a non magical piece of adventuring gear worth no more than 25 gp. The item lasts for one hour, after which it breaks down into its constituent pieces.

        <name>Improviser: Flash Bomb</name>
        <text>You are able to improvise a powerful explosive that can be thrown to disorient and subdue your enemies.

As an action, you throw the explosive to a point you choose within 30 feet of you. Each creature with 10 feet must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, each creature takes radiant damage equal to your sneak attack dice and is stunned and blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save a creature takes half damage and is not stunned or blinded.

Creatures that are stunned and blinded by this feature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

Stunned:
	• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.
	• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

        <name>Roguish Archetype: Temple Raider</name>
        <text>Places of divine power, both ancient and modern, call to the temple raiders. These rogues exploit glimmers of divine magic to enter magically warded areas and recover treasures, mystical and mundane.

Temple raiders come from a mix of origins, which explain their motivation in delving into places of power and the sources of the divine spark that aids them in their quest. Some are scholars, seeking and exploiting objects of historical religious impower. Others are grifters, seeking artifacts for personal gain and using stolen divine magic to aid their efforts. Still others are sent on their mission by the gods themselves, gifted with divine magic to disrupt places of worship of other faiths, recover lost temples of their own faith, or as a form of worship to gods of trickery and thievery.

        <name>Temple Raider: Spellcasting</name>
        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, when you take this subclass, you gain access to a limited pool of divine magic that aids you in your exploits.

Cantrips:
You learn three cantrips: resistance and two other cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn another cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Temple Raider Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher:
You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice. The Spells Known column of the Temple Raider Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since you gain your spells by divine communion or tapping intuitively into ancient mysteries. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

        <name>Temple Raider: Channel Divinity</name>
        <text>You have learned to channel the power of gods in the same way as their servants, calling on either the deity who sends you on your missions or the gods you have stolen rituals and items of power from.

Beginning at 9th level you can channel divine energies to fuel magical effects. You may use this ability to Invoke Duplicity or Pry into Darkness. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You may use this ability twice and must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your spell save DC.

Invoke Duplicity:
You can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusionary duplicate of yourself.

As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

Pry Into Darkness:
You can use your Channel Divinity to discover and protect yourself from mystical wards.

As an action, you can present a holy symbol. You magically discern the location and nature of all traps within 60 feet, and have advantage on checks made to disable those traps for the next minute.

Starting at 17th level, you may make this call as a bonus action or a reaction. Describe the assistance you seek and which deity or similar power (such as an archfey, demon prince or elder elemental) that you seek it from, then roll 1d4. On a 4, the chosen power intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. Depending on the power chosen and your relationship to it, the power may perform the service willingly or be compelled, in which case it may take offense at your presumption or demand some form of payment for its aid. If the power intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

        <text>The order of the witchblades teaches its members to brew a wide variety of hellbroths, deadly poisons, corrosive acids, and other such concoctions and decoctions. Armed with coated blades and explosive vials of both chemical and alchemical mixtures, they are prepared for any situation. No matter how much wealth a noble accrues, or how big and strong a monster grows, they are nothing compared to the merciless touch of nature and you are its vessel.

These debilitating, mind-numbing effects are produced by secret recipes, which are often only bequeathed from parent to child, or mentor to mentee. This oral tradition usually goes back to a particularly creative, and conveniently amoral alchemist, a back-alley apothecary, a trained physician, or even a disgruntled gardener.

Whichever the case might be, you know your way around both a dagger and a cauldron. In the hands of a witchblade like you, a couple droplets can change the course of history.

        <name>Witchblade: Witchblade Compounds</name>
        <text>Witchblades rely on compounds, natural or otherwise, which have detrimental effects on creatures that are exposed to them. You know three recipes from the Minor Compounds Table below. On your adventures, you might find other recipes from the Minor Compounds table. You can learn a recipe found in this way by spending 8 hours experimenting with it.

Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can brew two vials of minor compounds of your choice from the recipes you know. The compounds remain potent until the end of your next short or long rest.

You can prepare one additional minor compound vial, and learn one additional minor compound recipe when you reach 9th, 13th and 17th levels in this class.

You can administer your compounds in three ways:

	• Whenever you use your Sneak Attack, you can choose to replace the extra damage with the effects of one of your prepared compounds. This does not consume the vial's contents. If the compound has a duration, it lasts until the end of your next turn.

	• As an action, you can toss one of your vials to a surface you can see within 30ft of you. The vial is destroyed, and it spreads a cloud of colorful gas which dissipates almost immediately. Any creature within 10ft of the point of impact is subjected to the compound. If the compound has a duration, it lasts for one minute, and the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	• As a bonus action, you pour the compound into up to 5 gallons of liquid or 5 pounds of food. Any creature which consumes the tainted item is subjected to the compound after 10 minutes. The vial is emptied and cannot be used anymore. If the compound has a duration, it lasts for one hour.

When subjected to a compound, a creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or else suffer its effects. The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

        <text>Caustic Fang:
On a failed save, the creature suffers an amount of acid damage equal to your sneak attack damage, and its movement speed is halved for the duration. On a successful save, it suffers half as much damage but no additional effects.

Croup:
On a failed save, the creature becomes unable to speak, use breath weapons if it has any, or produce the verbal components of spells for the duration.

Feebleness:
On a failed save, for the duration, the creature falls prone and cannot stand up, drops any item it is holding, and lets go of any creature it is grappling.

Frenzy:
The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your sneak attack damage for the 42 duration. On a failed save, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion.

Haplessness:
On a failed save, for the duration, whenever the creature makes an attack roll or ability check, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

Holy Water:
On a failed save, the creature suffers an amount of radiant damage equal to your sneak attack damage. On a successful save, it suffers half as much damage but no additional effects. Either way, if the creature is reduced to zero hit points during the compound's effect, it does not die, and is stabilized. Undead creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw.

Noxious Needle:
On a failed save, the creature suffers an amount of necrotic damage equal to your sneak attack damage, and cannot regain hit points for the duration. On a successful save, it suffers half as much damage but no additional effects.

Toxic Sting:
On a failed save, the creature Suffers an amount of poison damage equal to your sneak attack damage, and is poisoned for the duration. On a successful save, it suffers half as much damage but no additional effects.

Truth Serum:
On a failed save, the creature can't knowingly speak a lie for the duration.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you brew one vial of major compound of your choice from the recipes you know. The compound remains potent until the end of your next long rest.

You learn an additional major compound recipe when you reach 13th, and 17th level in this class, and you can prepare one additional major compound vial when you reach 17th level in this class.

Major compounds can be administered in the same ways as minor ones, but the duration of major compounds is dictated by the recipe used rather than by the way it was administered. Major compounds are more volatile, and using a sneak attack to administer it consumes the entire contents of the vial.

        <text>Aboleth Mucus:
On a failed save, the creature goes berserk for one minute. On each of its turns while berserk, it attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the creature attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Basilisk Blood:
On a failed save, the creature is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Couatl's Bite:
On a failed save, the creature falls unconscious for 1 hour. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it awake.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Draught of Devotion:
On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you for one hour. If you incorporate another creature's hair or fingernail into the compound when brewing it, the creature is charmed by this other creature instead. Whenever it takes damage, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. The charmed creature regards the creature it is charmed by as a friendly acquaintance. When the effect ends, the creature does not know it was charmed (though they may be able to figure it out from context clues).

Hag's Mead:
On a failed save, for one minute, the creature deals only half damage with weapon attacks.

Revenant's Tears:
On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw anytime it ends its turn unable to see you, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Frightened:
	• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

        <name>Roguish Archetype: Wayfinder</name>
        <text>You connect yourself with nature, enhancing your mobility and prowess with primal magic. Often found alongside druids, rangers, and other protectors of the wild, Wayfinders traverse the land to preserve the balance between nature and civilization.

On Ravnica, those who follow this archetype often join the Selesnya Conclave, granting them access to the power of the Worldsoul—a vast collected consciousness of wisdom and experience. In the Forgotten Realms, you might obtain your magic from a deity of nature, such as Melora or Mielikki. On other worlds, your ability to cast spells might come from a connection with a great nature spirit.

Perhaps more than any other rogue, you understand the importance of community and working as one. You are skilled at leading the way and using the terrain to your group's advantage. This is true whether you are guiding allies through an overgrown forest, rubble of a destroyed city block, or people on a crowded street.

        <name>Wayfinder: Spellcasting</name>
        <text>You learn to tap into the power of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 of the Basic Rules or the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spell- casting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.

Cantrips:
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots:
The Wayfinder Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of them, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell entangle and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast entangle using either slot.

Preparing Spells:
You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your rogue level divided by 3, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:
at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

Spellcasting Ability:
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
