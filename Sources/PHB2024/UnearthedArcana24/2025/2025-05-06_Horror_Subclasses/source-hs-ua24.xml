  <description>Scream!... for joy with this new Unearthed Arcana document in which we explore horror themed subclasses using the rules from the 2024 Player's Handbook. This playtest document presents revised subclasses for the Bard (College of Spirits), Cleric (Grave Domain), Rogue (Phantom), Sorcerer (Shadow Sorcery), and Warlock (Hexblade Patron and Undead Patron) as well as new subclasses for the Artificer (Reanimator) and Ranger (Hollow Warden).

This Is Playtest Content
The material in Unearthed Arcana is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. The options here are experemental and in draft form, usable in your D&amp;D campaign but not refined by final game development. They are not officially part of the game. For these reasons, material in this column is not legal in D&amp;D Adventurers League events. Your feedback will help determine whether we adopt it as official.</description>
