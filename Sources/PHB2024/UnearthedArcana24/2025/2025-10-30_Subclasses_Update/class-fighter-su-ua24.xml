        <name>Fighter Subclass: Cavalier (UA)</name>
        <text>Defend Your Allies on Foot or from a Mount

Cavaliers excel at mounted combat and guard those in their charge, often protecting their superiors and the weak. A Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartees at a state dinner.

        <name>Level 3: Born to the Saddle (Cavalier (UA))</name>
        <text>You have Advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you don't have the Incapacitated condition.
	In addition, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement rather than half your Speed.

        <name>Level 3: Unwavering Mark (Cavalier (UA))</name>
        <text>You can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a Melee weapon, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, you die, or someone else marks the creature.
	While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has Disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you.
	In addition, if a creature marked by you hits a creature other than you with an attack roll, you have Advantage on attack rolls against the marked creature until the end of your next turn.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Level 7: Warding Maneuver (Cavalier (UA))</name>
        <text>You learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can roll 1d8 as a Reaction if you're wielding a Melee weapon or a Shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against the triggering attack. If the attack still hits, the target has Resistance against the attack's damage.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

        <name>Level 15: Ferocious Charger (Cavalier (UA))</name>
        <text>During the first round of each combat, you and your mount's Speed increases by 10 feet, and your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks for that round. When you move within 5 feet of a creature this round, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone condition. A creature makes this save only once during a turn.

        <text>In combat, you get a special Reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn except your turn. You can take this Reaction only to make an Opportunity Attack, and you can't take it on the same turn that you take your normal Reaction.
