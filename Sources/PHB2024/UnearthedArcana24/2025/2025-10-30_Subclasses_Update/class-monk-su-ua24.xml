        <text>Drink Mystic Brews to Overwhelm and Confound Foes

Warriors of Intoxication move with the jerky, unpredictable movements typical of someone who is intoxicated. These Monks sway on unsteady feet to appear incompetent and then prove themselves frustrating to engage. Their apparently erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats.
	Warriors of Intoxication often enjoy playing the fool to bring gladness to the downtrodden or to teach humility to the arrogant, but these Monks are maddening, masterful foes in battle.

Leap to Your Feet. When you have the Prone condition, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your Speed.

Redirect Attack. When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 Focus Point as a Reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of yourself.

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Level 6: Mystic Brew (Warrior of Intoxication (UA))</name>
        <text>Whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest while holding Brewer's Supplies, you can use that tool to magically produce one magical beverage, chosen from the following options: Cinnamon Dragon, Heavenly Spirit, or Refreshing Dip. The beverage appears in a bottle or cask, and the bottle vanishes when the beverage is drunk or poured out. If any beverage remains when you finish a Short or Long Rest, the beverage and its container vanish.

Drinking a Magical Beverage. Only you can gain the benefit of drinking the beverage. You must drink at least a pint of the beverage before gaining its benefit. You can spend 1 minute drinking a pint of the beverage. You then gain the benefits of the beverage for 1 hour, as described below.

	• Cinnamon Dragon. You can take a Magic action to exhale toxic flames in a 30-foot Cone. Each creature makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes Fire damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die and has the Poisoned condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

	• Heavenly Spirit. You gain Resistance to Psychic and Radiant damage.

	• Refreshing Dip. Whenever you regain Hit Points, you regain additional Hit Points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die.

Enhancing a Magical Beverage. When you create a magical beverage, you can expend 1 Focus Point. When you do so, the benefit's duration extends to 8 hours.

	• Drunkard's Luck. You gain Heroic Inspiration if you don't already have it. In addition, you can give yourself Heroic Inspiration when you roll Initiative without it.
