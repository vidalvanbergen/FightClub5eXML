  <description>Familiar faces emerge with this latest Unearthed Arcana! This collection revisits five iconic subclasses, each updated with fresh design and new flexibility for use with the latest Player's Handbook. Inside, you'll find the Barbarian (Path of the Ancestral Guardian and Path of the Storm Herald), the Fighter (Cavalier), the Monk (Warrior of Intoxication), and the Paladin (Oathbreaker).

This Is Playtest Content
The material in Unearthed Arcana is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. The options here are experemental and in draft form, usable in your D&amp;D campaign but not refined by final game development. They are not officially part of the game. For these reasons, material in this column is not legal in D&amp;D Adventurers League events. Your feedback will help determine whether we adopt it as official.</description>
