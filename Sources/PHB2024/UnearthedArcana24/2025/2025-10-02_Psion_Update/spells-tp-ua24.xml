Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 12d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Constructs automatically succeed at the save, and Plant creatures automatically fail the save.
	Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.

    <text>You create an inky void in a 10-foot-radius Sphere at a point you can see above yourself within range.
	When you cast the spell, magical Darkness pours from the sphere, filling a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-tall Cylinder originating from the Sphere until the start of your next turn. The Cylinder is Difficult Terrain, and no light—magical or otherwise-can illuminate the area. When the Darkness appears, each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 Cold damage and have the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
	Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to move the Sphere up to 20 feet horizontally and cause the Sphere to pour magical Darkness until the start of your next turn.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot: The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.

While cloaked, you can move through occupied spaces as if they were Difficult Terrain, and moving doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks. If you end your turn in such a space, you are returned to the last unoccupied space you were in.
	While cloaked, whenever you enter the space of a creature, the creature becomes covered in ectoplasm until the end of your next turn. A creature covered in ectoplasm has its Speed reduced by 10 feet and takes 2d8 Necrotic damage at the start of its turn. A creature can be covered in ectoplasm only once during a turn.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot: While cloaked, your Speed increases by 10 feet for each spell slot level above 2.

	• The target regards all creatures it can see as enemies.

	• Whenever the target chooses a creature other than itself for an attack, spell, or other ability, it must choose at random from among the creatures it can see within range of that attack, spell, or other ability.

	• The target must make an Opportunity Attack each time it is able to.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes another Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends.

On a successful save, the target takes half damage only and the spell ends.
	While Charmed, the target has the Restrained condition and perceives the area around its space as dangerous to it in some way you create. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see or hear anything beyond it. If the target is moved from the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 5d10 Psychic damage and the spell ends.

    <text>You call forth the spirit of a psionic entity. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the Psionic Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Crystal Entity, Ectoplasmic Entity, or Ghostly Entity. The creature resembles an astral entity of that kind, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.
	The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot: Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

Ghostly Form: You have Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and you have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition.

Incorporeal Movement: You have a Fly Speed of 60 feet and can hover. You can move through occupied spaces as if they were Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn in such a space, you take 1d10 Force damage. If the spell ends in such a space, you are returned to the last unoccupied space you were in.

Psionic Recharge: As a Magic action, you can touch a creature (which can be yourself) and roll 1d6. The creature regains one expended spell slot, the level of which equals half the number rolled (round up) or lower. Once a creature regains a spell slot from this spell, that creature can't do so again until it finishes a Long Rest.
