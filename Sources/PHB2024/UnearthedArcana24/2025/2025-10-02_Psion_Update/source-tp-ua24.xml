  <description>We've tapped into the collective pool of consciousness (the survey results), blasted several thought constructs, and created a new and improved Psion class for you to playtest. This document presents a revised Psion class and revised versions of three of its four subclasses: Metamorph, Psykinetic, and Telepath. The Psi Warper subclass scored exceptionally well and doesn't need to go through another playtest. The material uses the rules in the Player's Handbook.

This Is Playtest Content
The material in Unearthed Arcana is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. The options here are experemental and in draft form, usable in your D&amp;D campaign but not refined by final game development. They are not officially part of the game. For these reasons, material in this column is not legal in D&amp;D Adventurers League events. Your feedback will help determine whether we adopt it as official.</description>
