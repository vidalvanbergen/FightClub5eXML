  <description>This Unearthed Arcana features four new subclasses that share an interest in magic. They combine magic and martial prowess, prey on or protect spellcasters, and commune with eldritch beings that seek to return from death. This document presents four subclasses for the Monk (Warrior of the Mystic Arts), the Paladin (Oath of the Spellguard), the Rogue (Magic Stealer), and the Warlock (Vestige Patron). The material uses the rules in the Player's Handbook.
