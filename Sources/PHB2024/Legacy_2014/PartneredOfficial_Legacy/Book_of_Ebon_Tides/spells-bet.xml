    <text>Type: Weather

Freezing wind, forming a line 120 feet long and 20 feet wide, blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 30 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Creatures that fail the saving throw also take 1d12 cold damage and are knocked prone. If cast during cold weather or in dark or shadowy conditions, the saving throw is made with disadvantage. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every i foot it moves when moving closer to you.
	As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.
	The bitter wind disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, lanterns, and similar flames in the area.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the saving throw is made with disadvantage, and the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>When you cast this spell, you cut your body with the material component, your hit point maximum decreases by 3 and the material component disappears. For the duration, you can use a bonus action to draw a blade made of your own bone, blood, and sinew from your body. The blade is a magical weapon, uses your spell attack bonus when you attack with it, and deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit. You are considered proficient with the blade. As a bonus action, you can slide the blade back into your body to conceal it. When the duration ends, the incision in your body disappears, your hit point maximum is restored, and the material component reappears.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the damage dealt by the blade increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd, and your hit point maximum decreases by an additional amount equal to the level of the slot used.

Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 1-10, you take the form of a humanoid made of pure, searing light. On a roll of 11-20, you take the form of a humanoid made of bone-chilling darkness. In both forms, you have immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and a creature that attacks you has disadvantage on the attack roll. You gain additional benefits while in either form.

In Light Form: You shed bright light in a 6o-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet, you are immune to fire damage, and you have resistance to radiant damage. Once per turn as a bonus action, you can teleport to a space you can see within the light you shed.

In Darkness Form: You are immune to cold damage, and you have resistance to necrotic damage. Once per turn as a bonus action, you can target up to three Large or smaller creatures within 30 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled or pushed (your choice) up to 20 feet straight toward or away from you.

    <text>When standing on a riverbank or on the shore of some other body of water, you summon a ferry spirit and its boat, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The spirit is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It takes you and up to I companion per your level across the river or body of water (no action required by you) or to other locations along the same water. If you don't issue any such commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
	If your concentration is broken, the ferry and its guide don't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the conjured spirit, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled ferryman can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
	The GM has the ferry spirit's statistics (using those for lesser lunar devil, see Chapter 9, or bearded devil).

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the boat can take you and your companions across a planar boundary into the Ethereal Plane and then exit on another body of water (and using a barbed devil). When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, it can traverse the River Styx between planes, taking you and your companions to distant parts of the multiverse (and using a lunar devil, see Tome of Beasts, or bone devil).

Roll initiative for the giant, which has their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you) as long as the commands don't violate their alignment. If you don't issue any commands to the giant, they defend themself from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.

This is called a shadow road, and it is subject to normal wear, to destruction by those with the tools to break it, and to magical destruction by hostile forces, such as by dispel magic.
	If you wish, the spell may include a prayer or offering that serves as a keyword. This secret of the road allows anyone who knows and uses it to add one or two effects to the road, such as faster travel on the road (up to double the overland speed usually permitted) or locking and unlocking the road's portals outside of the Shadow Realm. Those who do not know the prayer, ritual, or offering cannot enter the road from outside of the Shadow Realm.

    <text>You sever the bonds of friendship and affection between your targets. Target two creatures of your choice within range that can hear and see you. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target must use its movement and action to move toward and attack the other target of the spell. If an unaffected target of the spell moves out of range, the other target must make every effort to find and attack it. At the end of each turn that one of the targets cannot see the other target, it can make a new saving throw, overcoming the compulsion on a successful save.
	Once all the spell's targets make successful saving throws, you become stunned until the end of your next turn.

At Higher Levels: If you cast this spell using a 9th level slot, you can target two additional creatures. Each of the targets can decide on its turn which of the other targets it attacks or otherwise works against for the moment.

    <text>You turn luck against a creature of your choice within range. When the target makes an ability check, they must first make a Charisma saving throw or the check fails. This spell persists once cast, even if the target moves out of range. If cast with a higher-level slot, each subsequent effect is added to the effect noted above.
	If the target ultimately succeeds on the check (or saving throw or attack At Higher Levels), then you take 1 psychic damage. If you ever lose concentration on the spell, you take 1d4 psychic damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, when the target is required to make a saving throw, it must make a Charisma saving throw in place of the required one, unless the required one is more difficult to make. When you cast this spell with a 4th-level slot, when the target makes an attack roll, it must make a Charisma saving throw prior to making the attack. On a failed save, the attack fails. If you cast this spell with an 8th-level slot, this spell persists for the duration without requiring concentration.

    <text>You and three creatures of your choice within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw when the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is in effect. A creature whose saving throw fails is restrained. If one of the three targeted creatures fails this saving throw, as many as two other creatures (per initial target), each within 30 feet of the initial target, must make the same save. A restrained creature must continue to make saving throws each turn, and their condition worsens on a failure, as follows:

Number of Turns Affected | Condition
1 (spell is cast) | Restrained
2 | Incapacitated
3 | Stunned
4 | Paralyzed
5 | Petrified (turned to stone)

Each condition afflicted adds to the previous conditions. New saving throws reduce the severity of the condition affecting a target by one step on a success. If a target other than you succeeds on the saving throw while it is restrained, the spell ends for it. (You must make a saving throw each round.)
	As with all concentration spells, you can end the spell at any time (no action required). If you are turned to stone, the spell ends after all affected creatures make their saving throws. Creatures recover immediately when the spell ends, except for creatures turned to stone, which remain that way until the effect is removed.
	Creatures turned to stone can see, hear, and smell normally, but they don't need to eat or breathe. If shatter is cast on a stone creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or be killed.
	Creatures transformed into stone can be restored with dispel magic, greater restoration, or comparable magic.

At the time the spell is cast and again at the start of each of your turns, your target must make a Constitution saving throw, decreasing 1d4 + 1 years in age on a successful save or 1 year on a failed one. A target ceases the de-aging process once it is reduced to infancy. A creature that is reduced in age retains all of its memories, ability scores, and features, but it gains I level of exhaustion for each 5 years it is reduced in age. A Medium creature reduced to childhood cannot use weapons with the heavy property. A Medium creature reduced to infancy cannot wield weapons or use tools. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reverts to its true age. Otherwise, the targets is permanently reduced to its new age. Remove curse and greater restoration can be used to return a creature to its true age.
	If you ever unintentionally lose concentration on the spell, you gain levels in exhaustion equal to what the target gained from this spell.

    <text>You generate a wave of shadow matter at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, black winds and currents of shadow matter whip in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point, modifying terrain and sometimes drowning creatures in the area. The area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature touching the ground must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains a level of exhaustion. When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
	The ebon tide deals 30 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it sinks into the earth, consumed by the Shadow Realm. Any creature within a structure when it sinks must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d12 necrotic damage, is knocked prone, and is blinded for 1 round. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become blinded.
	This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM. No more than two of the following effects can be the result of one casting of ebon tide.

Hills and Hollows: Ground rises or sinks throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. These changes take the form of a hill, a slip fault (a new cliff), or a hollow. A total of 1d4 such hills, slip faults, or hollows open in locations chosen by the GM. A hollow or slip fault that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see above). A hollow or hill can alter the flow of local water, such as a moat, stream, or lake.

Rivers, Shores, and Waters. Water in the area can adopt an old course (such as an oxbow) or be swept into a new one, starting at the start of your next turn after you cast this spell. Only one such water element can be altered by the casting of this spell. (You cannot alter both a lake and a stream feeding it, for instance.)

Shadow Mire. All ground in the area of the spell becomes shadow mire (see Chapter 5) for the duration.

Spells known by one member of the coven are known by all members of the coven for the duration and can be cast using any of the shared spell slots.

Friendship: Each of the participants in the toast becomes fey for the duration, in place of their original type, and their status increases by 2d6 while they are in the Shadow Realm or the Bright Lands.

Husbandry: For the duration, each of the participants can communicate with beasts as though they shared a language (though they gain no magical ability to influence them).

Nightmares: For the duration, the first time a creature comes within 30 feet of one of the participants, they must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of all the participants for 1 minute.

Playfulness: Each participant grows gossamer wings, and for 10 rounds within the duration, they gain a fly speed equal to their walking speed. A participant that is not standing on a horizontal surface at the end of their turn falls to the ground.

Restfulness: Each of the participants gains advantage on saving throws against being charmed and can't be put to sleep by a spell or other magical effect for the duration.

    <text>A creature of your choice within range is overcome with a need to consume the flesh of its own kind. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, its teeth become needlelike, and it becomes able to pinpoint creatures of the same type as it within 150 feet by scent. On its turn, the creature must move toward the nearest creature of its type by the fastest means possible. If it is within 5 feet of a creature of its type it must use its bonus action to make a bite attack against it. Your target has proficiency with its bite attack and deals damage equal to 1d6 + its Strength modifier. If a creature of its type is not present within 150 feet of the target, it must attack the closest living creature to it.
	At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, the target can make a new saving throw. The target has advantage on its saving throw if it is triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends, and the target is poisoned for 1 hour, unless it is a cannibal or comes from a cannibalistic culture.

On a failed save, a target becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

Clumsiness: Your target's speed is halved for I minute, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity ability checks and saving throws. At the end of each of its turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.

Fatiguing: Your target must make a Constitution saving throw, gaining 1d4 levels of exhaustion on a failed save or 1 level of exhaustion on a successful one.

Vampiric: You recover a number of hit points equal to half the damage you dealt. If you dealt damage to multiple creatures, you recover half the amount of damage you dealt to one of the targets.

Weakness: The target deals the minimum possible damage on melee attacks, if it hits, for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.

Withering: You deal an extra 4 dice of damage of the same type as the damage dice of the spell and all damage dealt by your spell becomes necrotic damage.

A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already blinded takes 1d8 piercing damage.
	A creature blinded by grim shadows can use its action to make a Dexterity or Wisdom saving throw (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, its sight returns.

This spell instantly summons a glittering moonbeam that transports one sleeping creature or object of your choice that you can see within range to a destination you select. If you target an unwilling creature, it gains a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell fails, and the caster appears in the target location instead. A transferred creature wakes up as soon as it arrives at its destination. If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether the creature or object arrives there successfully.
	The GM rolls d20 and consults the Lunar Transfer table below. The following definitions will help:

	• Grove or Magic Circle means a hallowed druid grove or a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.

	• Memento means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.

	• Very Familiar is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.

	• Seen Casually is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar.

	• Viewed Once is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic.

	• Description is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.

	• False Destination is a place that doesn't exist.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or perhaps you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.

On Target: The target creature or object appears where you want it to.

Off Target: The target creature or object appears a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 5 miles times a 1d20 roll, though never more than half the distance traveled. For example, if you sent someone 250 miles and they landed off target, and you rolled an 8 on the d20, then they would arrive off target by 40 miles. If you had sent them only 20 miles, they could not be more than Io miles off target. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting someone to a coastal city and they wound up 20 miles out at sea, they could be in trouble.

Similar: Your target creature or object winds up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are sending someone to your home laboratory, for example, they might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, the creature or object appears in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, they could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.

Mishap. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. The teleporting creature or object takes 2d12 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up. (Multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time.)

You exhort a fiend to attack a distant foe. After the offering is made, make a spell attack roll to determine which fiend is summoned:

Summoning Table
d20 | Result | CR
1-4 | Sending fails | —
5-8 | Wind demon (see Creature Codex) or quasit | 1-2
9-12 | Rattok demon (see Creature Codex) or bearded devil | 3-4
13-16 | Lesser lunar devil (see Chapter 9) or vrock | 4-6
17-20 | Lunar devil (see Tome of Beasts) or hezrou | 8
21+ | Alnaar (see Creature Codex) or horned devil | 9-11

Once summoned, you must compel the fiend to seek out a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you by making a DC Io Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, the fiend slinks off to its target, usually but not always by night. On a failure, the fiend refuses, and the offering and the bowl are consumed in the casting.
	The conjured fiend may find that the target is warded or inaccessible or simply difficult to find (whether because of invisibility or some other reason).
	In this case, you must make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, the fiend returns and demands no further offering, reports its failure, and vanishes. On a failure, the fiend returns and demands another offering. If this is not immediately forthcoming, it attacks you.

You create a shimmering, multicolored bubble around a Large or smaller creature or an object within range. The bubble is a 5-foot-radius sphere that has to hit points and an AC equal to your spell save DC. The bubble rises 10 feet into the air along with its contents, up to 30 feet, at the beginning of each of your turns. A creature trapped inside the bubble at the beginning of its turn cannot see or hear anything outside the bubble and must make a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you and the bubble until the start of its next turn. A creature outside the bubble that targets it with an attack must make a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you and the bubble until the beginning of its next turn.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can create one additional bubble for each slot level above 4th.

    <text>Type: Liminal

You conjure a portal or doorway that links an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location in the mortal or fey realms—such as Midgard, the Shadow Realm, or the Summer Lands—that you have stood. The portal is a semicircular opening, which you can make s to 20 feet in diameter—it is often cast under a bridge, archway, or even under roots or branches of a large tree. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. It has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal. The portal lasts for the duration.
	Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

At Higher Levels. If cast using a 5th level or higher spell slot, you may make the portal last for 1 week after you create it. If cast using a 6th-level or higher spell slot, the shadow doorway is permanent until dispelled with a radiant beacon (see below) or wish spell.

    <text>You cause a small bit of bad luck to befall a creature, making it look humorously foolish. You create one of the following effects:

	• A small, oily puddle appears under the feet of your target, causing it to lose balance. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be unable to use bonus actions on its next turn as it regains its footing.

	• Tiny particles blow in your target's face, causing it to sneeze. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on its first attack roll on its next turn.

	• Strobing lights flash briefly before your target's eyes, causing difficulties with its vision. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or its passive Perception is halved until the end of its next turn.

	• The target feels the sensation of a quick, mild clap against its ears, briefly disorienting it. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain its concentration.

	• An invisible force sharply tugs on the target's trousers, causing their clothing to slip. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll with a two-handed weapon or loses its shield bonus to its AC until the end of its next turn as it uses one hand to gather itself.

Only one of these effects can be used on a single creature at a time.

A pillar of light falls from the air, filling the square you are in and the area within 5 feet of you. Each other creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
	For the duration, a pillar of brilliant radiance shines around you and moves with you. It sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light is sunlight.
	This spell's light can be seen from a distance of up to 10 miles outdoors at night or 5 miles during twilight.

    <text>Type: Liminal, Shadow

You create a door in the nearest wall, cliff, tree, or similar structure. It is immediately bound to a similar door up to 200 feet away. The near door must be a place within 10 feet that you can see while the distant door can be one that you can visualize or that you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as 100 feet straight down or 50 feet to the northwest and upward at a 45-degree angle.
	Once the door is conjured, you can take actions normally to open and pass through the near portal, which immediately teleports you to the distant portal. Other creatures may do the same while the spell remains. The spell ends after the duration or when someone closes the distant portal's door as a bonus action.

At Higher Levels: If cast at 5th level, this spell can open the door to a shadow road. This may require additional somatic or material components specific to that road, and lacking those, the spell fails and is wasted.

    <text>Type: Shadow

You sing a piping tune and conjure shadows into enormous, ever-growing webs. The area within a 20-foot cube within range is filled with shadows, and the area is lightly obscured and provides half cover to any creature within. You may create a new cube of shadows in range every other round so long as you retain concentration, in which case the previous cube disappears 1 round later. Cubes can overlap but there is no cumulative effect from it.
	Each creature that enters the area or starts its turn in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated for as long as it remains in the shadows or until it breaks free. A creature incapacitated by the shadows can make a Strength check each round against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer incapacitated.
	The shadows can be removed from a single 20-foot cube with a daylight spell.

Crackling with lightning, you teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of both the space you left and your new space must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d12 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
	On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your bonus action to call up the lightning and open such a storm door again, targeting a different space with the door each time. If you are outdoors when you cast this spell, a storm develops within 1 minute and follows you. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases to 2d12, and you can teleport up to 240 feet.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, a creature of your choice within 5 feet of you can teleport through the storm door with you. Accompanying creatures do not suffer the lightning damage.
