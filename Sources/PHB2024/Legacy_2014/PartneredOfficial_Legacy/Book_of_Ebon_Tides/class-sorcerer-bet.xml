      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Sorcerer Subclass: Light Weaver (Third Party) (Legacy)</name>
        <text>Your powers are drawn from the spark of light kindled within you. In places of great darkness, there are always those born with the affinity for light, and every shadow must have a shining source. The magic within you represents cosmic balance, and like the light, your magic flickers from radiance to darkness moment to moment.

        <name>Level 3: Trick Of The Light (Light Weaver (Third Party) (Legacy))</name>

        <name>Level 3: Flickering Aura (Light Weaver (Third Party) (Legacy))</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can choose whether your magic is light-shifted or dark-shifted. You can change your choice at the end of a long rest.
	While light-shifted you can use an action to emit an aura of bright light in a 15-footradius sphere centered on yourself. While the aura persists, you can use a bonus action to expand or reduce its radius of bright light by 5 feet, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet.
	While dark-shifted you gain the same ability, but you project an aura of nonmagical darkness.

        <name>Level 6: Refraction Shield (Light Weaver (Third Party) (Legacy))</name>
        <text>At 6th level, you can manipulate the light around you for protection. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically create a shield of light.
	While the shield is in place, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield flashes with searing energy, and the attacker takes 2d8 radiant damage if you are light-shifted or 2d8 necrotic damage if you are dark-shifted. The shield disappears if you fall unconscious or after 10 minutes.

        <text>Starting at 14th level, your manipulation of the light around you becomes masterful. While light-shifted, your Flickering Aura produces sunlight. While darkshifted, your aura produces magical darkness.
	If any of this aura's area overlaps with an area of light or darkness created by a spell equal to or lower than the level of your highest available spell slot, the spell that created the light or darkness is dispelled.
