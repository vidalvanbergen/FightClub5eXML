    <text>This cloak is made of fine ermine and often embellished with fasteners or trimmed with gold or embroidered orange candles, suns, or similar symbols. While wearing this cloak, you can grip its edges and generate a sunbeam spell once per day. If you release the cloak's edges from your grasp, the light fades, and you cannot generate further lines of radiance.
	In addition, while wearing the cloak, you can use your action to generate a set of 10 magical lights once per day, each as bright as a lantern and shedding full sunlight in a 20-foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move any or all the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 30 feet of another light created by this cloak, and a light winks out if travels more than 100 feet from you.

While wearing these boots, you can walk over any body of water as if it were normal terrain, and you can slide or skate over relatively calm waters, snow, ice, sand, magma, or other smooth surfaces at double your normal walking speed. If the snow or ice is on a hill, you move at triple your normal walking speed. You can still use the Dash action normally as well.
	When combined with the armor of the Black River, the Styx boots permit you to use any branch of the River Styx and other planar waterways as a form of shadow road. Once per week, you can walk on such a planar waterway for 8 hours and arrive at any other plane of your choosing.

    <text>This cloak is made of black, brown, and white bat pelts sewn together. While wearing it, you have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you transform into a creature of pure shadow. While in shadow form, your AC increases by 2, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can move through a space as narrow as I inch wide without squeezing. You can cast spells normally while in shadow form, but you can't make ranged or melee attacks with nonmagical weapons. In addition, you can't pick up objects, and you can't give objects you are wearing or carrying to others.
	This effect lasts up to 1 hour. Deduct time spent in shadow form in increments of 1 minute from the total time. After it has been used for 1 hour, the cloak can't be used in this way again until the next dusk when its time limit resets. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

    <text>This seed must be used outdoors, and when thrown, you gain control of the weather within a 5-mile radius for up to 1d8 hours. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind, shifting the weather within 30 minutes, for instance, from a clear day to a cloudy and rainy one, from warm to arctic cold, and from moderate winds to a storm. The effects of a rain and thunder seed must always make the weather less pleasant than they were before: colder, rainier, and windier, never the reverse. While the seed often produces thunder, any lightning does not strike near you, but neither is the lightning under your control.
	The effects of a rain and thunder seed can be countered or dispelled by either a control weather or counterspell spell.

    <text>A tavern seed must be used outdoors, and when thrown, it creates a small, snug tavern of stone and wood, roughly 40 feet by 20 feet, with a lower public floor and an upper floor devoted to the staff bedchambers, storage, and a single room for rent. The entire building takes on an outward style of architecture, materials, roofing, and appearance as suits the region where it stands. It has a staff of three: a cook, a bartender, and a servant, of a type typical of the region (so humans in a human realm, shadow fey in the Shadow Realm, goblins in the wastelands, and so on).
	Using a tavern seed in an existing settlement creates a snug tavern as normal, magically shifting two buildings to either side slightly to make room. The new structure is certainly notable and surprising to residents of the place.
	A tavern seed combined with a road seed always includes a set of warm, secure stables as well as the tavern building itself.

    <detail>very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)</detail>
    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This strange twilight-hued tome was written on pages of pure shadow weave, bound in traditional birchboard covers, wrapped with shadow goblin hide, and imbued with the memories of forests in the Shadow Realm. Its covers often dance with shadows as if it were resting in a forest grove, and some owners swear that a goblin face appears on them now and again. The sturdy lock on one side opens only for wizards, elves, and shadow fey (see Tome of Beasts).
	The book has 15 charges, and it regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily in the twilight before dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the book retains its Ebon Tides and Shadow Lore properties but loses its Spells property.

Ebon Tides. If you spend 100 hours over a period of 30 days or more studying the volume, you can perform a magical ritual to shift the structure of the Shadow Realm in particular ways. At any point after your study completes, you can expend 5 of the book's charges while spending 1 minute concentrating and performing invocations to transform the terrain near you. You don't need to repeat the study to use this property again. When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the table below for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected. Built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an overshadow (see Tome of Beasts 2) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options.
	Deities, fey lords and ladies (see Tome of Beasts), archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Shadow Realm can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains.

Shadow Lore. If you spend 1o minutes referencing this book while researching the Shadow Realm or its creatures, you double your proficiency bonus on Arcana, History, and Religion checks to recall lore about such subjects for the next 24 hours. If you don't have proficiency in these skills, you instead gain proficiency in them for the next 24 hours, but you are only proficient when recalling information about the subjects of your research. This research can be done during a short rest.

Spells. While holding the book, you can use an action to expend I or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: cloak of shadow* (1 charge), darkness (2 charges), mirror image (2 charges), phantasmal killer (4 charges), see invisibility (2 charges), seeming (5 charges), shadow gateway* (5 charges), shadow step* (4 charges), or slither* (2 charges). You can also use an action to cast the douse light* or minor illusion cantrips from the book without using any charges. (Spells marked with an asterisk are from Deep Magic.)

Retributive Shadows. You can use an action to speak a special command word and rip the book in half. The book is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in a wave of shadow magic. Four 10-foot cubes of shadow move outward from the book in the cardinal directions, and each cube moves up to 20 feet each round, away from the point where the book was destroyed. This effect works like the creeping darkness (see Deep Magic) spell, except it creates four cubes instead of three, and the necrotic damage dealt by the spell increases by 1d6 for each charge remaining in the book. At the GM's discretion, this effect can work like the incendiary cloud spell instead of the creeping darkness spell, except the cloud is a cloud of shadow that deals necrotic damage instead of fire damage, is centered on you, and the damage dealt by the spell increases by 1d4 for each charge remaining in the book.

Book of Ebon Tides:
DC | Effect
8 | Obscure a path and remove all signs of passage (30 feet per point over 7).
10 | Create a grove of trees (30 feet across per point over 9).
11 | Create or dry up a lake or pond (I foot wide per point over 11).
12 | Create a flowing stream (1 foot wide per point over 11).
13 | Overgrow an existing road with brush or trees (300 feet per point over 12).

15 | Move a forest (300 feet per point over 14).
16 | Create a small hill, riverbank, or cliff (1o feet tall per point over 15).
17 | Turn a small forest into grassland or clearing or vice versa (30 feet across per point over 16).
18 | Create a new river (Io feet wide per point over 17).
19 | Turn a large forest into grassland or vice versa (300 feet across per point over 19).
20 | Create a new mountain (1,000 feet high per point over 19).
22 | Shrink an existing hill or mountain (reducing 1,000 feet per point over 21).

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This small statuette of a snow-topped, forested mountain seems remarkably detailed, yet it stands only about 4 inches tall. Stories tell that it was a gift from the bearfolk to the shadow fey priests of Hecate when they first came to the Shadow Realm and that it was once merely a collapsible hill. Over time, its power has grown as it travels from one owner to another. The priests of Hecate say no one can retain it for more than a year.
	When you hold the collapsible mountain, you may take an action to speak its command word to instantaneously create a pine-covered mountain, fully 2,500 feet tall. You may choose to either have the mountain rise under you or to have the mountain rise under another creature you can see at least 120 feet away. In the first case, other creatures nearby may wind up hundreds of feet below you (and combat ends between any two non-adjacent creatures). Groups of creatures move roughly 2d6 × 100 feet apart. If you have the mountain rise under another creature, you and adjacent creatures see the mountain grow rapidly nearby, but you remain at the altitude you started at. A small spring or brook usually appears nearby in this instance.
	Each day, the mountain's land and streams provide simple food and fresh, cold water sufficient to nourish Is humanoids or five steeds.
	Speaking the command word again collapses the mountain. Any creature standing on it is not harmed (the descent is swift but not dangerous). Creatures who enter combat unaware of the nature of the collapsible mountain are treated as if surprised by the sudden change.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This dazzling helm is set with 1d12 sapphires, 2d12 black opals, and 3d12 obsidians. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.
	You gain the following benefits while wearing it:

	• You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: darkness (obsidian), vampiric touch (black opal), or wall of ice (sapphire). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

	• As long as it has at least one sapphire, you have blindsight to 120 feet. Any living creature that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 necrotic damage.

	• As long as the helm has at least one black opal, you have resistance to necrotic damage.

	• As long as the helm has at least one piece of obsidian, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to sizzle with black flames. The flames are harmless to you and to the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.

Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take necrotic damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits shadowy purple rays from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking necrotic damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.

    <text>(Requires Attunement by a Cleric or Wizard) Hecate's lantern is said to have been used to divide darkness and light during the creation of the Shadow Realm. It is made of gold and mithral with panes of amber and clear crystal, and it can be held by an ornate loop at its top. A single ever-burning candle shines within, though the panes of the lantern often make it appear as three candles.
	You must be brandishing the lantern to use it. This lantern has 12 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d12 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the lantern's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the lantern vanishes and returns to a high priestess of Hecate or to the goddess herself.

Create Mire. As an action, you can expend 5 charges to create shadow mire (see Chapter 5) with a 40-foot radius centered on you.

Force Shift. As an action, you can expend 3 charges to force any shapeshifter you can see within 120 feet to shift their form. If unwilling, the target gains a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect.

Spells. As an action, you can cast the moonbeam spell (2 charges) with a range encompassing any point you can see or the child of light and darkness spell (8 charges, see Chapter 4).

When you use it in the Shadow Realm, where fresh water is much more difficult to find, it directs you to bodies of water, but it might also direct you toward homes with freshwater barrels or to creatures with containers of fresh water on them.

    <text>This adamantine dagger has a blue leather hilt wrapped with gold wire, a star opal as its pommel. Its blade is etched with the phases of the moon and a triangle similar to Hecate's holy symbol. It is said to be one of the daggers the goddess used when she parted and shaped raw shadow to create the Shadow Realm for her devoted followers. Several such daggers may exist.
	You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.

Counterspell. When you speak Hecate's name while wielding the dagger, your counterspell rolls are all made with advantage.

Geas. Once per day, you may cast the geas spell on any cleric, paladin, or devout follower of Hecate.

Control Shadows. Once per day, you may cast either the ebon tide spell or the dimension door spell.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

Proficiency: simple, dagger

    <text>Used by the river giants to harvest memory fragments from the dark waters of the Shadow Realm, mooncatcher's nets are woven by the priests of Hecate or by moonshadow catcher goblins.
	You have a +1 bonus on attack rolls with this magic weapon. It has the normal effects of a net but is very tough. A creature must succeed on a DC I6 Strength check to free itself or another creature from the net. Dealing 15 slashing damage to the net also frees the creature. The net has AC 14 and 25 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the net drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
	As well as using the net as a weapon, you can drag the net through dark water to harvest 1d4 random memory fragments. Roll 1d10 on the table below for each fragment to determine the memory fragment captured. Each memory fragment can be used as component in creating a memory philter (see Memory Philters above) of the type listed in parentheses. You must make a successful DC Is Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to transfer each memory fragment from the net into a suitable container or it is lost.

Memory Fragments:
d10 | Memory fragment
1 | Happy time with a friend (philter of boundless joy)
2 | Embarrassing failure (philter of deep despair)
3 | Glorious success (philter of enchanted fortune)
4 | Favored childhood memory (philter of innocence)
5 | Act of kindness (philter of loving kindness)
6 | Romantic partner (philter of lust)
7 | Deceased loved one (philter of mercy)
8 | Great victory in battle (philter of righteous wrath)
9 | A dream (philter of waking dreams)
10 | Roll twice

Special: A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

    <text>You can use a bonus action to speak this magic scimitar's command word, causing golden radiance to spring from the blade. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot-radius sphere and dim light for an additional 30 feet. While the scimitar is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to any target it hits. The witchlight glow lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the scimitar.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
