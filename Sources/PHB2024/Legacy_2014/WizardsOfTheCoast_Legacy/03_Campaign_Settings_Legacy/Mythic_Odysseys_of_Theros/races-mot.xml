      <name>Description</name>
      <text>The leonin guard the shining lands of Oreskos, a golden plain where even the gods rarely trespass. Prides of these nomadic, lion-like humanoids rarely interact with other peoples, having all they need in their shimmering homeland and knowing the treachery of strangers. Still, some leonin wonder what lies beyond Oreskos's border mountains and seek to test themselves in a wider world.

      <text>Leonin are typically over 6 feet tall, with some standing over 7 feet. Your size is Medium.

Here's how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:

Size modifier = 2d10

Height= 5 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches

Weight in pounds = 180 + (2d6 × your size modifier)</text>
