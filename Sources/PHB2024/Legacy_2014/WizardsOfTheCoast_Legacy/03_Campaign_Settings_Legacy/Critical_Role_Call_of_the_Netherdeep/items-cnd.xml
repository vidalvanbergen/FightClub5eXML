<text>The jewel of Three Prayers is a Vestige of Divergence (see the "Vestiges of Divergence" sidebar). In ancient times, Alyxian the Apotheon bore this amulet as a symbol of his covenant with three Prime Deities: Sehanine the Moon Weaver, Avandra the Change Bringer, and Corellon the Arch Heart. When the jewel is found, only Sehanine's power thrums within its dormant heart. The power of the other two deities waits to be reawakened by a hero— or heroes— who can follow in Alyxian's footsteps.

Dormant State:

In this state, the jewel of Three Prayers is a glittering golden disk attached to a fine golden chain. The chain magically resizes to function as a necklace for the creature that wears it.

In its Dormant State, the jewel has the following properties:

• You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing the jewel.
• While wearing or holding the jewel, you can use an action to cause it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until you extinguish it (no action required).
• The jewel has 3 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the jewel, you can expend 1 charge from it to cast the invisibility spell.

Awakened State:

In this state, the jewel has received the blessing of Avandra the Change Bringer. Three delicate spires unfurl from the jewel's center, like the buds of flowers opening in the spring. Three lapis lazuli stones rest like dewdrops on these spires.

The following benefits of the jewel improve:

• The bonus that the jewel confers to your AC increases to +2.
• Its number of charges increases to 5. The jewel gains the following additional properties, which you can use while wearing or holding it:
• You can expend 1 of the jewel's charges (no action required) to end one of the following conditions on yourself: grappled, paralyzed, or restrained.
• When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you fails a saving throw, you can expend 1 of the jewel's charges as a reaction to enable that creature to reroll the saving throw, potentially turning a failure into a success. The creature must use the new roll.

Exalted State:

In this state, the jewel has received the blessing of Corellon the Arch Heart. A gleaming emerald surrounded by a halo of gold appears on the jewel.

The following benefits of the jewel improve:

• The bonus that the jewel confers to your AC increases to +3.
• Its number of charges increases to 7. The jewel gains the following additional properties, which you can use while wearing or holding it:
• You gain the ability to breathe water, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
• Each of your allies within 30 feet of you gains the ability to breathe water and gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed.
• As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the jewel's charges to target yourself or one willing creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. The target teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 15 feet of yourself, along with any equipment the target is wearing or carrying. The target appears in a flash of golden radiance, and each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target's new location must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.

<text>This magic weapon has a dull, rusty color or has veins of ruidium running through it. While this weapon is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

• You can breathe water.
• You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Ruidium Strike: A creature you hit with this weapon takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage.

Ruidium Corruption: When you roll a 1 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

If Ruidium Is Destroyed: If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and a ruidium weapon becomes a +2 weapon.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the Finesse property.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Proficiency: simple, spear

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Special: A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

If Ruidium Is Destroyed: If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and a ruidium weapon becomes a +2 weapon.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Proficiency: simple, sling
