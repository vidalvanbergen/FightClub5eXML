    <!-- Cleric Subclass: Order Domain -->
    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Cleric Subclass: Order Domain</name>
        <text>The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. On Ravnica, the domain is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain. On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include Bane, Tyr, Majere, Erathis, Pholtus, Wee Jas, Aureon, Maglubiyet, Nuada, Athena, Anubis, Forseti, and Asmodeus.
	The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action's results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.

Law establishes hierarchies: Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

Order Deities:
Example Deity | Pantheon
Aureon | Eberron
Bane | Forgotten Realms
Majere | Dragonlance
Pholtus | Greyhawk
Tyr | Forgotten Realms
Wee Jas | Greyhawk

Domain Spells:
You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Order Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature in the Player's Handbook for how domain spells work.

Order Domain Spells:
Cleric Level | Spells
1st | command, heroism
3rd | hold person, zone of truth

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to exert an intimidating presence over others. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can also cause any of the charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

If you deal your Divine Strike damage to a creature on your turn, you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn.

	Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics' blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and the clerics' magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.

        <text>You can forge an empowering bond among people who are at peace with one another. As an action, you choose a number of willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your proficiency bonus. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn.
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.
