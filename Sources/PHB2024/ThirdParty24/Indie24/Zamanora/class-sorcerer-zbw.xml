        <name>Level 3: Veilmark Information (Zamanora)</name>
        <text>It is said that trespassing upon the spirit world leaves a tangible brand on one's body and soul. Mortals should never peer beyond the Veil, lest the spirits take notice and mark them forevermore. Let a marked person into your home and you invite certain calamity. The lands of Zamanora are riddled with such fiction and cautionary tales that only work to paint those who are inquisitive in a bad light. Yet they are right about one thing; someone who interacts with the Hidden World too often is bound to be "marked".

As characters engage in encounters with curses, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena, they accrue Veilmark. This attribute reflects their growing connection to the spirit realm and the transformative effects of these experiences on their physical and spiritual selves. Veilmarked is the term used by the Zamanori to describe individuals who have thus changed, and denotes characters who have accrued enough Veilmark to cross a threshold. If playing in a different setting, you may use the broader term Aura to describe the system.
	The influence of Veilmark on a character is determined by their Veilmark Score. The more a character interacts with curses, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena, delving into the mysteries of the Hidden World, the more their Veilmark Score increases. A character's Veilmark Score is effectively a pool of innate power they may tap into in order to produce certain effects that aid them when interacting with spiritual entities. However, at the same time, the higher one's Veilmark Score is, the more otherworldly they feel when interacting with their peers, making them wary and distrustful of their presence.
	Characters start out with a Veilmark Score of 0, which may increase up to a maximum of 100 throughout a campaign. Certain features, such as the Veilborn Origin (see Chapter II: Origins), or the Veilscarred Barbarian's Dark Bargain and Willow's Embrace (see Chapter II: Subclasses), signify that a character has already been extensively exposed to the Hidden World and influence that character's starting Veilmark Score according to their description.

Gaining Veilmark:
An increase of Veilmark results in noticeable physical changes, signifying the character's deepening connection with the spirit realm. Every time a character's Veilmark modifier increases, roll on the table below or choose one of the physical alterations listed to manifest on them.
	Your Veilmark Score may increase every time you experience an event that severely impacts your psyche by challenging what you priorly thought was real. Interacting with a being you believed to be a mere folktale, falling victim to a vicious curse, or drinking water from a bewitched spring can all increase your Veilmark Score. Such an experience, along with the implications caused upon oneself due to it, is known as a Harrow.
	A Harrow may affect a single or multiple characters at once, and at different levels of Severity (see Harrows table), based on roleplay and the narrative course of the story. For example, when a stranger who asks to share in the warmth of the party's campfire is later revealed to be a malign spirit, every character present may be subjected to a Harrow of Considerable level; yet for a character who recognizes the spirit as that of a deceased relative of theirs, the same Harrow may qualify as Intense. At the same time, another character who has already dabbled in occult practices to a point of communing with the spirits of the dead may treat this as a Harrow of Inconsequential level. The Severity of a Harrow on a character's psyche, as well as which character is subject to the risk of gaining Veilmark due to it and which isn't, is determined by the Storyteller, according to their interpretation of the player characters' backgrounds, stories, personalities, and any circumstantial factors that apply to each occasion.
	When the Storyteller declares a Harrow, each character that is subject to it must choose whether they wish to Resist or Embrace it. This choice represents their disposition towards the supernatural world, and their openness towards its truths and mysteries.

Reisting Veilmark:
A character who chooses to Resist a Harrow makes a Wisdom saving throw against a DC determined by its Severity. On a success, the experience leaves them unaffected, and nothing happens. On a failure, they must roll the corresponding Veilmark Die. Their Veilmark Score becomes increased by an amount equal to the result. A Hero that succeeds on their Action without Consequences resists the Harrow completely, taking no increase to their Veilmark Score. Otherwise, the Hero rolls the corresponding amount of Veilmark dice. A Success with Consequences means that the Hero's Veilmark increases by an amount equal to half of their result. A roll that only results in Consequences means that the Hero's Veilmark score is increased by the total amount rolled. You may also employ special means, such as the Veil Charm item (see Chapter IV: Fabled Relics), in order to better your chances in resisting any unwanted increases in your Veilmark Score.

Embracing Veilmark:
A character who chooses to Embrace a Harrow forgoes making any attempts at resisting its effects and does not roll the corresponding Veilmark Die. That character's Veilmark Score automatically increases by the maximum amount possible.

Veilmark:
d6 | Veilmark Die | DC | Status Tier
1 | 1d6 | 10 | harrowing-1
2 | 2d6 | 15 | harrowing-2
3 | 3d6 | 20 | harrowing-3
4 | 4d6 | 25 | harrowing-4
5 | 5d6 | 30 | harrowing-5

Veilmark Thresholds:
Whenever a Harrow causes your Veilmark Score to increase beyond the thresholds of 25, 50, 75 and 99 for the first time, you gain a Veilmark Transformation. For every Veilmark Transformation that you have, you gain a cumulative -2 penalty to any Influence Actions you take against other non-Veilmarked Humanoids and Beasts, unless you are trying to intimidate them.

Veilmark Thresholds Table:
Threshold | Title
25 | Shadowlit
50 | Equinoctial
75 | Moonstruck
99 | Spiritwalker

Transformations &amp; Powers:
Veilmark transformations are a physical manifestation of the Hidden World's effects on your body. Such a transformation is a consequence of your innate understanding of the supernatural and ability to harness the powers that lie within, but ultimately comes at a cost. The first time you cross each of those Veilmark Thresholds, you gain a Veilmark Transformation and two new Veilmark Abilities from the tables below. For every Veilmark Transformation you have, you gain a cumulative -2 penalty to any Influence Actions you take against other non-Veilmarked Humanoids and Beasts, unless you are trying to intimidate them.

When you gain a new Veilmark Transformation, roll on the table below to determine its nature. If the result is a Transformation you have already undergone, roll again until you get a new one. Once you gain a Veilmark Transformation, it remains with you permanently, even if your Veilmark Score later decreases below that threshold.

Veilmark Transformations Table:
d10 | Transformation
1 | One of your eyes changes color. At night, when the Veil grows thin, you glimpse visions from the other side. This distraction grants you Disadvantage on Initiative rolls during nighttime hours.
2 | A streak of silver appears on your hair. Silvered weapons deal an extra Damage Die to you.
3 | Your skin's complexion becomes a tone paler. Whenever you take Fire damage you take an additional 1d4 Fire damage.
4 | Veins throughout your body become visibly dark beneath your skin. While you are Bloodied and can see an enemy, you can't willingly move away from them.
5 | Your shadow changes to resemble that of a different being. The Attitude of Beasts towards you worsens by one stage.
6 | A strange marking brands your skin like a scar. You have Disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of Curses.
7 | A strange marking brands your skin like a scar. You have Disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of Curses.
8 | A Zagovory symbol appears on your tongue. Whenever you fail an Influence Action, it is treated as attempted Intimidation regardless of your intentions.
9 | You appear sickly and weak. You have Disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of Diseases.
10 | You no longer cast a reflection. You are excluded from beneficial effects caused by spells that target multiple creatures.

Every time you cross a Veilmark threshold, you unlock two new abilities, as detailed in the Veilmark Abilities table. You may use the abilities gained from each threshold a combined total of two times per day. For example, you may use one ability twice, or each ability once. Unlike Transformations, Veilmark Abilities do not last indefinitely. If your Veilmark Score falls below the Threshold that granted you these abilities (see Losing Veilmark), they become dormant and cannot be used until your Veilmark Score rises above the corresponding Threshold again.

Veilmark Threshold Abilities:

Shadowlit:

Detect Spirit. You cast the spell Spirit Sense, without expending a spell slot.

Incorporeal Reach. As a Bonus Action, your attacks harm the very essence of spirits for the next minute. For the duration, once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 Force damage to a target you hit with an attack or spell.

Equinoctial:

Exorcism. As an Action, you touch a creature and end one of the following effects currently afflicting it: Frightened, Charmed, or a Possession.

Pierce the Veil. As part of a successful Study Action made against a creature of the Spirit subtype, you discern either of the following: its Immunities, Resistances or Vulnerabilities.

Moonstruck:

Soul Harvest. As a Reaction to a creature dying within 30 feet of you, you can infuse yourself with a fragment of its departing essence. As a result, you may choose to either regain a number of expended spell slots as a 4th-level Wizard using the Arcane Recovery feature, or gain 25 Temporary Hit Points.

Spiritual Kinship. When you fail a saving throw against a spell or magical effect caused by a creature of the Spirit subtype, you succeed instead.

Spiritwalker:

Ethereal Echo. As an Action, you create an ethereal duplicate of yourself that lasts for 1 minute. This spectral reflection appears in your space and mimics your movements precisely, with an almost imperceptible delay. The echo has half your current Hit Points. When you make an attack that deals damage to a single target, your echo repeats the attack but only deals half damage (rounded down). The echo takes the same damage as you do when you are damaged. It cannot regain Hit Points and vanishes if it reaches 0 Hit Points, you become Incapacitated, or when the duration ends.

Tether Soul. By spending an hour in meditation, you bind your soul to a clearly defined point that you can see in your environment; for example, the hollow of an oak tree, or a statue made of stone. If you die before your next Long Rest, you gain the effects of the Reincarnate spell, but your new species is Haunt (see Chapter II: Species), while your new body forms in the bound point based on the materials it consists of. If you successfully return to life in this way, your Veilmark Score is reduced to 0 and you lose any Veilmark Transformations you have.

Losing Veilmark:
Once you have been exposed to the challenging truths of the Hidden World, it is very difficult, if indeed possible at all, to forget them. However, there are ways to reduce its impact on your being. The diminishing of one's Veilmark represents a retreat from the otherworldly, a return to the mundane, and a fixated anchoring to the Real. Below are the ways you may employ to reduce your Veilmark Score.

Downtime Activity:
You may choose to detach yourself from the supernatural by indulging in mundane activities for extended periods. For every month or Sojourn you spend this way, your Veilmark Score decreases by 5. Examples of such activities include:

	• Engaging with a community in manual labor, such as aiding in the building of a home.

	• Exploring and cultivating deep emotional bonds with others through steady everyday life.

	• Spending time alone to reflect upon yourself, or pursue artistic creations.

Recreation:
Other than spending time in peace and tranquility, you may also pursue more radical methods to reduce your Veilmark Score. These include consuming a God Flesh mushroom (see Chapter IV: Zamanoran Mushrooms), meditating within the Gemstone Caverns, or bathing in the waters of a lake within the Three Nines Forest. While such methods are the swiftest and most potent ways to achieve the intended result, they may carry certain hazards and must be undertaken with caution.

Potent Arcana:
Employing powerful magic, such as an archmage's spell of wishing, or returning to life through use of a Tether Soul (see Veilmark Abilities above) can reduce your Veilmark Score to 0, as well as remove any Veilmark Transformations you have. Once you surpass a Veilmark Threshold and gain a Veilmark Transformation, it remains with you permanently, even if your Veilmark Score later decreases below that threshold. Only Potent Arcana may remove a Veilmark Transformation. These transformations continue to affect both your body and soul, even if you disguise yourself through the means of illusory magic or a shape-changing ability. However, if your score increases again past a threshold you've previously crossed, you won't gain additional transformations for that same threshold. During a campaign in which you want to make the Veilmark system less punishing, you may rule that the effects of Greater Restoration also remove the effects of a Veilmark Transformation from a character. Conversely, reducing your Veilmark below each Threshold means that you lose access to the corresponding Abilities, as detailed above.

Roleplaying Veilmark:
As your Veilmark increases, consider how these changes affect your character's personality and demeanor. Do you welcome them as a mark of growth, or do you view them as aberrations upon your appearance? Consider how your personality might change to reflect them. You might become more aloof, skittish, or stoic. You may pick up a repetitive habit or mannerism. Perhaps the weight of the spirit world will deeply affect your psyche, gradually changing you into an altogether different person.

Social Implications:
In small communities such as the villages of Zamanora, these physical changes can lead to fear, reverence, or superstition. Characters bearing those marks are considered branded by the spirits, influencing their interactions with NPCs.

Fear and Distrust:
In most organized communities, the appearance of a Veilmarked stranger is met with apprehension, the locals fearing the character and associating their marks with bad omens or curses. Otherworldly features in their appearance might put the common folk ill at ease, but beyond that, their mere presence is unsettling for reasons that cannot be interpreted directly, as they carry the stigma of the Hidden World. A character with more than a couple of Veilmark transformations is usually treated as a Spook by common folk who first encounter them. Superstitious folk may be wary of such characters and treat them with extreme caution, to the point of turning them into a pariah amongst their societies or even chasing them away.

Reverence and Respect:
In the dwellings of spirits, or places where their presence is strongly felt, denizens might see the marks as a sign of a blessed or powerful individual, offering assistance or seeking their aid. In such cases, according to the Storyteller's discretion, the penalties to Influence Actions normally associated with Veilmark Transformations may become bonuses instead.

Crimson Focus. While concentrating on Vampiric Touch, you can maintain Concentration on an additional spell that belongs to the schools of either Enchantment or Necromancy. If your Concentration is lost while concentrating on two spells simultaneously, you always lose Concentration on the spell that is not Vampiric Touch first.

Dark Fangs. For the duration of the spell, you can make two, instead of one, melee spell attacks by taking a Magic Action on your turn. The attacks can be against separate creatures.

Siphon Life. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with this spell, you replenish one expended Hit Die.

In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, but it can't pass through water. You have Advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and you are immune to all nonmagical damage.
	This transformation lasts until the end of your next turn. In addition, once before the duration is over, you can expend a spell slot of your choice and roll a number of d6 equal to the level of the spell slot. Upon doing so, you regain an amount of Hit Points equal to the result.

        <text>Curse weaving is not a power earned, rather one bestowed by fate. There are many ways to come about this power. Someone from your bloodline may have met their demise while bound by a horrible curse and now, in a twist of fate, you hold the same power. Or perhaps your ancestors had the ability to tap into the archaic magic of connections. You inherited that power in the form it is found today and are able to inherently mimic the correlations formed by Poppet magic.
	Now, through items others would deem mundane, you can weave powerful spells that leave those they touch devastated. Often viewed as a harbinger of misfortune or a mystical thaumaturgist, your abilities stem from the wicked forces that have been unwillingly thrust upon you.

The first time you cast a spell from the Curse Weaver spell list against a bound creature, you do not expend a spell slot. If the creature dies, the Motanka bound to it is immediately destroyed. Additionally, whenever you use Metamagic on a spell that targets a creature bound to a Motanka, you reduce the Sorcery Points spent by 1 (minimum of 0).
	You can have a number of Motanky up to your Proficiency Bonus at any time. If you create a new Motanka when you have reached this limit, the oldest Motanka withers away.
