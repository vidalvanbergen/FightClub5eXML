While the cover on this ring is open, the ring produces a flame that creates no heat and consumes no fuel. It sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. As a Bonus Action, you can close the cover, smothering the flame, or open it again.

Each of Cottle's black coaches is a Carriage (see the Player's Handbook) keyed to a unique sigil sequence.

All creatures inside the coach then teleport to that destination coach. If the destination coach is occupied, the teleport fails and the action is wasted.
	Alternatively, a creature inside the coach can use the combination dial to input a random sequence, teleporting all creatures inside to a random coach in Cottle's fleet.

    <text>This magical tattoo contains the essence of a level 1-3 spell chosen by the tattoo's creator. While the tattoo is on your body, you always have the associated spell prepared, and you can cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spell uses your spellcasting ability; otherwise, if the spell requires a saving throw or an attack roll, the spell save DC is 13 and the attack bonus is +5. If your Attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes.
	You can also cast the spell once without a spell slot and spell components. Once the spell is cast in this way, the tattoo vanishes.

Inking Thayan Spell Tattoos:
The Thayan art of magical tattooing is highly guarded by its practitioners, and thus, Thayan Spell Tattoos can't be crafted like other magic items. To learn how to ink Thayan Spell Tattoos, you must have a Renown Score of 50+ with the Red Wizards.
	To ink a Thayan Spell Tattoo, you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and with Calligrapher's Supplies and have the spell prepared each day of the inking. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed when you complete the tattoo. Inking a Thayan Spell Tattoo takes the same amount of time and money as scribing a Spell Scroll of an equivalent level.
