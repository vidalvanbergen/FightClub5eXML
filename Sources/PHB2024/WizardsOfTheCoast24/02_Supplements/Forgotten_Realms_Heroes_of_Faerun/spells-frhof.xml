    <text>For the duration, moonlight fills a 20-foot Emanation originating from you with Dim Light. While in that area, you and your allies have Half Cover and Resistance to Cold, Lightning, and Radiant damage.
	While the spell lasts, you can use one of the following options, ending the spell immediately:

Liberation: When you fail a saving throw to avoid or end the Frightened, Grappled, or Restrained condition, you can take a Reaction to succeed on the save instead.

Respite: As a Magic action, you or an ally within the area regains Hit Points equal to 4d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

    <text>Deathly power fills a 60-foot Emanation originating from you for the duration.
	When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature can't regain Hit Points while in the Emanation. Whenever the Emanation enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 Necrotic damage and has the Prone condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and its Speed is halved. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

Casting as a Circle Spell: Casting this as a Circle spell requires a minimum of two secondary casters. If the spell is cast as a Circle spell, its duration becomes Concentration, up to 10 minutes.
	A creature that fails its save against the spell's effect also gains 1 Exhaustion level. While the creature has Exhaustion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature's Exhaustion level.
	When the spell is cast, each secondary caster must expend a level 4+ spell slot; otherwise, the spell fails.

    <text>You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of inky fog within range. The fog is magical Darkness and lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by the Gust of Wind spell) disperses it, ending the spell.
	Each creature in the Sphere when it appears makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 Psychic damage and subtracts 1d6 from its saving throws until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the Sphere moves into its space, when it enters the Sphere, or when it ends its turn inside the Sphere. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
	The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.

Casting as a Circle Spell: Casting this as a Circle spell requires a minimum of five secondary casters. In addition to the spell's usual components, you must provide a special component (a string of three black pearls from Pandemonium), which the spell consumes. The spell's range increases to 1 mile, and its duration increases to until dispelled (no Concentration required). The spell ends early if any caster who participated in this casting contributes to another casting of Doomtide as a Circle spell.
	When the spell is cast, each secondary caster must expend a level 3+ spell slot; otherwise, the spell fails.

    <text>You hurl a disorienting magical force toward one creature within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw; Constructs and Undead automatically succeed on this save.
	On a failed save, the target takes 2d4 Force damage, its Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and on its next turn, it can take only an action or a Bonus Action (but not both). On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 2d4 for every spell slot level above 1.
