      <text>Though most youths in Chondath accept their four-year term of compulsory military service, you bristled at that authoritarian attempt to control your life. You forsook your nationhood, discarded your given name, and worked as a freebooter with the first ship that would have you. Since then, you've traveled the Vilhon Reach. Though you've never sailed more than a few dozen leagues from land, you make up for it with deep local connections and the breadth of your experiences.
