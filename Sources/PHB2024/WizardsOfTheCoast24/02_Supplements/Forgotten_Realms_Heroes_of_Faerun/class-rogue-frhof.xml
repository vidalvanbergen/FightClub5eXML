        <name>Rogue Subclass: Scion of the Three</name>
        <text>Become a Gruesome Agent of Malice

A Scion of the Three draws power from a group of malevolent gods known as the Dead Three: Bane, deity of tyranny; Bhaal, deity of violence and murder; and Myrkul, deity of death. While some Rogues of this subclass pledge themselves ardently to those three macabre gods, others find themselves thrust on this path by a curse. Either way, a scion's power manifests as various occult gifts, as well as an uncanny talent for striking and terrifying foes.

Scions of the Three are most common in Baldur's Gate, where the Dead Three have long competed for influence over mortal hearts. Underground cults to Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul often count Scions of the Three among their most useful agents. Outside Baldur's Gate, secular thieves' guilds such as the Shadow Thieves of Amn or Xanathar's guild in Waterdeep might cautiously call on a Scion of the Three to undertake an especially violent contract.

        <text>When an enemy you can see within 30 feet of yourself takes damage and is Bloodied after taking that damage but not killed outright, you can take a Reaction and teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of that enemy. You can then make one melee attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

        <name>Level 9: Strike Fear (Scion of the Three)</name>
        <text>You gain the following Cunning Strike option.

Terrify (Cost: 1d6). The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While the target is Frightened in this way, you have Advantage on attack rolls against the target.

The Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

        <name>Level 13: Aura of Malevolence (Scion of the Three)</name>
        <text>You radiate malignant power associated with one of the Dead Three. When you use Bloodthirst and teleport, each creature of your choice within 10 feet of either the space you left or your destination space (your choice) takes damage equal to your Intelligence modifier; the damage type is the same as the damage Resistance granted by your choice in the Dread Allegiance feature. Damage dealt by this feature ignores Resistance.
