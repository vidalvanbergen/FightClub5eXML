    <trait category="description">
      <name>Description</name>
      <text>With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside in many societies undetected. Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.
	The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today—even in those who have never set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.
	In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see one in that form, for a typical changeling alters their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities with more depth, crafting a persona complete with history and beliefs to go with each shape. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.
	Multiple changelings can share a persona; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even pass down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.

You can't duplicate the appearance of an individual you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have.

      <text>Kalashtar (pronounced kal-ASH-tar) are created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits called quori from the plane of dreams. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. They have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are concentrating or expressing strong emotions.
	Kalashtar can't communicate directly with their quori spirits. Rather, kalashtar might experience them as a source of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the spirits' memories when the kalashtar sleep. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psionic attacks.

When you're using this trait to speak telepathically to a creature, you can take a Magic action to give that creature the ability to speak telepathically with you for 1 hour or until you take another Magic action to end this effect.
	  
Telepathy: The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language to understand this communication, but the contacted creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself to understand.
	A telepath doesn't need to see a contacted creature, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic contact can't be initiated and is immediately broken if either the telepath or the other creature has the Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also broken if the contacted creature is no longer within the telepathy's range or if the telepath contacts a different creature within range.
	Once a telepathic conversation starts, the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the telepath until the telepathic connection ends.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Over the course of centuries, those descended from both humans and elves have developed their own communities and traditions in Khorvaire. The rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani has strengthened this identity. Members of these communities call themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning "children of Khorvaire," as they dislike the term "half-elf."
	Many Khoravar espouse the idea of being "the bridge between," believing they are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others, fascinated by their distant connection to the Fey, seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become druids or warlocks with archfey patrons.

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Warforged are mechanical beings built as weapons to fight in the Last War. An unexpected breakthrough produced sentient beings made from wood and metal that nevertheless can feel pain and emotion.
	Warforged comprise a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Rootlike cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. The more a warforged cultivates their individuality, the more likely they are to modify their body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of their face, limbs, and plating.
