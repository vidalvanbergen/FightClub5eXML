    <trait>
      <name>Rogue</name>
      <text>Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.
	In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.
	Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue's relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

        <name>Level 3: Psionic Power (Soulknife)</name>
        <text>You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass. The Soul knife Energy Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you reach certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.

Psionic Power:
Rogue Level | Die Size | Number
3 | D6 | 4
5 | D8 | 6
9 | D8 | 8
11 | D10 | 8
13 | D10 | 10
17 | D12 | 12

Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from t his subclass. Some of your powers expend a Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your Psionic Energy Dice are all expended.
	You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a Short Rest. and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.

Psi-Bolstered Knack. If you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. The die is expended only if the roll then succeeds.

Psychic Whispers. You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As a Magic action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required).
	The first time you use this power after each Long Rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy Die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.

        <name>Level 3: Psychic Blades (Soulknife)</name>
        <text>You can manifest shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action or make an Opportunity Attack, you can manifest a Psychic Blade in your free hand and make the attack with that blade. The magic blade has the following traits:

Weapon Category: Simple Melee
Damage on a Hit: 1d6 Psychic plus the ability modifier used for the attack roll
Properties: Finesse, Thrown (range 60/120 feet)
Mastery: Vex (you can use this property, and it doesn't count against the number of properties you can use with Weapon Mastery)

The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark if it deals damage.
	After you attack with the blade on your turn, you can make a melee or ranged attack with a second psychic blade as a Bonus Action on the same turn if your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4 instead of 1d6.
