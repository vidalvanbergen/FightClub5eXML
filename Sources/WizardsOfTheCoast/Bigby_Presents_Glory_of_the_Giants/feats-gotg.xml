    <text>You've manifested the fiery combat emblematic of fire giants, granting you the following benefits:

Ability Score Increase:
Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

Born of Flame:
You have resistance to fire damage.

Searing Ignition:
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace a single attack with a magical burst of flame. Each creature of your choice in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability increased by this feat). On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to 1d8 + your proficiency bonus, and it has the blinded condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. You can use your Searing Ignition a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus (but no more than once per turn), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Blinded:
	• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

    <text>You've studied the magic of Giant runes, granting you the following benefits:

While you are wearing or carrying any rune-marked object, you can cast the spells associated with those runes using any spell slots you have.

You can also invoke a rune inscribed on an object you are wearing or carrying and cast its associated spell without expending a spell slot or using material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Your spellcasting ability for this feat is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).

Each time you gain a level, you can replace one of the runes you know with another one from the Rune Spells table.
