<text>This massive adze is said to have been wielded by All-Father Annam, not as a weapon but as the tool he used to shape the various worlds of the Material Plane eons ago.

Random Properties: The adze has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 2 minor detrimental properties

Magic Weapon: When a creature attunes to the adze, the artifact magically adjusts its size so that creature can wield it as a greataxe. The adze is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the adze deals an additional 3d12 force damage. It also deals double damage to objects and structures.

Divine Mattock: As an action, you can call upon the might of the All-Father and use the adze to cast move earth or fabricate. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

<text>This gorgeous jewelry piece, crafted by the wizard Bigby himself, consists of four gold rings attached via delicate chains to a wrist cuff studded with sapphires and diamonds.

Random Properties: The bracelet has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

	• 1 minor beneficial property
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 1 minor detrimental property

Dexterous Fingers: While wearing the bracelet, you can cast mage hand.

Force Sculpture: By focusing and channeling the bracelet's magic for 1 minute, you can create a spectral copy of a Large or smaller nonmagical object. The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and it is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it's copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object.

The copy is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled, but a disintegrate spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action.

The bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn.

Helpful Hand: As an action, you can use the bracelet to cast Bigby's hand as a 9th-level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn't require concentration. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

<text>The back of this weatherworn leather glove is adorned with three large metal hooks shaped like a mole's claws. Stitched into the glove's palm is the mountain rune.

The glove is considered a simple melee weapon with the finesse and light properties, and it deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit. While attuned to the glove, you gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and blindsight to 15 feet.

Invoking the Rune: As an action, you can invoke the glove's rune to bolster yourself with the sturdiness of the earth. Spend and roll a number of your unspent Hit Dice up to a maximum equal to your proficiency bonus. You then regain a number of hit points equal to the total roll plus your Constitution modifier.

When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a Giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

<text>This set of 1d4 + 2 small paint pots contains pigments mixed from crushed luminescent gemstones. This magical paint bestows temporary magical gifts on creatures with runes drawn on their skin with this paint.

One paint pot contains enough pigment to paint one rune. A creature can spend 10 minutes to paint one of the following runes onto itself or another creature:Journey Rune. difficult terrain doesn't cost the painted creature extra movement.

Life Rune:
The painted creature gains 10 temporary hit points and has advantage on death saving throws.

Light Rune:
The painted creature gains darkvision to a range of 30 feet. If the painted creature already has darkvision from another source, the range of its darkvision increases by 30 feet.

Mountain Rune:
The painted creature is immune to being knocked prone and has advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws.

Shield Rune:
The painted creature has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that deal damage.

A creature can benefit from only one painted rune at a time, so a new rune painted on a creature has no effect unless the old one is removed first. The rune's benefits last for 8 hours or until the painted creature uses its action to wipe away the rune.

<text>This golden harp is sculpted in the image of the god Iallanis, depicted as a young cloud giant woman. When a creature comes within 5 feet of the harp, the instrument animates and is capable of speaking, singing, and playing by itself.

Whenever you attempt to attune to the harp, you must first make either a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check or a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the harp that you are worthy, attuning to the harp on a success. If you fail, you can't attempt to attune to the harp again until the next dawn. Once you have successfully attuned to the harp, the harp resizes to suit you.

Stalwart Song: Whenever you make a Charisma check while attuned to the harp, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the die as a 10.

Feast of Plenty: If you spend 10 minutes playing the harp, you can cast the heroes' feast spell from it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until 1d10 + 10 days have passed.

Soothing Melody: As an action, you can use the harp to cast the calm emotions spell (save DC 19). When the spell is cast using the harp, its duration increases to 1 hour, provided you maintain concentration on the spell. This property can be used five times, and it regains all uses at dawn.

Sentience: The harp is a sentient, chaotic good object with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet.

The harp can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant. It can also communicate telepathically with the creature attuned to it.

The harp has a dramatic and pompous personality, taking extreme pride in the quality of music produced from its strings. If the harp is shorter than 6 feet tall, it bemoans its height.

<text>This copper-hued helm contains a shard of the Elemental Chaos embedded in its forehead, surrounded by a motif of a rising sun. Legend says Annam fashioned this helm for his daughter Diancastra to hold the fragment of chaos she used to prove her worth to her father.

Random Properties: The helm has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 1 minor detrimental property

Master of Guile: While wearing the helm, you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Wisdom (Insight) checks.

Arrow of Elemental Havoc: As a bonus action while wearing the helm, you can launch a bolt of searing elemental energy toward a creature you can see within 90 feet of yourself. The target must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

Spellcasting: The helm has 6 charges and regains 1d6 charges each dawn. As an action while wearing the helm, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20): elemental weapon (1 charge), call lightning (2 charges), wall of fire (3 charges), conjure elemental (4 charges), tsunami (5 charges).

A functioning puzzle cube can be solved with 30 minutes of work and a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check. When the cube is solved, a 30-foot-diameter portal appears before the creature who solved the cube, leading to the northeastern platform of Horizon's Edge. The portal is two-way and remains open for 10 minutes or until a creature uses an action to change the puzzle's configuration. Puzzle cubes don't function while on Horizon's Edge, but a device somewhere in the demiplane allows a cube to function in reverse while the cube is fitted into it.

<text>This ivory longbow is inscribed with a prayer to the god Hiatea, the runes of which are entwined with gilded engravings of wheat stalks and deer antlers.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one magic arrow when you pull back the string. The arrow created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

The bow has 8 charges for the following properties, which you can use while wielding the bow. The bow regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.

Curative Arrow: When you take the Attack action using the bow, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your attacks with a blazing arrow of curative magic, which automatically hits one creature you can see within 150 feet of you. The target can then immediately spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

If the target has no unspent Hit Dice remaining, nothing happens. You can use a curative arrow only once per turn.

Spellcasting: While holding the bow, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 18): create food and water (1 charge), warding bond (2 charges), guardian of faith (3 charges).

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Heavy: Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

As an action, you can invoke the weapon's rune to cast the sunbeam spell (save DC 17) with it. Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

Proficiency: martial, musket

<text>This thick, fur-lined cloak has the frost rune stitched on the hem in silvery blue thread. Frigid wind swirls around the cloak, regardless of the weather.

While wearing this cloak, you have resistance to cold damage. Additionally, when you move within 5 feet of a creature, you can cause the cloak's cold wind to buffet the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and have the prone condition. A creature can be affected by the mantle only once during a turn.

Invoking the Rune: As an action, you can invoke the mantle's rune to cast the sleet storm spell (save DC 14) with it. When you use the mantle to cast the spell, the area of the spell isn't difficult terrain for you, and you can see through the storm, ignoring the normal penalties of a heavily obscured area.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

<text>The design of this bronze circlet resembles swirling clouds. At its center is set a deep-blue stone, upon which is inscribed the cloud rune.

While wearing this circlet, you take no damage from falling. Additionally, as a bonus action, you and everything you are wearing or carrying can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of yourself, reappearing in a puff of shimmering clouds.

Invoking the Rune: As an action, you can invoke the circlet's rune to assume a cloudlike form. The form lasts for 1 minute, until you are incapacitated, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

While in cloud form, you have a flying speed of 60 feet and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

<text>Said to be infused with the wisdom and power of the god Skoraeus, this polished stone orb is veined with iridescent crystal that seems to glow from within. The orb is 8 inches in diameter and weighs 8 pounds, making it a palm-sized trinket for a stone giant but a more unwieldy item for a Medium creature to use.

While holding this orb, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells. You also gain the following benefits:

Abundant Components: The orb has 3 charges and regains all expended charges at dawn. When you cast a spell while holding this orb, you can expend up to 3 charges to ignore the spell's material components with a gold piece cost, up to 300 gp per charge expended.

Astute Mind: You gain a +2 bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell.

Divine Sight: You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

As an action, you can throw a prehistoric figurine of wondrous power to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the figurine magically transforms into a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the Monster Manual for the creature's statistics.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

Carnelian Triceratops: This figurine becomes a triceratops for up to 6 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 10 days have passed.

Whenever you command the figurine while it's in tyrannosaurus rex form (including commanding it to revert to figurine form), you must roll a d20. On a 1, you lose control of the figurine, and it becomes hostile to you and your companions until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to figurine form.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you gain 10 temporary hit points. Any creature that hits you with a melee attack while you have 1 or more of these temporary hit points takes 10 necrotic damage.

Invoking the Rune: As a bonus action, you can invoke the weapon's rune, unleashing the screams of every creature slain by the weapon in one cacophonous burst. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the stunned condition until the start of your next turn.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

<text>This ring is carved from hematite and bears an engraving of the friend rune.

When you first attune to this ring, you can touch one willing creature and form a magical bond between the two of you. While this bond lasts, whenever you are subjected to a spell or magical effect that restores hit points, the bonded creature also receives the benefits of the spell or effect.

You can bond with a different creature whenever you finish a long rest, provided that you can touch the creature and the creature is willing.

A creature can benefit from only one ring of amity's bond at a time. The bond ends if either you or the creature travels to a different plane of existence, if you bond with a different creature at the end of a long rest, or if you sever the bond as a bonus action.

Invoking the Rune: When the bonded creature hits a target with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the ring's rune if you are within 60 feet of the bonded creature. The bonded creature's attack is then turned into a critical hit.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

You can use a bonus action to activate the shield, causing glowing lava to flow through the shield's grooves for 1 minute. While the shield is active, you gain the following benefits:

Blazing Soul: You have immunity to fire damage.

Cleansing Fire: As an action, you can cause the shield to flare with the cleansing fire of the god Surtur. Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself (you can choose yourself). One disease or condition of your choice affecting this creature ends immediately; the condition can be blinded, charmed, deafened, or poisoned.

Shield Bash: When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a shield bash, targeting one creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. The target must make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus 3d6 fire damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. You can use Shield Bash only once per turn.

Once the shield has been activated, it can't be activated again until the next dawn.

The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The first time you hit any creature with the staff on your turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be restrained by spectral vines until the start of your next turn.

Once the rune has been invoked to cast either spell, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Invoking the Rune:
As a bonus action, you can invoke the weapon's rune to launch a ball of energy to a point you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The energy then detonates into a 10-foot-radius sphere of turbulent wind and thunder centered on that point, and each creature in that sphere must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.

Additionally, whenever you finish a long rest, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You have resistance to the chosen damage type until you finish another long rest.

Invoking the Runes: As a bonus action, you can invoke the gauntlets' runes and summon two enormous spectral fists that envelop the gauntlets and mimic your hand motions. The fists can also launch themselves to strike distant opponents, returning immediately to your space after they hit or miss.

The fists last for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. While the spectral fists are active, unarmed strikes you make on your turn have a reach of 30 feet, and when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack made with your unarmed strike, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or have the prone condition.

<text>This fine set of white-and-silver armor bears the wind rune upon its chest.

While wearing this armor, you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Dexterity saving throws as your movements are bolstered by gentle currents of wind.

Invoking the Rune: As an action, you can invoke the armor's rune to cast the wind wall spell (save DC 15) with it. Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.
