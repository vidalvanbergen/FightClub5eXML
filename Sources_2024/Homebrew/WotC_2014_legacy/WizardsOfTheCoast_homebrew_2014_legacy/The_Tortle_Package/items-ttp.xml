<text>You can use an action to blow this pearlescent conch like a horn, creating an effect identical with that of a Leomund's tiny hut spell. The conch disappears once the spell takes effect. The effect ends if you leave the spell's area.

<text>Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can't wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.
