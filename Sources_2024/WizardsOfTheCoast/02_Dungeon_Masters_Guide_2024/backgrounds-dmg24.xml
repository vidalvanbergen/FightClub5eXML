      <name>Description</name>
      <text>A character's background represents what the character did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating a unique background or customizing an existing one from the Player's Handbook can reflect the particular theme of your campaign or elements of your world. You can also create a background to help a player craft the story they have in mind for their character.</text>
