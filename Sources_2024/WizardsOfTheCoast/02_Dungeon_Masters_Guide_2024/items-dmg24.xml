<text>This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

The Apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30 ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren't extended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.

Lever | Up | Down
1 | Legs extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim. | Legs retract, reducing the apparatus's Speed and Swim Speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.
2 | Forward window shutter opens. | Forward window shutter closes.
3 | Side window shutters open (two per side). | Side window shutters close (two per side).
4 | Two claws extend from the front side of the apparatus. | The claws retract.
5 | Each extended claw makes the following melee attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. Hit: 7 (2d6) Bludgeoning damage. | Each extended claw makes the following melee attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. Hit: The target has the Grappled condition (escape DC 15).
6 | The apparatus walks or swims forward provided its legs are extended. | The apparatus walks or swims backward provided its legs are extended.
7 | The apparatus turns 90 degrees counterclockwise provided its legs are extended. | The apparatus turns 90 degrees clockwise provided its legs are extended.
8 | Eyelike fixtures emit Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. | The light turns off.
9 | The apparatus sinks up to 20 feet if it's in liquid. | The apparatus rises up to 20 feet if it's in liquid.
10 | The rear hatch unseals and opens. | The rear hatch closes and seals.

<text>This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the DM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.

Arrows are used with a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

Arrows are typically stored in a Quiver (bought separately).

Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

<text>As long as this weapon is within your reach and you are attuned to it, you and allies within 30 feet of you gain the following benefits.

Alarm: The weapon magically awakens each subject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. This benefit doesn't wake a subject from magically induced sleep.

Supernatural Readiness: Each subject has Advantage on its Initiative rolls.

Slow (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

    <text type="detail">Artifact (requires attunement)</text>
<text>A young dwarf prince set out to forge a weapon that would be regarded as a symbol of unity among his people. Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, a god of creation, he first crafted four mighty tools: the Starmetal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With these tools, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.

Armed with the Artifact, the prince brought peace to the dwarf clans, ending grudges and answering slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.

Later, in an era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.

Magic Weapon: The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

When you attack a creature with the axe and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the axe deals an extra 20 Slashing damage.

The axe has Thrown with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is a creature of the Giant type. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.

Blessings of Moradin: While attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:

Darkvision: You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.

Fortitude of Stone: Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.

Gifts of the Creator: You have proficiency with Brewer's Supplies, Mason's Tools, and Smith's Tools.

One with the Forge: You have Immunity to Poison damage and Resistance to Fire damage.

Sunder: When you hit an object with the axe, the object takes the maximum amount of damage possible.

Conjure Earth Elemental: While holding the axe, you can take a Magic action to summon an Earth Elemental. It appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 24 hours, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.

Random Properties: The axe has the following random properties:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 2 minor detrimental properties

Travel the Depths: You can take a Magic action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast Teleport from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.

Destroying the Axe: The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 50 years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

<text>The archfey Baba Yaga crafted many of these magic brooms. No two appear exactly alike. While holding the broom, you can take a Magic action to transform it into an Animated Broom under your control. The broom then moves into an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The broom acts immediately after you on your Initiative count and remains animate until you take a Bonus Action and use a command word to render it inanimate.

On your turn, you can mentally command the animated broom if it is within 30 feet of you and you don't have the Incapacitated condition (no action required). You decide what action the broom takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the broom is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters and is destroyed. If the broom reverts to its inanimate form before losing all its Hit Points it regains all of them.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <detail>rare</detail>
    <text type="detail">Rare</text>
<text>This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans.

If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table or determine it randomly.

1d100 | Effect
01 | 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.
02-10 | A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (DM's choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes.
11-20 | A Treant sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even roll, the treant is Chaotic Good.
21-30 | An animate but immobile stone statue in your likeness rises and makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours.
31-40 | A campfire with green flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is extinguished.
41-50 | Three Shrieker Fungi sprout.
51-60 | 1d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the DM's choice that acts in accordance with its alignment and nature. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink smoke.
61-70 | A hungry Bulette burrows up and attacks.
71-80 | A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined potions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.
81-90 | A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 Force damage from an internal explosion.
91-95 | A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a burial chamber containing a Mummy, a Mummy Lord, or some other Undead of the DM's choice. Its sarcophagus contains treasure of the DM's choice.
96-00 | A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the DM's choice. The top leads where the DM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant's castle, or another plane of existence.

    <text type="detail">Very rare</text>
<text>This bag resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can take an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Another creature can take an action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, provided the puller isn't pulled inside the bag first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

<text>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a Utilize action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. The bag holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward's Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can't be reopened.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies, and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative count. You can take a Bonus Action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature in the Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are partially within the area are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.

An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's Speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your Hit Points maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

Curse: This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have Disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one.

Whenever another creature damages you while the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. This berserk state ends when you start your turn and there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

While berserk, you regard the creature nearest to you that you can see or hear as your enemy. If there are multiple possible creatures, choose one at random. On each of your turns, you must move as close to the creature as possible and take the Attack action, targeting the creature. If you're unable to get close enough to the creature to attack it with the weapon, your turn ends after you've used up all your available movement. If the creature dies or can no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest creature that you can see or hear becomes your new target.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Additionally, you can focus your senses as a Magic action to discern the distance and direction to the closest black dragon within 30 miles of yourself. This action can't be used again until the next dawn.

<text>Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, Blackrazor shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut obsidian.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you hit an Undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage, and the target regains 1d10 Hit Points. If this Necrotic damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, Blackrazor devours your soul (see "Devour Soul" below).

While you hold this weapon, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions, and you have Blindsight with a range of 30 feet.

Devour Soul: Whenever you use Blackrazor to reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul unless it is a Construct or an Undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a Wish spell.

When Blackrazor devours a soul that isn't yours, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the slain creature's Hit Point maximum.

Haste: Blackrazor can cast Haste on you, after which it can't cast this spell again until the next dawn. Blackrazor decides when to cast the spell, which takes effect at the start of your turn. The spell lasts for 1 minute (no Concentration required) or until Blackrazor decides to end it, which it can do at the end of any of your turns.

Sentience: Blackrazor is a sentient Chaotic Neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.

The weapon speaks Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know.

Personality: Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.

Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be reunited and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm and finds Wave tedious.

Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes 3 days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.

Destroying Blackrazor: Blackrazor can be destroyed by crushing it in the great gears of Mechanus. Primus, the creator of the modrons, also knows a series of musical tones that Blackrazor can't stand to hear, causing the sword to shatter.

Graze (Mastery): If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

Heavy: You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and  your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

Two-Handed: A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Alarm: The weapon magically awakens each subject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. This benefit doesn't wake a subject from magically induced sleep.

Supernatural Readiness: Each subject has Advantage on its Initiative rolls.

Vex (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

<text>This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the DM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.

Crossbow bolts are used with a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

Bolts are typically stored in a Crossbow Bolt Case (bought separately).

<text>The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's authors filled the pages with their own visions of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.

The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring hope to an endangered world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.

A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits.

Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. A Fiend, an Undead, or a servant of a god from the Lower Planes that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 Radiant damage. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity, and it can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage disappears in a flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. The book then vanishes, and the creature's Attunement to it ends.

Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.

Celestial Calm: While attuned to the book, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and Resistance to Psychic damage. These benefits become permanent after you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book.

Divine Wisdom: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once.

Enlightened Magic: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.

Halo: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a Bonus Action. While present, the halo gives you Advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks. In addition, Fiends and Undead within the halo's Bright Light make attack rolls against you with Disadvantage.

Random Properties: The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties
	• 2 major beneficial properties

Destroying the Book: The Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.

<text>The contents of this foul manuscript are the meat and drink of the wicked. It contains knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites doom.

Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every horrid idea, every corrupt thought, and every example of foul magic he came across or devised.

Other practitioners of evil have added their own input to the book's catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.

Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, common animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.

Whenever a creature that isn't a Fiend or an Undead attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature makes a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically transformed into a Larva under the DM's control. Only a Wish spell can reverse this vile transformation.

A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and use its Adjusted Ability Scores, Tireless Form, Spells, Vile Lore, and Vile Speech properties.

The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears, your Attunement to it ends immediately, and you lose all benefits granted by it. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.

Adjusted Ability Scores: One ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.

Tireless Form: While the book is on your person, you have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition.

Random Properties: The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:

	• 3 minor beneficial properties
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 3 minor detrimental properties
	• 2 major detrimental properties

Spells: While holding the book and holding it, you can cast the following spells (save DC 18) from it:

	• Animate Dead
	• Circle of Death
	• Dominate Monster
	• Finger of Death

Once you use the book to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.

Vile Lore: You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, you have Advantage on that check.

At the DM's discretion, the book might reveal secrets no mortal should know, such as the true names of powerful Fiends, foul rites that allow one to transform into a death knight or lich, or long-lost spells crafted by beings so evil their names ought never to be spoken aloud.

Vile Speech: While the book is on your person, you can take a Magic action to recite words from its pages in a foul, dead language. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 Psychic damage, and each creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 Psychic damage unless the creature is a Fiend or an Undead.

Destroying the Book: The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.

If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it re-forms in some far corner of the multiverse.

A creature attuned to the book for 100 years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book re-forms 1d10 x 100 years later.

It has a Fly Speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its Fly Speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land or when you're no longer riding it.

As a Magic action, you can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you name the location and are familiar with it. The broom comes back to you when you take a Magic action and use a command word if the broom is still within 1 mile of you.

<text>This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a Magic action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have Advantage on D20 Tests. In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast Gate with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the DM or determined by rolling on the following table.

1d100 | Outer Plane
01-05 | Abyss

<text>This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast-iron sides.

You can use the cauldron as a Spellcasting Focus for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the Scrying spell.

Brew Potion: When you finish a Long Rest, you can use the cauldron to create a Potion of Greater Healing, which takes 1 minute. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

Raise Dead: As a Magic action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as a Magic action, harmlessly shunting anything that can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a Humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 GP) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by Raise Dead at the next dawn. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days.

<text>As long as this weapon is within your reach and you are attuned to it, you and allies within 30 feet of you gain the following benefits.

Alarm: The weapon magically awakens each subject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. This benefit doesn't wake a subject from magically induced sleep.

Supernatural Readiness: Each subject has Advantage on its Initiative rolls.

Slow (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

Light: When you take the Attack action on your turn and. attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

Roll on the Cube of Summoning table to determine which spell the cube casts to summon the creature. The spell is cast at level 5 and doesn't require Concentration, and the summoned creature views you as its summoner.

Once the cube summons a creature, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

<text>As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch adamantine statuette on the ground and, using a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a square adamantine tower. Repeating the command word causes the tower to revert to statuette form, which works only if the tower is empty. Each creature in the area where the tower appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried are also pushed clear of the tower.

The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When created, the tower has a single door at ground level on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the Knock spell and similar magic.

Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20; HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege equipment; and Resistance to all other damage. Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form doesn't repair damage to the tower. Only a Wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower). Each casting of Wish causes the tower to regain all its Hit Points.

<text>This amulet is fashioned from a shard of resilient material originating from an otherworldly realm. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

Spellcasting Focus: You can use the amulet as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

Unknown Spell: As a Magic action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Warlock spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast it is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a Long Rest.

<text>As long as this weapon is within your reach and you are attuned to it, you and allies within 30 feet of you gain the following benefits.

Alarm: The weapon magically awakens each subject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. This benefit doesn't wake a subject from magically induced sleep.

Supernatural Readiness: Each subject has Advantage on its Initiative rolls.

Vex (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

<text>This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.

You can take a Magic action to remove the stopper and issue one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following command words:

Splash: The decanter produces 1 gallon of water.

Fountain: The decanter produces 5 gallons of water.

Geyser: The decanter produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a Line 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. If you're holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser in one direction (no action required). One creature of your choice in the Line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition. Instead of a creature, you can target one object in the Line that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is knocked over by the geyser.

    <text type="detail">Uncommon</text>
<text>This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.

Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

<text>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Deck of Many Things table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)

Each card's effect is described below.

Balance: You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can't decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.

Comet: The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect.

Donjon: You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

Euryale: The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.

Fates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

Flames: A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

Fool: You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws.

Gem: Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.

Jester: You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

Key: A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon.

Knight: You gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.

Moon: You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.

Puzzle: Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

Rogue: An NPC of the DM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

Ruin: All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the the Dungeon Master's Guide), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

Sage: At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.

Skull: An Avatar of Death appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life.

Star: Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.

Sun: A magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.

Talons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.

Throne: You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.

Void: Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A Wish spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

    <text type="detail">Artifact (requires attunement)</text>
<text>This treatise, composed by Iggwilv the archmage, documents the Abyss's layers and inhabitants and is widely regarded as the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.

Abyssal Lore: You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you gain Advantage on the check.

Containment: The first ten pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As a Magic action while holding the book, you can target a Fiend that you can see that is trapped within the area of a Magic Circle spell. The Fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with Disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you finish a Long Rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, one trapped creature within the book can attempt to possess you. You make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. As a Magic action, the possessing creature can release you and appear in the closest unoccupied space to you. On a successful save, the Fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days (but another Fiend trapped in the book can certainly try).

When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 Fiends occupying its pages—typically an assortment of demons.

Ensnarement: While carrying the book, whenever you cast Magic Circle naming only Fiends or cast Planar Binding targeting a Fiend, the spell is cast at level 9, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the Fiend has Disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.

Fiendish Scourging: While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a Fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.

Random Properties: The Artifact has the following random properties:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties
	• 1 minor detrimental property
	• 1 major detrimental property

Spells: The book has 8 charges and regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the book, you can take a Magic action to cast one of the spells (save DC 20) on the following table. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

Spell | Charge Cost
Magic Circle | 1
Magic Jar | 3
Planar Ally | 3
Planar Binding | 2
Plane Shift (to the Abyss only) | 3
Summon Fiend | 3
Tasha's Hideous Laughter | 0

Destroying the Demonomicon: To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semisentient domain lies a long-lost Artifact, Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation of the Demonomicon of Iggwilv. The Tome of Zyx can be destroyed like any ordinary book. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu knows instantly.

<text>You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.

Nick (Mastery): When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action in· stead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

<text>This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you are within 60 feet of it, you can command it to emanate light equivalent to that of the Light or Daylight spell (your choice). Once used, the Daylight effect can't be used again until the next dawn.

You can issue another command as a Magic action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.

Immediately after an affected creature makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible condition ends for that creature.

As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.

As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental or a Water Weird). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the Incapacitated condition and is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a Lesser Restoration spell.

The first time the bottle is opened, the DM rolls on the following table to determine what happens.

1d10 | Effect
1 | The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.
2-9 | The efreeti understands your languages and obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.
10 | The efreeti understands your languages and can cast Wish once for you. It disappears when it grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.

<text>This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you take a Utilize action to break the gem, an Earth Elemental is summoned, and the gem ceases to be magical. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the broken gem as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action.

<text>This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the DM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.

<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has no string. Each time you pull your arm back in a firing motion, a magical arrow made of golden energy appears nocked and ready to fire. An arrow produced by this weapon deals Force damage instead of Piercing damage on a hit, and it disappears after it hits or misses its target. Until it disappears, the arrow emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.

This weapon has the following additional properties.

Arrow of Restraint: Whenever you use this weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature, you can try to restrain the target instead of dealing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action, a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful check.

Arrow of Transport: As a Magic action, you can fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried, provided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.

Energy Ladder: As a Magic action, you can loose a flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows become glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, forming a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall. This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.

Slow (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Heavy: You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and  your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

Two-Handed: A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

<text>As a Magic action, you can open or close this bottle.

Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot Emanation originating from the bottle. The area within the smoke is Heavily Obscured.

Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum size of 120 feet.

Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. A strong wind (such as that created by the Gust of Wind spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.

<text>Vecna was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.

A treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna's rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna's will in the world.

The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.

Random Properties of the Eye and Hand: The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties

	• 1 minor beneficial property
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 1 minor detrimental property

Attuning to the Eye: To attune to the eye, you must press it into your empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. If the eye is ever removed, you die.

Properties of the Eye: While you are attuned to the eye, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:

Truesight: You have Truesight out to 240 feet.

Spellcasting: The eye has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Eye of Vecna Spells table from the eye (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control.

Spell | Charge Cost
Clairvoyance | 2
Crown of Madness 1
Disintegrate | 4
Dominate Monster |5
Eyebite | 4

X-ray Vision: You can take a Magic action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through themselves. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

Attuning to the Hand: To attune to the hand, you must press it against the stump where your left hand was. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.

Properties of the Hand: When you are attuned to the hand, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:

Great Strength: Your Strength becomes 20 unless it is already 20 or higher.

Icy Touch: Any melee spell attack you make with the hand and any melee attack made with a weapon held by it deals an extra 2d8 Cold damage on a hit.

Spellcasting: The hand has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Hand of Vecna Spells table from the hand (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from it, the hand casts Suggestion on you (save DC 18; no Concentration required), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.

Spell | Charge Cost
Finger of Death | 5
Sleep | 1
Slow | 2
Teleport | 3

Properties of the Eye and Hand: While attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:

Danger Sense: You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.

Necrotic Reduction: As a Magic action, you can target one creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is transformed into green slime (see chapter 3) that covers the ground in its space, each 5-foot square of slime representing a separate patch. Nonmagical objects worn or carried by the target that are made of metal or organic material are destroyed by the slime.

Poison Immunity: You have Immunity to Poison damage and the Poisoned condition.

Regeneration: If you start your turn with at least 1 Hit Point, you regain 1d10 Hit Points.

Wish: You can cast Wish. Once used, this property can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

Destroying the Eye and Hand: If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.

Ivory Goats (Rare): These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

Goat of Terror: This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance, and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

Goat of Traveling: This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.

Goat of Travail: This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

<text>This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring a Magic action to use:

First Command Word: The box unfolds into a Rowboat.

Second Command Word: The box unfolds into a Keelboat.

Third Command Word: The Folding Boat folds back into a box if no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can't fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

Statistics for the Rowboat and Keelboat appear in the the Player's Handbook 2024. If either vessel is reduced to 0 Hit Points, the Folding Boat is destroyed.

First Command Word: The gem sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a Bonus Action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.

Second Command Word: You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Third Command Word: You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.

When you hit a Giant with this weapon, the Giant takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Prone condition.

Nick (Mastery): When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action in· stead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

Light: When you take the Attack action on your turn and. attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Curse: This weapon is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

In addition, while the weapon is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage from another creature in combat. On a failed save, you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 Hit Points or it does or until you can't reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.

You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting Banishment on the weapon forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The weapon then becomes a +1 Weapon with no other properties.

Graze (Mastery): If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

Additionally, you can focus your senses as a Magic action to discern the distance and direction to the closest green dragon within 30 miles of yourself. This action can't be used again until the next dawn.

<text>A Hag Eye has 3 charges. While wearing or holding this item, you can expend 1 charge to cast Darkvision (targeting yourself only) or See Invisibility. The Hag Eye regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Coven Sensor: The Hag Eye is usually entrusted to a hag's minion for safekeeping and transport. As a Magic action, a hag who belongs to the coven that created the Hag Eye can see what the Hag Eye sees if the hag and the Hag Eye are on the same plane of existence. This effect lasts as long as the hag maintains Concentration. Multiple hags in the coven can see through the Hag Eye simultaneously.

Creating a Hag Eye: Only a hag coven can craft this item, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or another wearable item. A hag coven can have only one Hag Eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a special rite. This rite takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it if one or more of them has the Incapacitated condition. If the hags take any other actions during this rite, the rite fails and ends.

Alarm: The weapon magically awakens each subject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. This benefit doesn't wake a subject from magically induced sleep.

Supernatural Readiness: Each subject has Advantage on its Initiative rolls.

Vex (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Light: When you take the Attack action on your turn and. attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

<text>Vecna was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.

A treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna's rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna's will in the world.

The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.

Random Properties of the Eye and Hand. The Hand of Vecna has the following random properties:

	• 1 minor beneficial property
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 1 minor detrimental property

Attuning to the Hand: To attune to the hand, you must press it against the stump where your left hand was. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.

Properties of the Hand: When you are attuned to the hand, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:

Great Strength: Your Strength becomes 20 unless it is already 20 or higher.

Icy Touch: Any melee spell attack you make with the hand and any melee attack made with a weapon held by it deals an extra 2d8 Cold damage on a hit.

Spellcasting: The hand has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Hand of Vecna Spells table from the hand (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from it, the hand casts Suggestion on you (save DC 18; no Concentration required), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.

Spell | Charge Cost
Finger of Death | 5
Sleep | 1
Slow | 2
Teleport | 3

Destroying the Eye and Hand: If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.

<text>This pointed hat has the following properties.

Spellcasting Focus: While holding the hat, you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. Any spell you cast using the hat gains a special Somatic component: you must reach into the hat and "pull" the spell out of it.

Unknown Spell: While holding the hat, you can try to cast a level 1+ spell you don't know. The spell must be on the Wizard spell list, it must be of a level you can cast, and it can't have Material components costing more than 1,000 GP. Once you decide on the spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level. Then, to determine whether you cast the spell, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell using its normal casting time, and you can't use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. On a failed check, you fail to cast the spell and a random effect occurs instead, determined by rolling on the following table.

Any spell you cast from the hat uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.

1d100 | Effect
01-50 | You cast a random spell determined by rolling 1d10: on a 1, Enlarge/Reduce (enlarge effect); on a 2, Enlarge/Reduce (reduce effect); on a 3, Faerie Fire; on a 4, Fireball; on a 5, Gust of Wind; on a 6, Invisibility (cast on yourself); on a 7, Lightning Bolt; on an 8, Phantasmal Force; on a 9, Polymorph; on a 10, Stinking Cloud.
51-55 | You have the Stunned condition until the end of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened.
56-60 | A harmless swarm of butterflies fills a 10-foot Cube within 30 feet of yourself. The swarm disperses after 1 minute.
61-65 | You pull a nonmagical object out of the hat. Roll 1d4 to determine the object: on a 1, a vial of Acid; on a 2, a flask of Alchemist's Fire; on a 3, a Crowbar; on a 4, a lit Torch.
66-70 | You suffer a bout of "magic sickness" and have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour.
71-75 | You have the Petrified condition until the end of your next turn.
76-80 | You pull a nonmagical object out of the hat. Roll 1d4 to determine the object: on a 1, a Dagger; on a 2, a Rope with a Grappling Hook tied to one end; on a 3, a bag of Caltrops; on a 4, a gem worth 50 GP.
81-85 | A creature appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The creature isn't under your control and acts as it normally would, and it disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points.

Spellcasting Focus: You can use the hat as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

Unknown Spell: As a Magic action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a Long Rest.

<text>This helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing the helm.

Diamond Light: As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits a 30-foot Emanation. When at least one Undead is within that area, the Emanation is filled with Dim Light. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 Radiant damage.

Fire Opal Flames: As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage. The fl ames last until you take a Bonus Action to extinguish them or until you drop or stow the weapon.

Ruby Resistance: As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to Fire damage.

Spells: You can cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: Daylight (opal), Fireball (fire opal), Prismatic Spray (diamond), or Wall of Fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

Taking Fire Damage: Roll 1d20 if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm.

<text>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.

If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.

Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

Each creature in the Cone makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 Thunder damage and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried take 10d8 Thunder damage.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.

<text>You can take a Magic action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the Berserker stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of Horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many spirits it summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly by rolling on the following table. If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned spirits attack you.

If you meet the requirement, they are Friendly to you and your allies and follow your commands.

1d100 | Horn Type | Spirits | Requirement
01-40 | Horn of Valhalla, Silver | 2 | None
41-75 | Horn of Valhalla, Brass | 3 | Proficiency with all Simple weapons
76-90 | Horn of Valhalla, Bronze | 4 | Training with all Medium armor

    <text type="detail">Very rare</text>
<text>These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a Magic action.

While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above a surface. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores Difficult Terrain. In addition, the creature can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining Exhaustion levels from extended travel.

<text>As long as this weapon is within your reach and you are attuned to it, you and allies within 30 feet of you gain the following benefits.

Alarm: The weapon magically awakens each subject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. This benefit doesn't wake a subject from magically induced sleep.

Supernatural Readiness: Each subject has Advantage on its Initiative rolls.

Slow (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Two-Handed: A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

Proficiency: martial, firearm

<text>This iron rod has a button on one end. You can take a Utilize action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature takes a Utilize action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it defies gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can take a Utilize action to make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a successful check.

<text>While you are playing this musical instrument, you can take a Magic action to create harmless, illusory visual effects within a 5-foot Emanation originating from the instrument. If you are a Bard, the size of the Emanation increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing.

<text>This musical instrument has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While you are playing it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a Bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical Darkness. Casting the Dispel Magic spell on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.

<text>Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones are named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.

When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones orbiting your head at the same time.

Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.

As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it's orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped it.

While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic.

<text>Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones are named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.

When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones orbiting your head at the same time.

Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.

As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it's orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped it.

This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.

Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

<text>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature that can touch the bands, including the one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text type="detail">Legendary</text>
<text>While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you can take a Magic action to target a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask is empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't age and doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink.

You can take a Magic action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature in the flask. The creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn't know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.

An Identify spell reveals if the flask contains a creature, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly by rolling on the following table (see the the Monster Manual for the creature's stat block).

<text>Each time you make an attack roll with this magic weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.

Lightning Bolt: When you throw this weapon at a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms a 5-foot-wide Line between you and the target. The target and each other creature in the Line (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Slow (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Nick (Mastery): When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action in· stead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

Light: When you take the Attack action on your turn and. attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

<text>This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can't use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.

d20 | Golem | Time | Cost
1-5 | Manual of Clay Golems | 30 days | 65,000 GP
6-17 | Manual of Flesh Golems | 60 days | 50,000 GP
18 | Manual of Iron Golems | 120 days | 100,000 GP
19-20 | Manual of Stone Golems | 90 days | 80,000 GP

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.

Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.

<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The weapon has 5 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the weapon, hurling it as if it had Thrown with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

If the attack hits, the weapon unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the Stunned condition until the end of your next turn. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand. The weapon regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Giant's Bane: While you are attuned to the weapon and wearing either a Belt of Giant Strength or Gauntlets of Ogre Power to which you are also attuned, you gain the following benefits:

Giants' Bane: When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll made with this weapon against a Giant, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.

Might of Giants: The Strength score bestowed by your Belt of Giant Strength or Gauntlets of Ogre Power increases by 4, to a maximum of 30.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Heavy: You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and  your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

Two-Handed: A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

<text>When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate.

In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

<text>Of all the magic items created by elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a Moonblade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such weapon. Over the centuries, some of these weapons have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Others have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.

Every Moonblade longs for a bearer whose disposition and goals are compatible with its own. If you try to attune to a Moonblade that doesn't want you as its bearer, the weapon not only rejects you but also places a curse on you, causing you to make D20 Tests with Disadvantage for 24 hours or until the curse is ended by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic. If you're accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune appears on it. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A Moonblade functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen bearer.

A Moonblade has one rune on it for each bearer it has willingly served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the Moonblade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly by rolling on the Moonblade Properties table.

Minor Property: In addition to its aforementioned properties, each Moonblade has a minor property determined by rolling on the Magic Item's Minor Property table.

Sentience: A Moonblade is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet. Its alignment matches that of its creator.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate through visions or dreams when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

Personality: A Moonblade has a personality similar to that of its creator. Once a Moonblade has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the bearer's alignment differs from that of the weapon's or the bearer's goals later clash with the weapon's goals.

1d100 | Property
01-60 | Increase the weapon's bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the Moonblade already has a +3 bonus.
61-75 | When you hit with an attack roll using the Moonblade, you deal an extra 1d6 Force damage. Each time the weapon gains this property after the first, the extra damage increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 3d6. Reroll if the Moonblade already deals an extra 3d6 Force damage on a hit.
76-80 | The Moonblade gains Thrown with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack.
81-85 | The Moonblade scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
86-95 | You can take a Bonus Action to cause the Moonblade to flash brightly. Each other creature that is within 30 feet of you and not behind Total Cover must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can't use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
96-99 | The Moonblade has the properties of a Ring of Spell Storing.
100 | You can take a Magic action to conjure a spectral entity that resembles a shadowy elf if you don't already have one serving you. The entity appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the Shadow stat block with these changes: it is a Fey, has a Neutral alignment, and doesn't create new shadows. You control this entity, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 Hit Points or you dismiss it as a Magic action.

Graze (Mastery): If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

Heavy: You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and  your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

Two-Handed: A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

1d100 | Property
01-60 | Increase the weapon's bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the Moonblade already has a +3 bonus.
61-75 | When you hit with an attack roll using the Moonblade, you deal an extra 1d6 Force damage. Each time the weapon gains this property after the first, the extra damage increases by 1d6, to a maximum of 3d6. Reroll if the Moonblade already deals an extra 3d6 Force damage on a hit.
76-80 | The Moonblade gains Thrown with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack.
81-85 | The Moonblade scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
86-95 | You can take a Bonus Action to cause the Moonblade to flash brightly. Each other creature that is within 30 feet of you and not behind Total Cover must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can't use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
96-99 | The Moonblade has the properties of a Ring of Spell Storing.
100 | You can take a Magic action to conjure a spectral entity that resembles a shadowy elf if you don't already have one serving you. The entity appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the Shadow stat block with these changes: it is a Fey, has a Neutral alignment, and doesn't create new shadows. You control this entity, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 Hit Points or you dismiss it as a Magic action.

Vex (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: When you take the Attack action on your turn and. attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

Six types of magic beads exist. The DM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a Bonus Action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.

<text>This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the DM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.
After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.

Blowgun needles are used with a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

Needles are typically stored in a Pouch (bought separately).

When you attack a creature that has fewer than 100 Hit Points with this weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body.

Slow (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

<text>This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total). Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.

When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube.

No object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can't exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they're made from paste, cookies, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm.

<text>Long ago, in the Dragonlance setting, elves and humans waged a terrible war against chromatic dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and forged five Orbs of Dragonkind to help defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.

As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped over the centuries. Their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, but they also allow some measure of control over dragons.

Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those who try to wield an orb's magic but lack sufficient force of personality might find themselves under the orb's control.

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.

While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb's depths. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are Charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the DM decides.

Random Properties: An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties
	• 1 minor detrimental property
	• 1 major detrimental property

Spells: The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

Spell | Charge Cost
Cure Wounds (level 9 version) | 4
Daylight | 1
Death Ward | 2
Detect Magic | 0
Scrying (save DC 18) | 3

Call Dragons: While you control the orb, you can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

Destroying an Orb: An Orb of Dragonkind has AC 20 and is destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a Disintegrate spell. Nothing else can harm it.

<text>While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rat and giant rat are Indifferent toward you and won't attack you unless you threaten or harm them.

The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm of Rats with each expended charge if enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise.

Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes Friendly to you and your allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

<text>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can take a Magic action to unfold a Portable Hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the Portable Hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.

You can take a Magic action to close a Portable Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Heward's Handy Haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

<text>You have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While holding this weapon, you can cause it to emit green Dim Light out to 10 feet, either as a Bonus Action or after you roll Initiative, or you can extinguish the light as a Bonus Action.

While holding this weapon, you can take a Bonus Action to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.

In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties.

Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole Forms Only). While holding this weapon, you have Advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only). When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a Reaction to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your Armor Class against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can't use this property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only). This weapon has Thrown with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Curse: This weapon is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

In addition, while the weapon is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage from another creature in combat. On a failed save, you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 Hit Points or it does or until you can't reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.

You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting Banishment on the weapon forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The weapon then becomes a +1 Weapon with no other properties.

Vex (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

<text>While wearing this ring, you can take a Magic action to summon a particular Djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of yourself. It remains as long as you maintain Concentration, to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 Hit Points.

While summoned, the djinni is Friendly to you and your allies, and it obeys your commands. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.

After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.

Rings of Djinni Summoning are often created by the djinn they summon and given to mortals as gifts of friendship or tokens of esteem.

<text>You can cast Dancing Lights or Light from the ring.

The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.

Faerie Fire: You can expend 1 charge to cast Faerie Fire from the ring.

Lightning Spheres: You can expend 2 charges as a Magic action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot radius.

As a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind Total Cover, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage
1 | 4d12
2 | 5d4
3 | 2d6
4 | 2d4

Shooting Stars: You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a Magic action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

<text>This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.

Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 5 into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

Heads: Target one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d4 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

Tails: You take 1d4 Psychic damage.

<text>This black or dark-blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.

Six stars, located on the robe's upper-front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can take a Magic action to remove one of the stars and expend it to cast the level 5 version of Magic Missile. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.

While you wear the robe, you can take a Magic action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you take a Magic action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied or, if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.

<text>This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can take a Magic action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.

	• Bullseye Lantern (filled and lit)
	• Dagger
	• Mirror
	• Pole
	• Rope (coiled)

<text>While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn't create an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.

When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.

If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.

A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.

<text>This rod has the following properties.

Alertness: While holding the rod, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on Initiative rolls.

Spells: While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

	• Detect Evil and Good
	• Detect Magic
	• Detect Poison and Disease
	• See Invisibility

Protective Aura: As a Magic action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds Bright Light in a 60-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can sense the location of any Invisible creature that is also in the Bright Light.

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

<text>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

Buttons: You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form:

Button 1: A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head. The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.

Button 2: The rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

Button 3: The rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

Button 4: The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod's buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

Button 5: The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.

Button 6: The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

Drain Life: When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Paralyze: When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Terrify: While holding the rod, you can take a Magic action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

If harmed by you or your allies or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this way. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

<text>While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern, an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane's environment can't harm its occupants. Everything else that can be interacted with there can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden there disappears if it is taken outside the demiplane.

For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die. Also, creatures don't age while there, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).

When the time runs out or you take a Magic action to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod or an unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used, this property can't be used again until 10 days have passed.

<text>This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000 pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic action to command the other end of the rope to animate and move toward a destination you choose, up to the rope's length away from you. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet at the start of each of your subsequent turns until reaching its destination or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.

If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advantage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.

The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.

<text>This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target's space) or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

A target Restrained by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If you're still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a Reaction to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target's space.

The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.

<text>When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, that target takes an extra 15 Necrotic damage if it isn't a Construct or an Undead, and you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the amount of Necrotic damage taken.

Nick (Mastery): When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action in· stead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Light: When you take the Attack action on your turn and. attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

Finesse: When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Curse: This weapon is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it on your person at all times.

You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting Banishment on the weapon forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The weapon then becomes a +1 Weapon with no other properties.

81-85 | Scroll of Protection (Oozes)
86-90 | Scroll of Protection (Plants)
91-00 | Scroll of Protection (Undead)

Using a Magic action to read the scroll creates a 5-foot Emanation originating from you. For 5 minutes, creatures of the specified type can't enter or affect anything in the area. However, if you move in such a way that a creature of the specified type would be inside the area, the effect ends.

As a Magic action, a creature within 5 feet of the Emanation can attempt to overcome it, which forces the creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature ceases to be affected by the Emanation.

After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

<text>While holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to Armor Class. This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

The Shield has the following additional properties that you can use while holding it.

Forceful Bash: When you take the Attack, you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your Proficiency Bonus and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to the target equal to 2d6 + 2 plus your Strength modifier, and if the target is a creature, you can push it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock it down, giving it the Prone condition.

Protective Field: As a Reaction, when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot Emanation originating from you. When the Emanation appears, any creatures or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of effect that triggered the Reaction has no effect on creatures and objects inside the Emanation, which lasts as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emanation. A creature or object inside the Emanation can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation damage anything outside it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

<text>This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the DM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.

Sling bullets are used with a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

Sling Bullets are typically stored in a Pouch (bought separately).

<text>A Spell Scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without Material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn't lost.

If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you make a DC 10 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

If the spell requires a saving throw or an attack roll, the spell save DC is 13, and the attack bonus is +5.

Copying a Scroll into a Spellbook. A Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll can be copied into a spellbook. When a cantrip is copied in this way, the copier must succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana). On a successful check, the spell is copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the Spell Scroll is destroyed.

<text>A Spell Scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without Material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn't lost.

If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you make a DC 11 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

If the spell requires a saving throw or an attack roll, the spell save DC is 13, and the attack bonus is +5.

<text>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.

Controlling the Sphere: A Sphere of Annihilation is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.

While in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.

Sphere Interactions: If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the Gate spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a Portable Hole), the DM determines randomly what happens using the following table.

1d100 | Result
01-50 | The sphere is destroyed.
51-85 | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.
86-00 | A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere to a random plane of existence.

The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

<text>This staff has 20 charges and can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

Spells: While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

Regaining Charges: The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.

Retributive Strike: You can take a Magic action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its magic in an explosion that fills a 30-foot Emanation originating from itself. You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take Force damage equal to 16 times the number of charges in the staff. Each other creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes Force damage equal to 4 times the number of charges in the staff. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Insect Cloud: While holding the staff, you can take a Magic action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to fill a 30-foot Emanation originating from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area Heavily Obscured for creatures other than you. A strong wind (like that created by Gust of Wind) disperses the swarm and ends the effect.

<text>As a Bonus Action, you can turn the head of this staff into that of an animate, venomous snake for 1 minute or revert the staff to its inanimate form.

When you take the Attack action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the animated snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Apply your Proficiency Bonus and Wisdom modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage and 3d6 Poison damage.

The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has AC 15, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. If the head drops to 0 Hit Points, the staff is destroyed. As long as it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost Hit Points when it reverts to its inanimate form.

Spell Absorption: While holding the staff, you have Advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can take a Reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its Retributive Strike (see below).

<text>As a Magic action, you can throw this staff so that it lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, causing the staff to become a Giant Constrictor Snake in that space. The snake is under your control and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the Incapacitated condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. Absent commands from you, the snake defends itself.

As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake to revert to staff form in its current space, and you can't use the staff's property again for 1 hour. If the snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.

Tree Form: You can take a Magic action to plant one end of the staff in earth in an unoccupied space and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation magic that can be discerned with the Detect Magic spell. While touching the tree and using a Magic action, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when the tree reverts to a staff.

Regaining Charges: The staff regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.

<text>This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following additional properties. Once one of these properties is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Lightning: When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 Lightning damage (no action required).

Thunder: When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder audible out to 300 feet (no action required). The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the Stunned condition until the end of your next turn.

Thunder and Lightning: Immediately after you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can take a Bonus Action to use the Lightning and Thunder properties (see above) at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.

Lightning Strike: You can take a Magic action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a Line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that Line makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Thunderclap: You can take a Magic action to cause the staff to produce a thunderclap audible out to 600 feet. Every creature within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 Thunder damage and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

<text>This item appears to be a sword hilt.

Blade of Radiance: While grasping the hilt, you can take a Bonus Action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic weapon functions as a Longsword with Finesse. If you are proficient with Longswords or Shortswords, you are proficient with the Sun Blade.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage. When you hit an Undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

Sunlight: The sword's luminous blade emits Bright Light in a 15-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can take a Magic action to expand or reduce its radius of Bright Light and Dim Light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.

Sap (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

<text>Kas was a powerful warrior who served Vecna and whose loyalty was rewarded with this sword. As Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. The sword urged Kas to destroy Vecna and usurp his throne. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind.

Bloodthirst: The sword thirsts for blood. If the sword doesn't taste blood on its blade within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 Psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the Dominate Monster spell, and the sword demands blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.

Magic Weapon: You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword, which scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20 and deals an extra 2d10 Slashing damage to Undead.

Random Properties: The sword has the following random properties:

	• 1 minor beneficial property
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 1 minor detrimental property
	• 1 major detrimental property

Spells: While the sword is on your person, you can cast the following spells (save DC 18) from it:

	• Call Lightning
	• Divine Word
	• Finger of Death

Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.

Spirit of Kas: While the sword is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

Battle Hunger: You add 1d10 to your Initiative rolls.

Blade of Defense: When you take an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.

Necrotic Resistance: You have Resistance to Necrotic damage.

Sentience: The Sword of Kas is a sentient Chaotic Evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Common.

Personality: The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.

The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna.

Destroying the Sword: A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the Wish property of those combined Artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas, provided the sword is within 30 feet of the spell's caster. Upon casting Wish, the creature makes a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, nothing happens, and the Wish spell is wasted. On a successful save, the Sword of Kas is destroyed.

Sap (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

<text>While you are attuned to this magic weapon, your Strength is 20 unless your Strength is already equal to or greater than that score. The weapon deals an extra 1d8 Thunder damage to any creature it hits and an extra 3d8 Thunder damage to objects it hits that aren't being worn or carried.

The weapon has the following additional properties.

Clap of Thunder: As a Magic action, you can strike the weapon against a hard surface to create a loud clap of thunder audible out to 300 feet. You also create a 30-foot Cone of thunderous energy. Each creature in the Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Prone condition. Nonmagical objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried take 3d8 Thunder damage.

Earthquake: As a Magic action, you can strike the weapon against the ground to create an intense seismic disturbance in a 50-foot-radius circle centered on the point of impact. Structures in contact with the ground in that area take 50 Bludgeoning damage, and each creature on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. If that creature is also Concentrating, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or its Concentration is broken. In addition, you can cause a 30-foot-deep, 10-foot-wide fissure to open up on the ground anywhere in the area. Any creature on a spot where the fissure opens must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, falling into the fissure on a failed save or moving with the fissure's edge on a successful one. Any structure on a spot where the fissure opens collapses into the fissure. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Push (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

Two-Handed: A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

<text>This book has a desiccated tongue pinned to its front cover. Five of these tomes exist, and it's unknown which one is the original. The tongue on the first Tome of the Stilled Tongue belonged to a treacherous former servant of the lich Vecna. The tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The remaining pages are blank.

While attuned to this item, you can use it as a Spellbook and an Arcane Focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can take a Bonus Action to cast a spell you have written in this tome, without expending a spell slot or using any Verbal or Somatic components. Once used, this property of the tome can't be used again until the next dawn.

Only you can remove the tongue from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.

Vecna watches anyone using this tome and can write cryptic messages in it. These messages typically fade away after they are read.

Arrows are used with a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon).

<text>A creature hit by this ammunition must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have the Prone condition.

Crossbow bolts are used with a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

Bolts are typically stored in a Crossbow Bolt Case (bought separately).

<text>Crafted and wielded by Orcus, this ghastly wand slips from the demon lord's grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever the demon lord senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.

The wand is topped with a skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. All Holy Water within 10 feet of the wand is destroyed.

Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 Necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and, if it is a Humanoid, turns into a Zombie.

Magic Weapon: You can wield the wand as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 Necrotic damage on a hit.

Random Properties: The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 2 minor detrimental properties
	• 1 major detrimental property

The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus.

Protection: You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.

Spells: The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

Spell | Charge Cost
Animate Dead | 1
Blight | 2
Circle of Death | 3
Finger of Death | 3
Power Word Kill | 4
Speak with Dead | 1

While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).

Call Undead: While holding the wand, you can take a Magic action to conjure 15 Skeletons and 15 Zombies. These Undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until the next dawn, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until the next dawn.

While holding the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of Undead, not just skeletons and zombies. These Undead don't perish at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.

Sentience: The Wand of Orcus is a sentient Chaotic Evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.

The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Abyssal and Common.

Personality: The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.

To further Orcus's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.

Destroying the Wand: Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.

Bathing the wand in positive energy (such as that which permeates the Positive Plane) causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.

<text>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge while choosing a point within 120 feet of yourself. That location becomes the point of origin of a spell or other magical effect determined by rolling on the Wand of Wonder Effects table. Spells cast from the wand have a save DC of 15. If a spell's maximum range is normally less than 120 feet, it becomes 120 feet when cast from the wand. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM determines randomly which among them are affected.

Regaining Charges: The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

1d100 | Effect
01-20 | You cast a spell originating from the chosen point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a 1-2, Darkness; on a 3-4, Faerie Fire; on a 5-6, Fireball; on a 7-8, Slow; on a 9-10, Stinking Cloud.
21-25 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you have the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened.
26-30 | You cast Gust of Wind. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin.
31-35 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage.
36-40 | Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foot-high, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. During that time, the area of effect is Lightly Obscured.
41-45 | A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes, during which time the area of effect is Heavily Obscured.
46-50 | You cast Lightning Bolt. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin.
51-55 | The creature closest to the chosen point of origin is enlarged as if you had cast Enlarge/Reduce on it. If the target isn't you and can't be affected by that spell, you become the target instead.
56-60 | A magically formed creature appears in an unoccupied space as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. The creature isn't under your control, acts as it normally would, and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which creature appears. On a 1, a Rhinoceros appears; on a 2, an Elephant appears; and on a 3-4, a Rat appears.
61-64 | Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground, with the center of that circle as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that's already there grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.
65-68 | An object of the DM's choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the chosen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. If there are no such objects in range, nothing happens.
69-72 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you shrink as if you had cast Enlarge/Reduce on yourself and remain in that state for 1 minute.
73-77 | Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.
78-82 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
83-87 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you cast Invisibility on yourself.
88-92 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 x 10 gems, each worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand's tip in a Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the Line.
93-97 | You cast Polymorph, targeting the creature closest to the chosen point of origin. Roll 1d4 to determine the target's new form. On a 1, the new form is a Black Bear; on a 2, the new form is a Giant Wasp; on a 3-4, the new form is a Frog.
98-00 | The creature closest to the chosen point of origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the Restrained condition and begins to turn to stone. While Restrained in this way, the creature repeats the save at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failed save, the creature has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.

<text>Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, Wave is engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, the target takes an extra 21 Necrotic damage.

While holding Wave, you gain the following benefits:

Combat Ready: You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.

Underwater Adaptation: A bubble of air forms around your head while you are underwater, allowing you to breathe normally in that environment.

Aquatic Command: Wave has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you carry it, you can expend 1 charge to cast Dominate Beast (save DC 20) from it on a Beast that has a Swim Speed.

Globe of Invulnerability: While holding Wave, you can cast the level 9 version of Globe of Invulnerability from it. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Sentience: Wave is a sentient weapon of Neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Aquan.

Personality: Wave zealously encourages mortals to worship sea gods and has a habit of humming sea chanteys. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon's objectives in the world.

Destroying Wave: Wave can be destroyed only on the island of Thunderforge, where it was forged. The weapon must be melted down by a storm giant or someone imbued with a storm giant's strength. Destroying Wave angers a god of the sea, who sends powerful agents to attack the island and punish the destroyers.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

<text>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can take a Magic action to unfold the Well of Many Worlds and place it on a solid surface, whereupon it forms a two-way, 6-foot-diameter, circular portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads. The portal remains open until a creature within 5 feet of it takes a Magic action to close it by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.

Once the Well of Many Worlds has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.

<text>Whelm is a powerful weapon forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Hurl: Whelm has Thrown with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack roll using Whelm, the target takes an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 4d8 Force damage if the target is a Construct, an Elemental, or a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.

Shock Wave: You can take a Magic action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have the Stunned condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Supernatural Awareness: While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can cast Detect Evil and Good or Locate Object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.

Sentience: Whelm is a sentient, Lawful Neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin.

Personality: Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. Whelm's purpose is to protect dwarves. Conflict arises if the wielder doesn't share this goal.

Destroying Whelm: Whelm can be dissolved in the acidic bile of a recently slain ancient black dragon. It can also be melted down in the forges of the Mightyhammer dwarf clan, but only by the rightful leader of that clan.

Push (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Finesse: When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
