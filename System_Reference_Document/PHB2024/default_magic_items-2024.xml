    <weight>500</weight>
    <text>This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.
	The Apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30 ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren't extended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.
	To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
	The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute from pressure.
	A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.

Apparatus of the Crab Levers:
Lever | Up | Down
1 | Legs extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim. | Legs retract, reducing the apparatus's Speed and Swim Speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.
2 | Forward window shutter opens. | Forward window shutter closes.
3 | Side window shutters open (two per side). | Side window shutters close (two per side).
4 | Two claws extend from the front side of the apparatus. | The claws retract.
5 | Each extended claw makes the following melee attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. Hit: 7 (2d6) Bludgeoning damage. | Each extended claw makes the following melee attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. Hit: The target has the Grappled condition (escape DC 15).
6 | The apparatus walks or swims forward provided its legs are extended. | The apparatus walks or swims backward provided its legs are extended.
7 | The apparatus turns 90 degrees counterclockwise provided its legs are extended. | The apparatus turns 90 degrees clockwise provided its legs are extended.
8 | Eyelike fixtures emit Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. | The light turns off.
9 | The apparatus sinks up to 20 feet if it's in liquid. | The apparatus rises up to 20 feet if it's in liquid.
10 | The rear hatch unseals and opens. | The rear hatch closes and seals.

    <text>A young dwarf prince set out to forge a weapon that would be regarded as a symbol of unity among his people. Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, a god of creation, he first crafted four mighty tools: the Starmetal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With these tools, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.
	Armed with the Artifact, the prince brought peace to the dwarf clans, ending grudges and answering slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.
	Later, in an era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.

Magic Weapon: The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.
	When you attack a creature with the axe and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the axe deals an extra 20 Slashing damage.
	The axe has Thrown with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is a creature of the Giant type. Immediately after hitting or missing, the weapon flies back to your hand.

Blessings of Moradin: While attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:

Darkvision: You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.

Fortitude of Stone: Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.

Gifts of the Creator: You have proficiency with Brewer's Supplies, Mason's Tools, and Smith's Tools.

One with the Forge: You have Immunity to Poison damage and Resistance to Fire damage.

Sunder: When you hit an object with the axe, the object takes the maximum amount of damage possible.

Conjure Earth Elemental: While holding the axe, you can take a Magic action to summon an Earth Elemental. It appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. The elemental disappears after 24 hours, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.

Random Properties: The axe has the following random properties:

	• 2 minor beneficial properties
	• 1 major beneficial property
	• 2 minor detrimental properties

Travel the Depths: You can take a Magic action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast Teleport from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.

Destroying the Axe: The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for 50 years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Thrown: If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans.
	If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
	If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table or determine it randomly.

Bag of Beans:
1d100 | Effect
01 | 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.
02-10 | A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (DM's choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes.
11-20 | A Treant sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even roll, the treant is Chaotic Good.
21-30 | An animate but immobile stone statue in your likeness rises and makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours.
31-40 | A campfire with green flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is extinguished.
41-50 | Three Shrieker Fungi sprout.
51-60 | 1d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the DM's choice that acts in accordance with its alignment and nature. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink smoke.
61-70 | A hungry Bulette burrows up and attacks.
71-80 | A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined potions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.
81-90 | A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 Force damage from an internal explosion.
91-95 | A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a burial chamber containing a Mummy, a Mummy Lord, or some other Undead of the DM's choice. Its sarcophagus contains treasure of the DM's choice.
96-00 | A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the DM's choice. The top leads where the DM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant's castle, or another plane of existence.

    <type>W</type>
    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This bag resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.
	The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can take an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Another creature can take an action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, provided the puller isn't pulled inside the bag first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.
	Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.
	If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a Utilize action.
	If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. The bag holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
	Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward's Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can't be reopened.

	You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature in the Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are partially within the area are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.
	An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's Speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

Ammo: blowgun needle
Proficiency: martial, blowgun

Inhaled: These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

Fountain: The decanter produces 5 gallons of water.

Geyser: The decanter produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a Line 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. If you're holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser in one direction (no action required). One creature of your choice in the Line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition. Instead of a creature, you can target one object in the Line that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is knocked over by the geyser.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.
	The magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.
	Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.
	As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental or a Water Weird).

Ivory Goats (Rare): These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

Goat of Terror: This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance, and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.

Goat of Traveling: This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.

Goat of Travail: This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

    <text>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Vex (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

Light: When you take the Attack action on your turn and. attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

Loading: You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <weight>5</weight>
    <text>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.
	Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.
	If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.
	Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
	Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

Curse: This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the Identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the ar- mor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).

Each spirit uses the Berserker stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
	Four types of Horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many spirits it summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly by rolling on the following table. If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned spirits attack you.
	If you meet the requirement, they are Friendly to you and your allies and follow your commands.

Horn of Valhalla:

	While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above a surface. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores Difficult Terrain. In addition, the creature can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining Exhaustion levels from extended travel.

    <text>As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch adamantine statuette on the ground and, using a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a square adamantine tower. Repeating the command word causes the tower to revert to statuette form, which works only if the tower is empty. Each creature in the area where the tower appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried are also pushed clear of the tower.
	The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When created, the tower has a single door at ground level on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the Knock spell and similar magic.
	Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20; HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege equipment; and Resistance to all other damage. Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form doesn't repair damage to the tower. Only a Wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower). Each casting of Wish causes the tower to regain all its Hit Points.

	Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.
	As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it's orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped it.
	While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic.

	Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.
	As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it's orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped it.

While this dark-blue rhomboid orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.

A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic.

This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.
	Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
	While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

    <text>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.
	Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.
	A creature that can touch the bands, including the one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.
	Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you can take a Magic action to target a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask is empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't age and doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink.
	You can take a Magic action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature in the flask. The creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn't know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.
	An Identify spell reveals if the flask contains a creature, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen by the GM.

Curse: This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the Identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the ar- mor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).

    <text>This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can take a Magic action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't make Opportunity Attacks. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Sap (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

    <text>A creature subjected to Malice must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. The creature also has the Blinded condition while Poisoned in this way.

Inhaled: These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

    <text>This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can't use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.
	To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.
	Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.

Manual of Golems:
d20 | Golem | Time | Cost
1-5 | Manual of Clay Golems | 30 days | 65,000 GP
6-17 | Manual of Flesh Golems | 60 days | 50,000 GP

    <magic>YES</magic>
    <text>This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total). Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.
	When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube.
	No object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can't exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they're made from paste, cookies, or some other worthless material.
	If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm.

    <weight>50</weight>
    <text>When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.
	If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it.
	Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.
	An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.
	If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.
	While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate.
	In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.
	Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

    <text>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Deck of Many Things table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.
	Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.
	Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)

Mysterious Deck:
1d100 (13-Card Deck) | 1d100 (22-Card Deck) | Card
— | 01-05 | Balance
— | 06-10 | Comet
— | 11-14 | Donjon
01-08 | 15-18 | Euryale

97-00 | 97-00 | Void

Each card's effect is described below.

Balance: You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can't decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.

Comet: The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect.

Donjon: You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

Euryale: The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.

Fates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

Flames: A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

Fool: You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws.

Gem: Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.

Jester: You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

Key: A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon.

Knight: You gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.

Moon: You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.

Puzzle: Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

Rogue: An NPC of the DM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

Ruin: All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the Dungeon Master's Guide), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

Sage: At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.

Skull: An Avatar of Death appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life.

Star: Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.

Sun: A magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.

Talons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.

Throne: You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.

Void: Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A Wish spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.

	Six types of magic beads exist. The DM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a Bonus Action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.

Life Stealing: The weapon has 1d8 + 1 charges. When you attack a creature that has fewer than 100 Hit Points with this weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body. Constructs and Undead succeed on the save automatically. The weapon loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the weapon has no charges remaining, it loses this property.

Nick (Mastery): When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action in· stead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

Light: When you take the Attack action on your turn and. attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

    <text>While wearing this armor, you have Resistance to one of the following damage types: Bludgeoning. Piercing, or Slashing. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly.

Curse: This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the Identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the ar- mor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).

    <text>A creature subjected to Pale Tincture must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition. The Poisoned creature repeats the save every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage on a failed save. The damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means while the creature remains Poisoned. After seven successful saves against the poison, the creature is no longer Poisoned.

Ingested: A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

    <text>These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a Magic action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours.

    <text>While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rat and giant rat are Indifferent toward you and won't attack you unless you threaten or harm them.
	The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm of Rats with each expended charge if enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise.
	Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes Friendly to you and your allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.

    <text>While wearing this armor, you have Resistance to one of the following damage types: Bludgeoning. Piercing, or Slashing. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly.

Curse: This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the Identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the ar- mor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).

    <text>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
	You can take a Magic action to unfold a Portable Hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the Portable Hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.
	You can take a Magic action to close a Portable Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.
	If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
	Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Heward's Handy Haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

	While summoned, the djinni is Friendly to you and your allies, and it obeys your commands. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.
	After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.
	Rings of Djinni Summoning are often created by the djinn they summon and given to mortals as gifts of friendship or tokens of esteem.

    <text>You can cast Dancing Lights or Light from the ring.
	The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.

Faerie Fire: You can expend 1 charge to cast Faerie Fire from the ring.

Lightning Spheres: You can expend 2 charges as a Magic action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.
	Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot radius.
	As a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind Total Cover, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

Lightning Spheres:
Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage
1 | 4d12
2 | 5d4
3 | 2d6
4 | 2d4

Shooting Stars: You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a Magic action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

	Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 5 into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
	While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

    <weight>2</weight>
    <text>While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn't create an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.
	When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.
	If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.
	A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.

    <text>This rod has the following properties.

Alertness: While holding the rod, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on Initiative rolls.

Spells: While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

	• Detect Evil and Good
	• Detect Magic
	• Detect Poison and Disease
	• See Invisibility

Protective Aura: As a Magic action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds Bright Light in a 60-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can sense the location of any Invisible creature that is also in the Bright Light.
	The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

Buttons: You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form:

Button 1: A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head. The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.

Button 2: The rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

Button 3: The rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

Button 4: The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod's buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

Button 5: The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.

Button 6: The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

Drain Life: When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Paralyze: When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

Terrify: While holding the rod, you can take a Magic action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>You can take a Magic action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for 8 hours. While Charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your allies or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this way. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

    <text>While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern, an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane's environment can't harm its occupants. Everything else that can be interacted with there can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden there disappears if it is taken outside the demiplane.
	For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die. Also, creatures don't age while there, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).
	When the time runs out or you take a Magic action to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod or an unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used, this property can't be used again until 10 days have passed.

    <text>This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000 pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic action to command the other end of the rope to animate and move toward a destination you choose, up to the rope's length away from you. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet at the start of each of your subsequent turns until reaching its destination or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
	If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advantage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.
	The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.

    <text>This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a Magic action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target's space) or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand).
	A target Restrained by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If you're still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a Reaction to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target's space.
	The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.

Curse: This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.

Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn't lost.
	If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you make a DC 18 ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.
	If the spell requires a saving throw or an attack roll, the spell save DC is 18, and the attack bonus is +10.

Copying a Scroll into a Spellbook: A Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll can be copied into a spellbook. When a level 8 spell is copied in this way, the copier must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana). On a successful check, the spell is copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the Spell Scroll is destroyed.

    <text>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.
	The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.
Controlling the Sphere: A Sphere of Annihilation is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.
	While in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.
Sphere Interactions: If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the Gate spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a Portable Hole), the DM determines randomly what happens using the following table.

Sphere of Annihilation:
1d100 | Result
01-50 | The sphere is destroyed.
51-85 | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.
86-00 | A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere to a random plane of existence.

Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse.

    <text>As a Magic action, you can throw this staff so that it lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, causing the staff to become a Giant Constrictor Snake in that space. The snake is under your control and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours.
	On your turn, you can mentally command the snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the Incapacitated condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. Absent commands from you, the snake defends itself.
	As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake to revert to staff form in its current space, and you can't use the staff's property again for 1 hour. If the snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.

    <text>This staff has 6 charges and can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

Spells: While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

Staff of the Woodlands:
Spell | Charge Cost
Animal Friendship | 1
Awaken | 5
Barkskin | 2
Locate Animals or Plants | 2
Pass without Trace | 2
Speak with Animals | 1
Speak with Plants | 3
Wall of Thorns | 6

Tree Form: You can take a Magic action to plant one end of the staff in earth in an unoccupied space and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation magic that can be discerned with the Detect Magic spell. While touching the tree and using a Magic action, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when the tree reverts to a staff.

Regaining Charges: The staff regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

    <text>This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following additional properties. Once one of these properties is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Lightning: When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 Lightning damage (no action required).

Thunder: When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder audible out to 300 feet (no action required). The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the Stunned condition until the end of your next turn.

Thunder and Lightning: Immediately after you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can take a Bonus Action to use the Lightning and Thunder properties (see above) at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.

Lightning Strike: You can take a Magic action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a Line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that Line makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Thunderclap: You can take a Magic action to cause the staff to produce a thunderclap audible out to 600 feet. Every creature within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 Thunder damage and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

Topple (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Curse: This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the Identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the ar- mor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).

	Blade of Radiance: While grasping the hilt, you can take a Bonus Action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic weapon functions as a Longsword with Finesse. If you are proficient with Longswords or Shortswords, you are proficient with the Sun Blade.
	You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage. When you hit an Undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

Sunlight: The sword's luminous blade emits Bright Light in a 15-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can take a Magic action to expand or reduce its radius of Bright Light and Dim Light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.

Sap (Mastery): If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

Finesse: When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Versatile: A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Pure Rebuke: The talisman has 7 charges. While wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is a Fiend or an Undead, it has Disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn't cast into the fissure but takes 4d6 Psychic damage from the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of golden light and is destroyed.

	When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it has Immunity to Slashing damage, if it doesn't have or need a head, or if the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 30 Slashing damage from the hit. If the creature has Legendary Resistance, it can expend one daily use of that trait to avoid losing its head, taking the extra damage instead.

Graze (Mastery): If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

Light: When you take the Attack action on your turn and. attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

Wand of Wonder:
1d100 | Effect
01-20 | You cast a spell originating from the chosen point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a 1-2, Darkness; on a 3-4, Faerie Fire; on a 5-6, Fireball; on a 7-8, Slow; on a 9-10, Stinking Cloud.
21-25 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you have the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened.
26-30 | You cast Gust of Wind. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin.
31-35 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage.
36-40 | Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foot-high, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. During that time, the area of effect is Lightly Obscured.
41-45 | A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes, during which time the area of effect is Heavily Obscured.
46-50 | You cast Lightning Bolt. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin.
51-55 | The creature closest to the chosen point of origin is enlarged as if you had cast Enlarge/Reduce on it. If the target isn't you and can't be affected by that spell, you become the target instead.
56-60 | A magically formed creature appears in an unoccupied space as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. The creature isn't under your control, acts as it normally would, and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which creature appears. On a 1, a Rhinoceros appears; on a 2, an Elephant appears; and on a 3-4, a Rat appears.
61-64 | Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground, with the center of that circle as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that's already there grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.
65-68 | An object of the DM's choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the chosen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. If there are no such objects in range, nothing happens.
69-72 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you shrink as if you had cast Enlarge/Reduce on yourself and remain in that state for 1 minute.
73-77 | Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.
78-82 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
83-87 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you cast Invisibility on yourself.
88-92 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 x 10 gems, each worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand's tip in a Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the chosen point of origin.

93-97 | You cast Polymorph, targeting the creature closest to the chosen point of origin. Roll 1d4 to determine the target's new form. On a 1, the new form is a Black Bear; on a 2, the new form is a Giant Wasp; on a 3-4, the new form is a Frog.
98-00 | The creature closest to the chosen point of origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the Restrained condition and begins to turn to stone. While Restrained in this way, the creature repeats the save at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends.
